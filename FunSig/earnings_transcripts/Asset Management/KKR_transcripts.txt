===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in the listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. I'm going to begin this morning by reviewing our results for the quarter before Rob walks through the current environment, its impact on our key business drivers, as well as our strategic positioning longer term. Scott will then finish with some closing thoughts. So, beginning with our headline financial results for the quarter, fee-related earnings per share came in at $0.92, up 22% year-over-year. Total operating earnings of $1.24 per share are up 16% year-over-year. And adjusted net income of $1.15 per share is up 19% compared to a year ago. All of these figures are among the highest we reported as a public company and are reflective of a diversified and global business model built over the last decade-plus. Going into our quarterly results in a little more detail, management fees in Q1 were $917 million, up 13% year-over year driven by fundraising and deployment activities. If anything, management fee growth in the quarter feels understated relative to the breadth of the $31 billion of new capital that we raised in Q1. The largest component of this $31 billion was capital raised for North America 14, the latest vintage of our flagship North America private equity strategy, which had not turned on as of March 31st. And therefore, did not contribute to management fees in the quarter. Rob is going to give a little bit of a more fulsome update on America's 14 in a few minutes. Total transaction and monitoring fees were $262 million in the quarter. Capital markets transaction fees were $229 million driven primarily by activity in new and existing portfolio companies within both private equity and infrastructure. Fee related performance revenues were $21 million in the quarter. So, altogether, fee related revenues came in at $1.2 billion. That's up 22% year-over-year. Turning to expenses, fee-related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 17.5% of fee related revenues. Other operating expenses were $168 million for the quarter. So, in total, fee related earnings were $823 million or the $0.92 per share that I mentioned a moment ago with an FRE margin of 69%. Insurance segment operating earnings were $259 million and strategic holdings operating earnings were $31 million. Both of which were in line to modestly ahead of our recent guidance. In terms of our strategic holdings segment, we've closed on our purchase of additional stakes in three existing core private equity businesses as we introduced on our call last quarter. We continue to feel that our strategic holdings business is a real differentiator for us. And these transactions are a further accelerant for this segment. Today, our share of annual revenue and EBITDA across the 18 company portfolio is approximately $3.8 billion and $920 million, respectively. Again, that's our share. And since quarter end, we've announced the acquisition of a new core private equity investment, Karo Healthcare, which will bring our strategic holdings portfolio to 19 companies. So, altogether, total operating earnings were $1.24 per share. As a reminder, total operating earnings is comprised of our fee related earnings together with our insurance and strategic holdings operating earnings, which represent the more recurring components of our earnings streams. Over the last 12 months, total operating earnings comprised nearly 80% of total segment earnings. So, said differently, nearly 80% of our pretax earnings over the last 12 months were driven by more recurring earnings streams highlighting the durability of our business, especially during periods of volatility. Turning now to investing earnings within our asset management segment, realized performance income was $348 million and realized investment income was $218 million for total monetization activity of $566 million. That's up almost 40% year-over-year. This quarter activity was largely driven by the annual crystallization of carry from Core PE as well as other monetization events across traditional PE as well as growth equity. Turning to investment performance and looking at page 10 of our earnings release. The private equity portfolio was up 4% in the quarter and up 11% over the last 12 months. This was a quarter where investment performance was undoubtedly helped by the geographic diversification of our firm as European and Asian equity indices were both up in the quarter. In real assets, the opportunistic real estate portfolio was up 2% in the quarter and up 5% over the LTM. Infrastructure was up 4% in the quarter and appreciated 13% over the LTM. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite was flat in the quarter and up 7% over the last 12 months. And the alternative credit composite was up 3% in the quarter and up 11% over the last 12 months. And finally, consistent with historical practice, we increased our dividend to $0.74 per share on an annualized basis or $18.5 per share per quarter, beginning with this quarter. This is now the sixth consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure, increasing our annualized dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.74 over this period of time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. We've all experienced some real volatility particularly sincerely April. It is in this type of environment that our business model and collaborative culture uniquely positions us. And we are using that to lean in and source attractive investment opportunities around the globe for our clients. As we navigate this volatility, there are a number of themes and questions that we have consistently been hearing from our shareholders and clients. So, I thought, I would spend my time this morning walking through a number of common areas of focus. The first is the impact of tariffs on our existing portfolio. As a starting point, it is important to remember that tariffs and supply chain diversification and resilience have been front-of-mind topics for our investment, public affairs, and macro teams dating back to the global pandemic. As a result, for five-plus years now, this has been a standard topic of conversation. Taking a look at our global private equity portfolio today, this includes traditional, core, and growth. Based on our initial findings, we estimate that 90% of our AUM has limited to know first store impact from the announced tariffs. Importantly, this figure does not include identified mitigating measures that we are actively implementing. And specifically, our core private equity portfolio and our strategic holding segment are not expected to have any material impact from tariffs. Across our infrastructure platform, the vast majority of our companies have either contractual protections that insulate KKR returns or minimal estimated exposure. Looking at our infrastructure deployment over the last five years, approximately 70% has been in Europe and in Asia. And as we look at our credit portfolio, there will be pockets of exposure. But we believe the opportunities, and we really do think this is a credit picker's market, will outweigh the downsides. So while we expect there will be individual instances of direct tariff impact in parts of the portfolio, based on how we understand tariffs today, we feel well-equipped to manage these challenges and on the whole feel very good with how our portfolio is positioned. The second theme that I wanted to cover this morning is the effect on both the deployment and the monetization environment. We find ourselves in the fortunate position of being ready as a firm to play offense on behalf of our clients. Volatility brings opportunity, and we benefit from the global and connected nature of our firm. We've closed or committed to over $30 billion worth of new investments since the start of the year. Within private markets, these investments are diversified across geographies, with more than half coming outside the U.S. Notably, multiple of these investments are in Japan, where we continue to be at the forefront of activity, including the purchases of Fuji Soft and Topcon in our private equity strategy. Looking only at investments that we announced over the last month, so when the tariff related volatility began we committed over $10 billion of equity. This includes $7 billion in private markets across global opportunities in traditional PE, core PE, infrastructure, and tech growth, to name a few, and another $3 billion in private credit across direct lending, high-grade ABF, and junior debt. Moving next to monetizations, we think we remain really well positioned here. Our discipline around investment pacing and linear deployment has definitely contributed to the overall strength and maturity of our portfolio. At quarter end, our gross unrealized performance income stands at $8.7 billion. It's a high point for us and up over 25% year-on-year. I think this number in particular stands out given our healthy level of monetizations over the past 12 months. As a result of our mature and global portfolio and strong investment performance, we are better positioned and some might expect in terms of realization activity, even the face of the market volatility. To give you a sense, looking at our pending monetizations, so this is based on transactions that are signed, but not yet closed, we have direct line of sight to north of $800 million of monetization related revenue, most of which will be performance income. This includes exits of Seiyu in Japan, Kito Crosby in the U.S., and foreign infrastructure investments to name a few of the key drivers. Of that $800 plus million, we expect at least $250 million to be generated in Q2. It's a very healthy figure for us as we stand here in just early May. The third theme that I wanted to hit on is the impact on our capital raising efforts. We are actively engaged with our clients. Part of this is making sure they know what is happening with their portfolios. But a lot of it is discussing how to invest into these markets and ways that we can work together. We've heard a range of responses and they are evolving with the market. While it may be early as we see how this all plays out, today there are no changes to our targets and we have continued conviction in our fundraising outlook. Total new capital raised in the quarter was $31 billion and it's worth spending a minute on our North America private equity strategy. In April, we completed the initial close period to North America at $14 billion. It's a great first step for us and reflects in our view the strong investment returns we've delivered on behalf of our clients alongside a differentiated return of capital profile. And remember, our approach here stands in contrast relative to many in our industry as we raise traditional PE funds focused across North America, Europe and Asia, compared to the global funds you often see from our competitors. This approach, we think, has allowed us to raise more capital. As of 331, we had over $40 billion of committed capital across our active traditional private equity flagship funds and has also allowed for more diversified carried interest profile at the same time. And this doesn't include committed capital across core private equity, mid-market and our growth strategies. Looking at another important piece of capital raising private wealth, our K-Series suite of vehicles continues to maintain traction. Across the four investing verticals, AUM was at $22 billion including activity that closed April 1, 2025. This compares to $9 billion a year ago. Our North Star for the K-Series suite continues to be focused on building vehicles that we can be proud of 10 plus years from now. As a result, recognizing that we don't read too much into the month-to-month sales, we continue to be encouraged by our performance, deployment and the capital raising activity. And earlier this week, the two public private credit solutions created an exclusive partnership with Capital Group have launched. We are similarly focused on building these products for long-term success. And as we look ahead to the second-half of the year, we would expect to give you an update on the private equity and real asset product launches. In addition, work is underway to extend access for individuals interested in private markets through model portfolios and target date funds. Turning next to insurance, we are now a year plus into owning 100% of Global Atlantic and we are progressing well on our path to modestly evolving how we source both liabilities and assets, including raising more third party capital, elongating our liability profile and sourcing additional alternatives. This addition of longer dated alternatives to the portfolio, where we think that we have a differentiated sourcing advantage, will drive up overall returns, while at the same time naturally reducing leverage over time. Financial performance here begins with Insurance segment operating earnings. In Q1, as you would have heard from Craig, we reported $259 million, which was in line with our expectations. And consistent with our comments last quarter, I would expect insurance operating earnings to stay in that $250 million plus or minus level during the next few quarters. This line item alone does not capture though how our model works and the overall impact of our insurance related economics. A lot of it appropriately shows up in our Asset Management segment. Firstly, management fees from our Ivy sidecar vehicles as well as strategic partnerships. This capital allows us to grow GA in a very capital efficient way, and there is more to come here. As an example, Japan Post Insurance announced in Q1 their intention to expand our existing strategic partnership and make a new $1 business to $2 billion investment here. Number two, capital markets fees, where we've just begun to scratch the surface. We see the potential to generate several hundred million of additional annual revenues over time. In 2024, that number was closer to $50 million. And finally, the management fees charged for our investment management agreement with Global Atlantic, critically even while we are in the process of shifting our strategy to emphasize longer duration and more private market assets. Our all-in pre-tax ROE of our insurance business is approaching 20%, with a clear path to 20-plus percent returns as we get all the elements of the business working well together. The last theme that I want to go through before handing it off to Scott is around the durability of our model, which provides us with a significant amount of both stability and visibility. Over 90% of our capital is perpetual or committed for an average of eight years or more. Today, we have $116 billion of committed but uncalled capital. And if you look at our management fees, they are largely calculated on committed or invested capital. And therefore, not influenced by marks and corresponding NAVs. And finally, we have a record amount of capital on which we're not yet earning fees, with $64 billion committed with a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points. That turns on when the capital is either invested or enters its investment period. Just to put that $64 billion figure into perspective, it is up almost 50% compared to one year ago. So, we benefit from real stability of management fees and increased visibility on how they will grow. And finally, our business is global and diversified. Almost half of our investment professionals sit outside of the U.S. And looking specifically at our management fees, they are well diversified across asset classes. Over the last 12 months, management fees across private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies were each over $1 billion. And in aggregate, have grown at a high teens CAGR over the past three years. We don't think that there are any asset management firms that combine our scale, growth profile, and diversification. Now I'll end where I started. This is an environment where our people and our model really should excel. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Rob. And thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. Given the recent volatility and uncertainty, I want to spend a few minutes on how we're navigating this environment and address what else may be on your minds. Before I do that, some context; today is KKR's 49th birthday. We were founded on this day in 1976. And I have been here nearly 29 of those 49 years. Over this period, the firm has seen a number of cycles and dislocations. In our experience, times like this yield some very attractive investment opportunities. The key is to use our global and diversified business model with significant locked-up capital and $116 billion of dry powder to keep investing when others are scared. These periods always end. And we typically look back and wish we had invested more when the world is most uncertain. We are running the firm with those lessons in mind. We did a good job leaning into the COVID dislocation. And we're approaching this environment with the same mindset. As Rob mentioned, we've announced over $10 billion of investments in the last four weeks since the tariff announcement. And we have significant pipelines across our businesses. So, you should expect to continue to see us investing into this environment. No doubt some sale processes may be delayed if this continues. But it is times like this where we see the benefit of being very global, as Asia and Europe are less impacted so far, and multi-asset class and connected, as companies still need capital but may prefer debt over equity if valuations are down. So, we are optimistic about deployment. And the returns we will see from this vintage. We're also sure you have questions about what this means for monetizations. As Rob mentioned, we have a mature portfolio and benefit from linear and disciplined deployment. As such, we have record embedded gains in our portfolio. And those gains are global and across asset classes. Here again, we have good line of sight and several assets in sale processes. So, we remain of the view that we can monetize gains in this environment. And if we do decide to delay some processes, that just means we will likely monetize more next year. And we're sure you also have some questions about fundraising. We want you to have our views and some facts. As an example, China-based LPs make up a low single-digit percentage of our AUM. Some may delay decisions in this environment, but we don't expect material impact. We're also watching private wealth flows, which have not been affected to date. These markets are in adoption phase, and we have a long history of outperforming in down markets. So, this period could actually accelerate adoption over time. And we think our partnership with Capital Group will accelerate that adoption as well. And remember, a good portion of our fundraising comes through Global Atlantic. We expect annuity demands to be largely unaffected in this environment. And it could be positively impacted as investors focus on safety and quality. In short, given our momentum and the diversity of our global fundraising channels, we remain confident we will continue to raise scaled capital. Stepping back, you're also likely wondering if we have changed our view of what we are capable of achieving as a firm. We have not. Joe and I shared 2026 guidance last year. We still feel good about those numbers across both our fundraising and financial metrics. When you cut through it, we believe that while this dislocation may be different for a variety of reasons, the key is to stay focused on what we control and to not waste the opportunities it affords. We will continue investing, speaking with our clients, finding new themes, and looking for strategic opportunities, some of which are only available in times of distress. Times like this reveal experience, culture, and business model durability. And they give us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves with performance, client engagement, and strategic action, so that we emerge stronger as a firm and as investors. That's our focus and intent. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Scott, Rob. Happy 49th birthday and hope everyone's doing well. Our question is on your Asia business. So, we all know that you have the largest private markets business across Asia. So, we're curious in your perspective on what the emerging trade war means for your strategy, your ability to fundraise and also investing effort across the region.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Craig. No change to our strategy. One of the things we talked about in the prepared remarks is that we learned a lot going through Trump 1.0 and thinking about tariff implications. I learned a lot during COVID about supply chains as an example. So, we have been looking at investments across asset classes with those lessons and the benefit of that timeframe in mind. So, no change to our strategy. Our effort, as you know, is cross-asset class and pan-Asian. And so, we have efforts across private equity, real estate, infra, credit, the beginnings of an insurance effort, nine offices across the region approaching 600 people. So, we think it is a big opportunity for us as a firm and we see a lot of growth ahead. On the margin, one of our themes for a while has been intra-Asia trade as just an example. We think that's going to be an even bigger opportunity now on the back of this. And perhaps as investors stay focused on being even more global with their portfolios, I would say January, February, there was a little bit of a bent toward maybe I should have more in the U.S. On the margin, I think it's going to be beneficial to Asia flows if people decide to stay more global. And so, it's something that I think will benefit us, given our scale in the region.
Craig Larson: And then, Craig, it's Craig. I was just going to add some numbers to this. I think you're probably aware of this. I know you spent a healthy amount of time in the region yourself. But at the end of 2019, we had $21 billion of AUM. Almost 90% was in private equity. And looking at Q1 '25, we had about $70 billion of AUM with traditional PE comprising just below 50% of that. So, as Scott noted, meaningful growth with meaningful diversification at the same time.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Craig. Just for my follow-up, I heard your commentary towards the end of the call on the resilience of private wealth flows and actually the potential for an acceleration coming out of this correction. Do you see the strong relative performance to date or the very low adoptions as the key drivers? And was that comment really brought across asset class? Because I know you're doing very well in particular in private equity, just given CapEx strong recent performance.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, I think it all really is a comment on our ability to perform through a cycle, Craig. And so, the comment was more if the public markets pull back, that's when we tend to outperform by even more. So, if the private wealth channel, which is newer to the alternative space, has that experience, we think over time that could actually accelerate adoption. So, it was more of a forward-looking comment. You're right, we haven't really seen impact flows as of yet. Craig will walk through some numbers in a minute. But for us, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been around a long time. We've seen a lot of cycles. And we're a learning organization. And so, we learned a lot of lessons during the financial crisis. And one of those was the importance of linear deployment and portfolio construction. As we've been talking about it for a long time. We've been implementing it for a long time. It's now coming through the results. And so, the bigger performance point I think is going to start to shine through and show how differentiated we are. So, just to take one example, America's private equity over the last eight years, we've returned two times the amount of capital that we've called. And that's in a business that's been growing. And so, we think this is going to allow us to outperform over time in terms of capital access. And we do see it as a go-forward advantage across channels. So, private wealth is part of that. But we also see the benefit across institutional and everything else we do. Craig, you want to give an update on private wealth?
Craig Larson: Yes, we were looking at the stats through April. If you look at Q3 and Q4, we were below that $3 billion of new capital raised in Q3. Write it about that in Q4. In Q1, we'd raised $4 billion across the K-Series for the quarter. And when we look at activity at this point through April, so one-month period, we're right at about that billion level. So, it feels like a healthy month for us. It's interesting when you look at overall flows in particular for private equity and infrastructure. In Q1, roughly half of those were inside the U.S., roughly half outside the U.S. And based, again, on this preliminary data for the month of April, we're, again, very diversified with a pretty equal split, both inside and outside the U.S. So, again, overall, tough to read too much into any four weeks of data, particularly April of 2025, but at this point, things feel okay.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. So, zooming out a little bit, the comments over the course of your prepared remarks suggested a much more resilient business, perhaps what's perceived in the market today. You talked about monetization not quite falling off the cliff; deployment, dry powder, really healthy. It sounds like you're not really changing the outlook for fundraising either. So, the question obviously is with the stock doing what it's done over the last few months, why not step up the buyback here? I know it's a dynamic approach you guys have talked about in the past, and you're looking to generate the best return on investment capital. But if not now, when? And maybe you guys can also hit on expectations for putting the $2 billion plus of Convert to Work and kind of how you're thinking about use of those proceeds.
Robert Lewin: Great, Alex. It's Rob. Why don't I start? So we've been very consistent as it relates to capital allocation for some time. And I really do think the most important thing for any capital allocation process is consistency. And we've got two goals. One of which is to make sure that every marginal dollar of free cash flow is going to generate the most amount of long-term earnings per share. And the second goal, closely related, is to make sure that we are increasing the quality of those earnings. So, more durability, more resilience, more recurring nature of those earnings, and every marginal dollar of free cash flow we look at through that lens. And we've talked about four areas of using our capital base to accomplish those goals. One of which is share buybacks. The other three are core private equity, strategic M&A, and insurance. Share buybacks, as over the past several years, have been a really important part of our capital allocation framework and use of capital. And I've got every confidence that as we look forward, and as we think about using our capital, share buybacks will continue to be a core part of how we think about capital allocation. But we also don't have a framework that puts a specific amount in any one bucket. To us, it's all about how do we take that marginal dollar of cash flow and derive the most amount of earnings per share across our business over a long period of time with the most amount of durability and resilience to that cash flow. And we're going to take that same lens. And as I said, I would expect that share buybacks, as we look forward, will continue to be a very important part of that allocation framework. And maybe the last point, because I think anytime you're talking about capital allocation, it's important to point this out. KKR senior management own roughly 30% of KKR. So, any decision that we take around capital structure, around capital allocation, you briefly mentioned the convert we did a couple of months ago, is really through that lens in a way that is highly aligned with our shareholder base. And that's really the approach that we've taken. And if you look at share buybacks historically, we've used our capital base to retire roughly 10% of our shares outstanding, 15% of our free floats. We've done so at an average price of roughly $28 per share. And so, we like our historical body of work and would expect that going forward, we're going to continue to be able to find accretive ways to put that capital work for all of our shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is [Manu] (ph) on for Bill. Happy birthday to you guys, just wanted to say that.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe a question on asset-backed finance, maybe update us on the platform as we go into the balance of 2025. Some color on expanding the sourcing funnel and bank partnerships.
Craig Larson: Hey, Manu, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Glad you asked about. So, look first on page 13 of our release. This is the page that details our credit and liquid strategies business. We break out the composition of the AUM in that piece. And if you look overall, total credit AUM up 10%, year-over-year, 280 plus billion of AUM. The private credit component is growing at even a faster rate. So, we've got 117 billion of AUM up 26%. And within that private credit piece, 74 billion of that is an asset-based finance. And ABF year-over-year has grown at a number between 35% and 40%. So, the asset-based finance business, it's a big business for us. Our scale here is probably larger than someone might expect. And so, back to your question on how we're positioned at this market. Look, it's a lot of the same things you would have heard from us historically; massive end market, 6 trillion on its way to 9. In our view, you've got really high barriers to entry. There's a lack of scale capital with, as you noted, a number of traditional providers, in our view, leaving this market and are creating a void. So, we're continuing to find attractive risk-reward. I think our clients like the diversification away from the corporate credit cycle. And in terms of the current environment, we think this is a very good environment for asset-based finance. We think companies are still going to look to be efficient with volatile markets as companies look to finance themselves. We think companies will continue to look for creative ways to finance themselves off balance sheet. Again, as we think about banks, we think our opportunity set will continue to increase. And if you look at overall asset-based finance deployment for us, it was a little over $4 billion in Q1. Over the trailing 12 months, we're at about $21 billion. So, again, it's a healthy part of deployment for us. Just to give you a frame of reference, 2023, that number was at about $8 billion. So, you're seeing really significant growth for us in a number of different asset classes. It just feels like there's a lot more for us to do.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a two-in-one on capital markets fees. I know sometimes you'll kind of give a look into how Q2 is shaking up, so I was wondering if you could do that. But I'm also curious, in the slide deck, you noted that about two-thirds of transaction fees were debt-focused in the quarter. Can you talk about what is that historically? Is this sort of a function of a changing environment, or part of a more explicit strategy to kind of broaden the type of business you're doing there? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Great. Ben, thanks a lot for the question. Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, because it's the shorter part of the answer. Roughly, we've been at that two-thirds level over time, so no real big change in the quarter. As it relates to our capital markets business fees, listen, Q1 was a really solid quarter for us, particularly given the backdrop, $230 million of revenue. Q1 tends to be historically a lighter quarter, and frankly, as we came into the quarter looking at pipelines, I think we thought we'd be a little bit shy of that number. As we look at Q2, especially with the backdrop that we have, lower deal flow out there, we've got a very solid pipeline. Does that shape up to be similar revenue numbers Q1? Not sure. We might be a little bit shy of that, but given the environment, feel really good about that pipeline. Back half of the year, we're going to need to see. Let's see how the environment plays out, how the capital markets shape up. But as we sit here May 1st of 2025, when we look at Q1, look at our forward pipeline, feel better about it than we felt May 1st of 2024. Now, we had a big back half of the year in 2024. We'll see how the rest of 2025 shakes out, but we feel really good with how our business continues to be able to perform in different market environments. You look at 2022 and 2023, we generated roughly $600 million of revenue in both of those years, so really protected downside in that business, created more of a floor from a revenue perspective in very choppy capital markets environments. And then, you saw a spike to roughly $1 billion of revenue when the markets opened up in 2024. Team has done an awesome job building that business over the last almost two decades, so I think there's a lot of upside from here.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Glenn Schorr: Hi, there. So, I want to circle back to the conversation on private equity. You clearly helped us see how the linear deployment and investment pacing helps your particular situation, especially when we look at even America's 12 and the capital you've returned. So, the question is broader, do you expect -- in 2006, 2007 and 2008 vintages, that was kind of subpar performance for the industry? People thought private equity was dead. We go out and we've raised a lot of money. It doubles and triples. So, the question is, is this time any different for the industry? There's more funds. There's more assets raised. There's subpar performance. Are we going to see a bigger shakeout, because we didn't see enough of one in past downturns? So, the real question at the end of all that is, will we see lower allocations to private equity or just a dispersion and consolidation to the better performance?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Glenn, it's Scott. It's a great question. Our expectation is that it'll probably be more about where you ended up. It'll be more about dispersion. And I think you're going to have meaningful dispersion of results across private equity managers. And that will start to come through maybe in a way that it hasn't to your point for a very long time. We've already seen a trend for a while of institutional investors in particular globally wanting to do more with fewer. And so, they've been consolidating their relationships with people that they think can perform through a cycle and that in a lot of cases are global and multi-asset class. Obviously, we've benefited from that. So, I think it's going to be, I wouldn't use the term shakeout. I think there'll be more of a concentration of capital with fewer players. And I think we'll now see the benefit of what I mentioned before, that we learned a lot during GFC, during COVID, during Trump 1.0. We've been applying those learnings. Volatility creates opportunity. But you need to have the capital to invest and the courage to invest it. And we as a firm, and we talk about culture all the time here, we're incredibly well-connected. And if nothing else, we learn. And so, hopefully that will benefit us as it comes through results. But I think it's going to be dispersion as opposed to shakeout.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Chubak: Hi, good morning.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Robert Lewin: Good morning.
Steve Chubak: So, I recognize that you're planning to give a more fulsome update on the capital partnership in the second-half. But I was hoping you could just provide some early color on distribution strategy, and specifically areas of differentiation versus other competing products, and just how these vehicles might evolve over time?
Craig Larson: Hey, Steve. This is Craig. Why don't I start? Look, we are obviously at the earliest of days. We are really excited with gaining position to launch the two vehicles, you would have seen in the press release, from a couple of days ago that there is more to come with the private equity-focused product in addition to real assets yield-oriented products. And alongside of that, there are initiatives focused on things like model portfolios, as well as target date funds. So, we're just, again, at the earliest of days, and we were preparing for the question of what do we think it looks like. And that is, Steve, a super tough question to answer, because in many ways it feels like, together we both are forging a new path, a very exciting path, and we will keep everybody addressed in terms of progress as we go forward., But our mindset, as you've heard from us over time is not on new capital raised in a three, six to 12-month period. We together are trying to design products that we think, five, 10, 15 years from now. Collectively, we are both going to look back at, and feel really proud about the net investment performance that we delivered on behalf of our clients. And if we are successful in that part of the equation, we are going to be able to raise just a fine amount of money. So, again, there is a lot of excitement within our firm, I think, within Capital Group as well, about the opportunity. And it just feels great at this point to be launched and underway.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Steve. This is Scott. I think, Craig said it well. We talked about the private wealth opportunity for a while. We do think that it is significant. As you know, a lot of institutions globally are 30% to 50%. In alternatives, individual investors are low single-digits, depending on when you look at 1% or 2%. So, the opportunity for expanding our market is meaningful. But even more importantly for that, it just doesn't make sense that if you are a teacher in Texas, and you retired, you have 30%, 40% of your retirement funds invested in alternatives. And if you are a retired dentist, you have zero. You haven't had access to what we do. And so, with K-Series, we have been focused on hitting the accredited investor. And I'll talk you about U.S. market for a minute. That's a million of net worth. And that is about 5%. Anyway, you look at 5% to 7% of U.S. households. And as you know, we have launched there. And we are underway, as with some of the number Craig walked through before. With Capital Group, we're focused on the other 95%. And we have just launched these first two products in credit space, but what's coming, private equity, real estate, infrastructure, models, and figuring out how to access more efficiently the broader investor universe, and target fee. What can we do in for 1k? So, there is a lot more coming attractions, and there is work done to-date. And we think the opportunity is immense. But our focus to be super clear is investment performance that we generate for the client. And just like we have been for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, and family offices for nearly 50 years. That remains our focus, and figuring out how to deliver that performance to that new audience with a fantastic partner.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mike Brown: Hi. Good morning, Scott, Rob, and Craig.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Mike Brown: I wanted to ask on the flagship fundraising in 2025. So, you had the first close on North America buyout. It seems like the industry-wide fundraising is elongated. So, I wanted to ask what's the right timeframe to consider for a final close? And then, beyond North America buyout, where else you're expecting the enclosing of big flagships in 2025? I believe, Asia is starting, so can we see some inflows in '25? And then, what's the expected timing on the final close for infra fundraising? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Mike. This is Craig. Why don't I start? First on infra and flagship infra fundraising at 331, we are a little over $11 billion -- $11.3 billion, as you can see in the back of the release. I think we feel really good about progress to date. I think to your point, if anything, we may be seeing a little bit more of a barbelled approach to fundraising in this environment. So, the biggest components of capital coming in either at the initial close to take advantage of first-close discounts or the final close. I think that's probably always been the case. But perhaps feels maybe even a little more so in the current environment. Again, as it relates to Americas private equity, wrapped up the first close at 14, as Rob alluded to in the prepare remarks, just feel really great about progress to date. And I think it's a real credit to the team as we look at absolute returns and capital return and all the things that we've already talked about. We'd expect, we'll have a couple of closes in America. And we'll launch fundraising for the flagship Asia strategy on the heels of that. We haven't announced publicly any specific timing as it relates to when we would launch that fundraising. But I think that is a topic that is certainly becoming front of mind for us here. And then, similarly, we haven't announced a final close date on Infra V. Our first close period ended or was in July of 24. So, we're well inside of 12 months at this point. And. We'll keep you abreast as we move forward there. But again, we just haven't announced any specific closing date on Infra V. I think the broader point just relates to the breadth of activity that you see for us, because on the one hand, there's always -- and we understand it, given the size of these vehicles, there's always a big focus on the flagship activity. But if you look at that activity for us, and if that's been $20 billion or so in the trailing 12 months, probably a little north of that, that still means you've got $80 billion to $90 billion outside of that activity that you're seeing across the breadth of our platform. Lots of activity across the credit business, I think similarly, broadly across infrastructure, even we've launched fundraising for Asia infrastructure, the various wealth platforms, climate, et cetera. So, there's just an underlying breadth of activity that gives us comfort.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add, Mike, is just to underscore Craig's last point, we talked about the durability and diversity of the model. We've been very focused on this for the last 10-15 years. So, flagships obviously remain very important. But LTM, just over 20% of the capital we've raised. In the last two years, we've raised over $200 billion of capital just over -- and it's been about 12% of that $200 billion. So, just to give you a sense of the diversity of the fundraising channels that we have and all the different ways we can access capital, meaningfully different than how we looked and felt a decade ago.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on just fundraising and was hoping, obviously momentum is quite strong -- was hoping you could just talk about your conversations you're having with LPs? And generally, the health of that client base on the institutional side as you think -- in the heels of this kind of volatile market we've been in?
Scott Nuttall: Great. Thanks, Dan; Scott. Let me take a shot at it. So, we have had, as you'd expect, significant engagement with our clients the last several weeks. We tend to lean in even more when the world's uncertain and have even more connectivity. It's hard to paint everybody with one brush, but people are in healthy shape overall. So, the characteristics of the dialogue, one, it's super early. So, everybody's just processing all of this. What's it mean? How do I think about it? What are we seeing around the world? So, we're sharing that with everybody that we work for. And there's confusion on what this means. What it means in different places and where we end up. So, a lot of the discussions are on macro, policy implications, geopolitics. But the clients overall are liquid. And they're asking us, where should I lean in to take advantage of this for the most part? I think a number of them probably wish they'd invested more aggressively post COVID and post the GFC. So, they don't want to make the same mistake. So, we're getting questions about traded and opportunistic credit as an example. So, I'd characterize it on balance. Of course, some people are more concerned than others. But I'd characterize it as cautious greed and not wanting to look back with regret again. Now I say all this and I mentioned it's changing very quickly. The S&P is now down 1% since April 1st. And I haven't looked at where we're trading since our call started. And down 5%, so this is as of last night, since the beginning of the year. And credit spreads, which were very tight, had moved back maybe to the averages. We hadn't seen them blow out materially. So, people are liquid, and I think overall are trying to figure out how to take advantage of this. The other question we get is, how do I think about where to invest my money? A number of folks, as I mentioned before, had been thinking about, if they were 60% to 70% U.S., should I be even more on the forward? That was January, February. Now it's more kind of retrenching. Maybe I've got it about right. Do I need to rethink it? And people are just trying to figure out what all this means. But in the final analysis, the U.S. is 25% of global GDP and 65% of global market cap. So, said another way, U.S. equity market is two times the size of Europe, Japan, and India combined. So, as we talk to CIOs, CEOs around the world that are allocating capital, there's a recognition of that fact and the depth and liquidity of this market. And so, we haven't seen anybody make any abrupt changes, but it's super early. So, I'd say highly constructive discussions and business as usual, plus a lot more engagement.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Patrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. My question is on the insurance discussion. I think you said you expect it to stay in the 250 million range for the next few quarters, but with the ongoing portfolio repositioning, and now I would think potential for wider new investment spreads, why is there not room for that to tick up through the year? Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Yes, thanks a lot for the question, Patrick. There's a few different things going on. So, let me just start with how we look at things, and then I'll work towards your specific question. And we really do focus on that all-in ROE concept. Today, we are approaching that 20% level, so pretty attractive in its own right. And we've got a clear path to sustainably beating that level to generate 20 plus percent all-in ROEs especially we get all elements of the business model working together. And I'd point out that we're achieving that return level while we're going through this evolution of our business model at GA, which we know is going to put some near-term pressure on insurance segment operating earnings for a bit of time, all with the benefit of the longer-term economic profile that we think we can achieve. We know for us that that's unquestionably the right path to take. And I think you've followed us for some time, others on the call have, I'm sure as well. You know, that we're always going to make the decision to side for long-term economics, even at the expense of short-term P&L. Now, going into a little bit more of the detail that will answer your question more specifically, we're working on a few different initiatives simultaneously, like all with good momentum. So, let me give you a few different data points. This all starts, how we evolve the business model modestly here, all starts with elongating our liabilities. And if you look at Q1 of this year, in the retail channel, 90% of the annuities that we went out and sold, and then the liabilities that we raised had a duration of five plus years attached to them. If you go look at this time last year, that number was 65%. So, really good progress on that important front. Number two, we've talked about taking our exposure to alternatives up. Industry average tends to be 5% to 8% exposure to alternatives. Global Atlantic, we mentioned at the end of last quarter, was 1%. In the quarter, we added roughly a billion dollars of alternatives exposure. So, making progress there too. And then, importantly, the third-party capital is a very significant part of our strategy going forward. I referenced in the prepared remarks, some of the momentum that we have there, the Japan post-strategic partnership, we're out-raising IB3 right now. And so, there's a lot going on as it relates to third-party capital as well. So, good progress across these three very important initiatives, but to answer your question specifically, this is all going to take a little bit of time to impact the P&L, and especially the part around the alternatives book and the growing alternatives book. Remember, much of that doesn't come through in yield. In addition to that, as we grow our third-party capital base, big part of our go-forward strategy, those fees only turn on when the capital is invested. Again, it will take a bit of time. So, we think where this all lands is a very attractive run rate return inside the insurance business. I think importantly, with lower leverage over time. And then, with significant asset management economics, alongside that takes that all-in ROE to that sustainable 20 plus percent level that I referenced earlier. I hope that's helpful color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please go ahead.
Arnaud Giblat: Yes, good morning. So, we've seen a large number or a certain number of large deals that would have been financed through the broad syndicated loan market or for private debt in April. I think Cairo is an example here. So, I was wondering how the availability of bank debt is currently evolving as we've seen spreads tighten once again. I'm asking the question from two angles, really. So, number one is what is the availability to do deals, the availability of debt and how that is evolving in April given the spreads tightening once again. And second, also looking through the lens of KKR as a provider of private debt, is there an opportunity to take back market share from the banks here? Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks, Arnaud. It's Rob. Why don't I start? Listen, I think when you saw very early April, you saw a brief dislocation where it was for a small period of time, hard to go secure bank financing. I think, we talk a lot about our capital markets business as a fee generator for KKR and a profitability generator. And of course, it has been. But the whole reason that business started was to really be able to support our portfolio companies in a differentiated way. And we saw that in Cairo where we went out and arranged our own financing. As it relates to where we sit today, we see bank availability of capital. The leverage finance market is open, albeit, I think it's, in order to access it, spreads are a little bit higher for sure today than where they were, but it's open and available for new deals sitting here in early May. Private credit opportunity remains a robust one as well. And given the backup and spreads in the leverage finance market, little bit slower activity, of course, in the CLO formation market, we think that the spread opportunity in our private credit and direct lending business is one that's attractive as we head into Q2 here as well.
Scott Nuttall: Arnaud, it's Scott, I think the capital is available to do deals. Depending on the transaction, I'd say the more straightforward stories that high line of sight to syndicatability, those are going the leverage credit bank route. Those with maybe more of a story attached can go the private credit route, that capital is available. The key for us is those markets exist and function side by side. So, it presents an option for us as we think about the best way to go depending on the transaction. As in the private credit space, that capital tends to be locked up and it's readily available. So, it's more about the cost, as Rob said, and what's the best path based on the story and the underlying. I do think you're going to continue to see as banks periodically pull back, if volatility increases, then you'll see private credit take more share from leverage credit or the syndicated market, and then it'll cut back the other way. This is an environment where we've got a little bit of both going on.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most have been asked and answered, but one, maybe one on FRE margin, continues to be impressive, growth in the FRE margin. So, just a question for Rob, I've asked this before in prior calls, but just to ask it again, do you see any kind of ceiling in that, it was basically the view of investing more, I guess, if the fee revenue growth improves, and then should we be thinking about higher expenses around distribution costs for your capital partnership as that evolves as maybe being a potential headwind on margin?
Robert Lewin: Great, thanks a lot, Brian. So, a few different things as I try and address your question, maybe just start on the expense side. We have talked about continuing to want to invest back into our business for growth. As an example, we've talked about placement fees and distribution costs. And from my seat, that is the best cost we have because it's got the clearest ROI attached to it. Now, even with that said, what I've also talked about in the past as it relates to margin. So, I think we can operate in a sustainable way at that mid-60% FRE margin, but the past number of quarters, as we've been close to the high 60% level. And I don't think either is a cap for us. I know it's not a cap for us, because if you go back to our business strategy, from our perspective, this all about scaling things that we have already started. And if we're successful at executing on that business strategy, and as a leadership team, we've got a lot of confidence that we're going to be. Then we're going to grow our revenue at a pace that meaningfully exceeds our headcount growth and the operating complexity across the firm. And so, while FRE margin expansion or overall margin expansion isn't an input to our business strategy, it is a really nice output to our strategy if we get it right, and we think we will.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on tariffs, I think you had referenced about 10% of your AUM that has some sort of first order impact, sounds like that's mostly in credit. Is that fair? Can you just elaborate a bit on how you see restrictive trade policy impacting the portfolio? I think you also mentioned you're taking some mitigation steps. Maybe you can elaborate on the mitigation action steps you guys are taking. And then, could you also speak to any sort of second or third order impacts that you're thinking about? How are you going about assessing that? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Yes, thanks, Mike. Let me start. When I referenced the 90% number, that was a private equity number across our portfolio where we're looking across our Global PE business and feel like in 90% of the outcomes on an AUM basis that there's no material exposure. As you think about that other 10%, that doesn't include any mitigation strategies that are, of course, already well underway. And so, we feel really well positioned. Infrastructure, we feel equally well positioned. When we look at that portfolio, much of what we do as contractual protections that insulate KKR returns are just no exposure at all. And then, on the credit side of our business, actually, as we understand the tariffs today, we think there might be even less exposure than what we're seeing in our private equity portfolio today. And so, we feel as we look across our $600 plus billion of AUM, really well situated. It's not to say we're not going to have our issues. And as you think about potential second or third order impacts and potential impacts across the economy, whether that's GDP or inflation or interest rates, of course, we're very attuned to that. We believe we're in a very fortunate position to have invested meaningfully behind a macro function, a geopolitics function, public policy, all of those teams deeply embedded across our investment teams globally. And really synced up in a way that we're trying to anticipate what could happen next and be in a position where we can really react to things either proactively or very quickly if things change from our base case. So, there's a lot going on in the macro side. Again, we feel very well, competitively well positioned, given our resources and the connectivity across our firm.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Mike, it's Scott. I'd say this is obviously not an accident. I mentioned before, we learned a lot during COVID and 1.0 Trump. And so, we've been focused on acquiring assets and companies that have again more durable demand drivers. So, one of the things that we've been looking at is do we think companies can hold margins in a high cost or higher inflation environment? And we frankly have been leaning into those parts of the global economy and away from those that the answer is not as good. And so, as Rob said, I'm sure we're going to get surprised by some things, but as we look at it today, really where we are today and what Rob just walked through is a result of the last five plus years of investing through that prism. Look, if we have a broader consumer led recession in the United States or there's some other larger dislocation, then I'm sure you're going to have other work to be done. We also think we have management teams that are well equipped. And again, having gone through COVID with a large part of this portfolio, we've already had good practice as to how to get ready for a more dislocated environment. So, we think we're well tested, but time will tell.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just a blended follow-up question on insurance and capital markets, Rob, just to clarify your earlier comments, should investors move away from thinking about insurance earnings being at the 14% to 15% pre-tax ROE range over the long run, and instead simply think about an all-in type 20% plus target instead? And secondly, in the prepared remarks, you reiterated the opportunity to substantially grow the capital markets fees that are tied to insurance versus the $50 million level in 2024. can you just give us an update on the roadmap to get to the several hundred million level you noted? And how you are thinking about a timeframe to achieve that?
Scott Nuttall: Okay. Thanks, Kyle. Short answer is, no, as it relates to the insurance operating earnings, and moving away from that. And of course how we go maximize profitability inside our insurance business, and how we go operate on behalf of our annuity holders, is a very important consideration. I think, as we are trying to frame the insurance business at KKR, I think it's important to look holistically, which is really how we as a management team think about it. And so, that insurance operating earnings, it is importantly the third-party capital fees from IV, our capital markets business, in addition to, of course, our investment management agreement that exist between our asset management and our insurance business. And so, I think both are very important. But holistically as a management team, we do look at that all in ROE, and we thought it was important to share on this call, because to be generating a high-teens approaching 20% all in ROE, at the same time, we are evolving our business model, and really under earning in the near-term inside of the four walls of insurance, I think, speaks to the opportunity that we have once we get all of them into our business model working really well together. As it relates to your second part of your question on the opportunity for capital markets fees, we've got a dear friend that's done a really awesome job building that part of the business into something that contributes a significant amount of revenue as we look at how our capital markets business is situated. The investments that we've made in structured products and private investment grade, the resources that we have on the ground, and distribution, we feel really great about continuing to build that business, and to achieve very substantial revenue outcomes for our shareholders. If you look at across all of 2024, we are roughly $50 million fees in that part of our business. In Q1 of this year, that number was about $20 million. And so, like most things here, Kyle, we are not in a rush. We are very conscious to get in the right way, and in a way that maximizes the long-term opportunity. And we continue to believe that generating hundreds of millions of revenue on the back of this type of opportunity is certainly well within achievability from our perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Ben Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi. Thank you for taking my follow-up. I wanted to ask about one more kind of forward-looking commentary in the last quarter. In terms of management fee growth, Rob, last quarter, you suggested that we should see some acceleration from the 14% growth in 2024. Just curious if that's still the case? And maybe as part of that, I know perhaps you can't say when the America's fund might activate, but could you remind us what are the sort of constraints just depended on making the first investment, or the pace of deployment of predecessor what should we look for there? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. We continue to believe that management fees will accelerate from here, off to this level. Keep in mind that much of the $31 billion of capital that we raised is showing up in management fees. We've got $64 billion at the AUM, where the fees have not yet turned on with the weighted average management of roughly 100 basis points, so, a lot of visibility around where our future growth is going to come from. I can't tell you that next four will be activated in Q2 of 2025. So, in this current quarter we are in right now, and so, will be a partial benefit to the Q2 quarter. And we've got a lot of other, I think, momentum across our capital raising channels that we touched on through this discussion. So, we continue to believe management fees will accelerate from here.
Operator: Thank you. As there are no fourth questions, I'd now like to hand the conference call to Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson: [Seiko] (ph), thank you for your help this morning, and thank you everybody for attention. I know this has been a longer call, during a very volatile environment. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to giving everybody another broad update in 90 days. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So beginning with our financial results we had a really solid end to the year. Fee related earnings per share came in at $0.94, that is up 24% from a year ago and is the second highest quarterly figure in our history and adjusted net income came in at $1.32 per share. That is up 32% year-over-year and is also the second highest quarterly figure in our history. For the year, FRE per share and ANI per share were $3.66 and $4.70, up 37% and 38% respectively compared to 2023 and both are record annual figures for us. So very healthy growth during a period of time where it is felt to us as the market conditions have just begun to improve. Walking through our quarterly results in a little more detail, management fees in Q4 came in at $906 million, that's up 15% year-over-year driven by the breadth of our fundraising activities alongside of a pickup in deployment. Total transaction and monitoring fees were $324 million in the quarter. Capital markets transaction fees in particular ended the year on a strong note with $270 million in revenue driven primarily by deployment activity within private equity as well as infrastructure. Fee related performance revenues were $25 million in the quarter and so in aggregate fee related revenues were $1.3 billion and that's up 17% year-over-year. Turning to expenses, as usual, fee related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 17.5% of fee related revenues for the quarter as well as for the year. Other operating expenses were $192 million in Q4, so in total fee related earnings were $843 million [ph] or $0.94 per share as I mentioned a minute ago, with an FRE margin of 67%. Insurance operating earnings were $250 million and Strategic Holdings operating earnings were $8 million. Both of these figures came in right in line with the levels we discussed on our call last quarter. Total operating earnings as a reminder comprised of our fee related earnings, insurance and Strategic Holdings operating earnings were $1.23 per share. So total operating earnings for KKR, again these are the more durable and recurring components of our earnings, comprised almost 80% of total segment earnings for the year. Moving to investing earnings within our asset management segment, realized performance income were $676 million and realized investment income was $110 million for total monetization activity of $786 million. That's up almost 50% year-over-year. This activity was driven by combination of secondary sales and strategic transactions, dividends and interest income, as well as the annual performance fee for Marshall Waste. So in total investing earnings were $399 million. Turning to investment performance, you can see the details here on Page 10 of our earnings release. The private equity portfolio was flat in the quarter and appreciated 14% for the year. In real assets, the opportunistic real estate portfolio is up 1 in the quarter and 4 for the year, infrastructure up 2 for the quarter and up 14% for the year. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite and the alternative credit composite were both up 2% in Q4 and for the year, performance here was up 10% and up 12% respectively. And then finally, consistent with our historical practice, we intend to increase our annual dividend from $0.70 to $0.74 per share, which will go into effect alongside first quarter 2025 earnings. And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot Craig and thank you all for joining our call this morning. KKR had a strong 2024 and our fourth quarter results that Craig just walked through give us continued confidence as we head into 2025. I'm going to begin today by reviewing some key operating metrics from the quarter and the very tangible signs of momentum that we are seeing across our businesses. Let me start first with our asset management business. As it relates to our capital raising efforts, we raised $27 billion this quarter, which was driven by diversified activity across each of our business lines. Our private equity and real asset businesses together raised $15 billion of capital across a number of strategies and momentum in credit continued across our asset based finance and direct lending vehicles and we also saw an uptick in CLO formation. Total new capital raised for 2024 is $114 billion. That is the second most active year in our history and up meaningfully from the approximately $70 billion that we raised in 2023. While we are only six months into our fundraising super cycle, we are seeing meaningful progress. In our North America private equity strategy where we are in early stage fundraising, we are ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time. Our efforts here are benefiting from really strong investment performance. Also of note, 2024 was the eighth consecutive year that we've returned more capital to our North American private equity clients than we have called. And alongside the encouraging first steps in our flagship fundraising within private equity and infrastructure, we continue to raise capital across the breadth of our asset classes and vehicles. Taking a step back, over the past 12 months, only 15% of our $114 billion of new capital raised was from our flagship funds. Client interest feels strong in areas like private credit, including asset based finance in particular, our Ivy sidecar franchise and insurance, as well as in newer strategies for us such as climate. Turning to wealth, we are seeing continued scaling with AUM across our K-Series vehicles at $16 billion as of yearend and including activity that closed January 1, 2025, we are now at $18 billion, which compares to $7 billion just a year ago. Looking more broadly, we now have approximately $100 billion of assets under management from individuals, largely via family offices and ultrahigh net worth clients as well as the accredited investor universe. And looking ahead, we expect our reach will expand to a new client base as we continue to track towards the launch of our two hybrid credit products in the first half of 2025. These are developed exclusively in partnership with Kappa Group, targeting the mass affluent. At the same time, we continue to work on product design across other asset classes which will follow over the coming several quarters. So we feel good about where we are from a private wealth perspective and we really do believe that this is just the beginning for us. Turning now to monetizations, over the past couple of quarters we've been noting signs of an improved backdrop with increased M&A volumes and firmer global equity and debt markets. This strength is evidenced in our 2024 gross realized performance income and realized investment income figures of $1.8 billion and over $600 million respectively. Overall, our monetization activity is up over 40% year-on-year. And now looking at deployment, in 2024 we invested $84 billion of capital. That's up meaningfully from $44 billion in 2023 and compared to $71 billion in 2022. This was driven by a significant ramp in credit along with a rebound across many of our private market strategies. As we head into a more constructive environment, we do feel very well positioned as a result of the current activity levels, especially in relation to deployment. Our capital markets business saw another strong revenue quarter at $270 million, bringing the 2024 total to $1 billion for the first time in our history. This is a major milestone in the evolution of the business and it was only just four years ago when this business was roughly half the size and largely private equity driven. Now turning to insurance, 2024 marked the first year that we've owned 100% of Global Atlantic and the connectivity between KKR and GA only increased over the course of the year. You've seen investment opportunities for GA increase in strategies like infrastructure and real estate equities. And as our businesses continued to integrate, we see even more opportunities to invest strategically against the long dated liabilities that Global Atlantic is able to source at scale. And finally focusing on Strategic Holdings for a minute, our Strategic Holdings business represents a big differentiator for us and the announcement this morning is a further accelerant of this segment. We will be increasing the existing stakes of three businesses that we know well and really like by at least $2.1 billion. KKR will invest $1.1 billion which will show up in Strategic Holdings, while the remainder will be from one of our strategic partners. This piece will become fee paying asset under management and will be additive to management fees and future carried interest. As a reminder, these businesses have high quality management teams. They are cash generative, tend to be less cyclical and typically have lower leverage over the hold period, to name just a few of the key attributes. In other words, these are businesses that we want to own for the long-term. Today we have 18 companies that we've invested behind over the course of the last eight years and we're continuing to see consistent growth across the underlying franchises. For context, KKR's share of these businesses as of the third quarter, so this is on a one quarter lag basis, generated approximately $3.7 billion of revenue and approximately $900 million of EBITDA over the trailing 12 months. We believe Strategic Holdings will be a truly unique driver of future financial performance for KKR for years to come. Remember, no employees sit within Strategic Holdings. We didn't have to hire anybody new to lean into this growth opportunity, which aligns really well with our focus on preserving our collaborative one firm culture. And with these additional purchases alongside continued strong performance across our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for Strategic Holdings operating earnings that we introduced roughly a year ago by $50 million in 2026 to $350 plus million and by $100 million in each of 2028 and 2030 to $700 plus million and $1.1 plus billion respectively. I don't believe that there are many corporates that give guidance out to 2030. Hopefully this gives you a very clear sense of our confidence in the outlook, durability and the growth trajectory for our business. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks Rob. Given this is our year end call, I want to spend a few minutes sharing how it feels inside the firm. And forgive the analogy, but I'm a runner and this is how I think about it. The punch line is that despite all the progress you've seen and the progression of the numbers Craig and Rob just took you through, we have not been running at full pace the last couple years. Said another way, we are not yet operating at our true potential, but it does feel like we're picking up speed on multiple fronts. What do I mean by that? Well, let's go back for a minute to the last two years so you have some context for 2025 and we'll start with 2023. In asset management in 2023, buyers and sellers were far apart. Owners of assets, including ourselves, did not want to sell or finance assets in a dislocated market. So deployment, monetizations and fundraising were more muted. Capital markets were closed for large portions of the year. There was more fear than greed in the market, and private wealth was just launching for us. At Global Atlantic, we were at approximately 63% ownership. We were not utilizing all of KKR and we were still figuring out what was possible. And in Strategic Holdings, the portfolio was still maturing and generating little cash earnings for the firm and we were still working on the vision of what it could be. So in short, we were running uphill in bad weather, on rough terrain, in new gear. Now let's go to 2024. In asset management the market began to open in the first half of last year and buyers and sellers started finding each other again. It usually takes some time for the M&A market to turn back on, and that's what we saw in the first half, the market was gearing back up. But then the election distraction slowed things down again in the back half. But we didn't see a full year of normalcy and it felt a bit on/off. Private wealth was still ramping for us with more hiring and the team getting embedded, while we were being added to many more platforms, but nowhere near what's possible. And you saw only the first steps in our fundraising super cycle. So overall, as you heard, deployment and monetizations and fundraising were all up materially last year, but not what it could be in a full year hospitable market. In Global Atlantic, we got to 100% ownership at the beginning of last year and then we spent the year sorting out how to use all of KKR and all of GA truly together on an integrated basis. It was a learning year. And in Strategic Holdings, we explained to the market what we are doing at our Investor Day in April and continue to focus on how to scale dividend flow faster and portfolio optimize. And throughout the year, it became clear the earnings and dividend compounding opportunity was even greater than we expected, but it was early. The 2024 was a good year, not a great year. We executed reasonably well, but we were still running uphill with intermittent rain after some sun and we were learning how to use our new gear. But to be clear, overall conditions were much better than 2023 and we got smarter about how to use the model we've built. So let's talk about how it feels now heading into 2025 and 2026. In asset management pipelines are up, more exits are possible and we see more deployment opportunities globally and across asset classes. Exits should see fundraising momentum even more at the exact time we're in the market with a number of our flagship funds. Private wealth is showing real progress and we are seeing flows increase and broaden globally and across platforms. And our Capital Group partnership is expected to launch soon in credit with other asset classes to follow. We expect this partnership to be significant for us. At Global Atlantic, we're much smarter now after a year of owning 100%. We are shifting our strategy to emphasize longer duration, more private markets, assets, more global and more integration across operational areas. We're starting to capture the opportunities we see in capital markets in Asia, just two examples. And we see a path to fully use the power of the combined model and what that could mean. There's more opportunity than we thought. And in Strategic Holdings, we can really see the potential of what this could be. Today's announcement is just a start. The dividend scaling and compounding opportunity is real. So where are we now? The sun is out and we're running on flat road. The conditions and forecasts are good. We're comfortable in our new gear. We're stronger for the last two years of hard work and we're picking up speed. Conditions could of course change, which would impact some of this, political, geopolitical, inflation rates, to name just a few. But remember, KKR's business model is different. That's on purpose. The combination of asset management plus insurance plus Strategic Holdings creates a model with a massive addressable market, significant recurring earnings and the opportunity to grow with few additional people at KKR, preserving culture and enhancing our ability to perform for clients and further increase our margins. So we're optimistic, still out there running and happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. Our question is on the investing outlook across the firm. So the consensus outlook for 2025 was always stronger, but the macros become a little bit more challenging versus 90 days ago. You can see this in the 10-year and in the VIX [ph]. So sitting here today in January, what is the investment outlook for 2025 relative to last year and what has been the sensitivity to some of the macro trends that have developed?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Craig, it's Scott. Let me start off with that one. Our view has not changed and I think when we were talking at the end of last year, I think the perspective was heading into 2025, you'd see an improved M&A environment. A lot of the transactions that maybe didn't get done in 2023 and then maybe got put on hold in late 2024 would come back to the market. That is still very much our expectation that you're going to see the M&A market pick up this year. We expect there's going to be a lot of noise, no doubt. But as we look through the noise and try to figure out the signal, there's nothing that we're seeing that changes that perspective as we sit here today. And remember, for us, volatility creates opportunities. We are expecting there will be some volatility, but we think that will make the investment environment even more interesting for us and so we remain optimistic as you've heard in the prepared remarks, no change. And I think remember how global our business is. So a lot of the opportunities we see are not just in the U.S. but around the world. But you know, if you think about what we're telling you, we expect more investing, more monetizations and more fundraising. And so the punch line to kind of keep everybody keeping their eye on the ball really hasn't changed for us.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe follow up on Craig's question thinking about the 2025 outlook. Maybe to just start, could you give a little bit of an update on the Americas fundraise, but in terms of 2025, just maybe tying that into how should we think about sort of the trajectory of management fee growth into the year? There's obviously some dynamics with catch up fees, timing of fund activations, but curious on those two items, the Americas Fund and how we should think about broader 2025 management fee growth? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey Ben, it's Craig. Why don't I start? I'm sure Rob will pick up on the management fee trend. Thanks for asking about America's private equity. That, as you know, is a front burner topic for us. As Rob had noted, we did take some capital prior to year end and without getting into the details as a first close period is still ongoing as Rob noted, we're definitely ahead of where we thought we'd be, which has been really encouraging. And we do expect to be wrapped up with a first close in Q1 here, so you should expect more news here shortly, so good news, good progress to date with more to come.
Robert Lewin: Ben, I'll pick up on the management fee side. As you know, management fee growth has been a real area of relative strength for us. If you look back over the past three years, we've grown our management fees at a CAGR of 19%. We were up 14% in 2024 and as we look forward, we can see some acceleration in management fee growth off of that level. We've got a lot of good things, as Scott noted, happening across our business right now. Current expectation is that America's Bio Fund plus or minus will turn on midpoint of the year. But there's lots of other real signs of tangible management fee growth. And as you take maybe a further step back and you look at our $4.50 plus per share FRE target in 2026, it's obviously a target we've got a lot of confidence in being able to hit. In order to achieve that, we're going to need to drive real execution around management fee growth from here. We feel like we're well positioned to be able to do that, but still a lot to get done.
Benjamin Budish: All right, great. Thank you so much.
Robert Lewin: Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Blostein: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I was hoping that we could go back to the Strategic Holdings announcements, obviously an important stuff for you guys. Could you just maybe walk us through sort of why now? Why is now the right time to add? When you're looking across the 18 portfolio companies that you have, what is the percentage that KKR owns today on balance sheet and I guess what percentage of any portfolio company would you feel comfortable owning over time?
Craig Larson: Thanks, Alex. Why don't I start? So to answer maybe the last part of your question first, Strategic Holdings owns roughly directly 20% of the core private equity businesses, now that will vary from business to business as a whole, roughly 20%. Listen, we've articulated that we view Strategic Holdings as a real differentiator for our business model. It is on top of asset management and insurance. And we've talked often about how we believe capital allocation can drive incremental long-term accretion to our recurring earnings per share. And so we saw an opportunity to buy a larger stake in three businesses that we know really well, that we believed would be really accretive to our long-term earnings per share growth and we're excited to be able to do that.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Alex. This is Scott. I'll just add on just as a reminder at least what's in Strategic Holdings today is the balance sheet exposure to our core private equity business and so that to answer your first question, we're roughly a third of that capital on the whole across that platform. When you look at the last partnership that we created there we had some two partners. This incremental investment we're making, one of our partners, Chubb, the large insurance company is going to be investing alongside of us. And so we'll be half of the capital in this add on as Rob mentioned in the prepared remarks. And in terms of the timing, there's nothing magic about it. We feel great about these companies. They continue to mature. They're getting that much closer to paying meaningful dividends and already are in a couple of the instances. And so as the portfolio matures and we look at the opportunity to continue to scale, what Strategic Holdings can be, it felt like a good time. We had some partners that were looking to get liquidity and so it lined up nicely for us.
Alexander Blostein: Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Katz: Okay, thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could maybe double click into the wealth management opportunity. You spoke very constructively about the outlook from here. Just sort of wondering where you sort of see the greatest opportunity. I know it's a fairly in-depth question just from a multi vector perspective a product or a geography or distribution channel. And I was wondering if you could tie that to your outlook for the other expense line as we should think about further scaling of the platform. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Bill, it's Craig. Why don't I start? I'm sure Scott will add then on Capital Group. So just taking a step back in level setting for everyone, as of 12/31 we had about $100 billion of AUM from individuals. And that number, just to be clear does not include policyholders at Global Atlantic. So if anything that figure is understated as you think about the breadth of our presence and activities with individuals, the largest part of that and probably the most mature would be capital that we have from high net worth and ultrahigh net worth individuals, family offices that have invested in our funds over time. One of the pieces that is growing significantly and where we still see lots of room for growth relates to the K-Series products. And again just for everybody, these are funds and strategies that are designed and tailored specifically for wealth investors and the accredited investor as well as qualified purchasers. And so over $100 billion, as Rob noted, 16 are from the K-Series products as of 12/31 and that 16 goes up to 18 if you include the January subscriptions. So just in terms of K-Series, a couple of thoughts. First, again that 18 a year ago compares to 7, so early days but we feel really good about our progress. I think that is true in particular in infrastructure as well as in private equity which are newer asset classes for many of these investors. In total we raised over $8 billion last year for infra in PE and have led, have leading market share in both of those asset classes. And again it's tough to draw broad conclusions from really short periods of time. But in January we raised again over a billion dollars, the strongest fundraising month for us in both private equity well as infrastructure. And in terms of the numbers in total, we did launch our private BDC more recently, much younger in its seasoning and more growth and presence. And so I think that the K-Series growth opportunity is one that's significant and even taking a step back mass affluent investors. It's not been easy for them to access alternatives historically and we do believe over the coming years, there continues to be lots of opportunities for us to grow, build and scale we think, given our brand, our track record, the investments we've made in distribution and marketing, there's lots of near-term opportunities for us in terms of these strategies, longer-term opportunities as we think, again, out in the long-term about retirement and 401(k). And then another piece of that is a strategic partnership with Capital Group, and I'll let Scott touch on that.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Bill, more broadly, I think part of the reason you're hearing such optimism in our belief is it does feel like we're just getting started here, and we're pleased that we're already ahead of our early expectations. So just to put it in context, Craig mentioned the K-Series across all four major product areas, we really only got the products out there in the last 12 months across private equity and for real estate and credit. So it's relatively recent for us. We also have our IV vehicle in the market as being also sold to high-net-worth individuals. So there is a big opportunity, and there's more product ideas that are coming out of those conversations with platforms. So we have great early momentum and we're picking up pace, as I said. Craig mentioned Capital Group. We think that is a big opportunity for the firm. The K-Series really goes to be put in a U.S. context to accredited investors which is something that's less than 10% of U.S. households, Capital Group and our partnership there gets us to the mass affluent called the other 90% of U.S. households. They have been fantastic partners and you should expect that we and Capital Group will be doing more together over time. So it's early, but we're really pleased with the results. And as we look at the opportunity and size it for ourselves and think about what this can mean five, 10 years from now. It just continues to get larger than the more time we spend. Rob, do you want to hit the expenses question.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Sure. Bill, just real quickly, any K-Series distribution-related costs, we show in other operating expenses, which is part of the reason why you saw a little bit of an uptick this year. We were, as I'm sure, able to grow our fee revenue at a pace that well exceeded our operating expense growth, even with some of those upward pressures, we were, I want to say, roughly 15.5% OpEx margin last year, and that number was closer to 14% this year. And as we look forward, as it relates to our operating expense and placement fees and related distribution costs, that's about as clear an ROI as we have from a spend here at KKR. So those going up is generally a good thing overall to the model. But other than that, we try and do a really good job to be vigilant on expenses, and we do see the opportunity from here for further margin expansion because we really do believe we're going to be able to continue to skill our revenue base at a level that meaningfully exceeds our head count growth across the firm and the operating complexity that we'll be taking on.
Bill Katz: Thank you very much.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Just a question in Real Assets and Infra. You obviously grew a big diversified platform very well. There are these huge TAMs that we've been seeing in data, data warehouse power. You have your recent partnership with Energy Capital, you have some recent power company acquisitions. So my question is, has anything changed on the heels of DeepSeek? Has it changed the way you think about prices, paid on recent assets and/or demand in the future for what everybody seems to be building in this tremendous data-oriented addressable market? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Hey Glenn, it's Craig. Why don't I start? And I guess why don't we begin with two high-level observations. I think first, and you would have heard this a number of times last week, and I'm thinking on some of the earnings calls across the tech industry, in general, innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that can result obviously in greater adoption and increased demands that can result from that. And second and more specific to the data center business, with the growth in overall data generation, cloud and AI, there's just a need for much more compute. So there's little question in our minds that long-term data center power and infrastructure, demand is growing. Now with that said, as you noted, DeepSeek introduced questions on the demand side, really focused on how much and where, right? So-- and while it's probably too early for really anyone to have a great view around CapEx spend and the like, when we look at our portfolio and our approach, we think we have a number of things really working in our favor. So first, across our five platforms, we did not ascribe any meaningful value to AI demand in our original underwriting. So as an example, our largest investment in the space, CyrusOne -- that was a take-private announced in 2021. The thesis that at that point was entirely driven by cloud demands and the AI dynamics have all been upside. And in our more recent examples, investments, rather, growth driven by cloud, not AI, again, has been really the critical driver. Other things that we look at, location matters in our view. And so our team has been focused on locations that are approximate to key population centers that we think will be difficult to replicate or replace. We do not build speculatively at the platforms. And so instead, you'll see CapEx once you have a contractual customer commitment in hand, and remember, again, these counterparties are often some of the largest, most creditworthy counterparties in the world. And also in a number of our investments, we enjoy downside protection given the terms and the type of security we own in the capital structures. And then in terms of exposures, as you've heard from us on these calls, look, this theme is one that's really critical for us. It's an opportunity where, in our view, scale does matter. So today, we have data center platforms in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Middle East. And on a 100% owned basis, total enterprise value here would be about $50 billion. So it's meaningful. Now at the same time, we have a diversified approach to portfolio construction across our pools of capital, as you know. So at 12/31, these investments are about 6% of our AUM across the infrastructure platform in total. So again, we expect this theme to continue to be really important for us. We'll continue to watch developments very closely. I hope that's helpful.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you. So you were prepared for that question. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Glenn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk to the monetization environment and how you're thinking about that as we start 2025 and really how you see it progressing this year? And what gives you confidence, which I assume is a bit more of a positive outlook on that activity level versus what we've seen in previous periods.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Thanks for the question, Dan. We do see our monetizations up in 2025 relative to 2024 and looking at the environment today pretty comfortably. Equity markets really conducive for that, equity values are high. Credit availability is very high and spreads are really as tight as they've been in quite some time. I also think it's probably helpful to look at some context around the overall monetization environment. We've been monetizing at a pretty healthy pace even through what's been a more challenged time for our industry. And so give you a data point, if you look at our LTM realized private equity carry, and this is a number as of 9/30. We were up 67%. Our public peers were roughly flat. And we think the industry is probably much more in line with our public peers. And so I think you can see across the industry, maybe some client pressure to push unnaturally monetization’s in 2025. I don't think that same dynamic exists here. And so while we expect monetization to increase in 2025, we also expect monetization to continue to increase on the back of that in 2026 and 2027. So we'll see things can move around. But we've got a very healthy portfolio. As you know, our investment returns have been really strong. linear deployment as a key theme across the firm has really helped that. We feel like we're as well positioned as we ever have been as evidenced by the embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet today, close to and approaching $16 billion, a high point for us. And so there's a lot here that gives us the confidence that you're going to see an uptick in monetization. But you're going to need somewhat of a relative benign environment to be able to access that over time.
Dan Fannon: Okay. Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Good morning. Just a question on asset-based finance, I was hoping maybe you could update us on the platform today, the progress that you made over the past year. And as you look ahead to 2025, just maybe you can give us a sense of some of the steps you guys are going to be taking to further expand the sourcing funnel and bank partnerships of the like -- how do you see that coming together? And as you look out over the next couple of years, maybe you can kind of give us a little bit more of a flavor sense for how you see this evolving. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hi. Hey Mike, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, glad you asked about. So first, on Page 13 of our release, this is a page that details of credit and liquid strategies. We break out for that portion for us, our $276 billion or so of AUM. We started doing this second quarter of 2023. Obviously, we'll continue to do that, so total credit AUM is about $250 billion. The private credit piece is about $110 billion. And of that $110 billion, we've got about $70 billion in asset-based finance and another $40 billion in direct lending. In asset-based finance those numbers continue to grow at a pretty impressive rate. That compares to roughly 50 at Q4 of 2023. So we're up over 40% on a year-over-year business basis rather, so big businesses with healthy growth. I think in terms of your question in the outlook, both the ABS is a massive market, $6 trillion on its way to $9 trillion In our view, you have high barriers to entry, a lack of scale capital and in our view, lots of folks leaving this market that's creating a void. So we're finding attractive risk reward. I think our clients like the diversification away from regular way corporate credit and I think the education that our clients have as it relates to asset-based finance just continues. It feels like we're in the early innings. In some ways, it feels as though it's like direct lending was three, four, five years ago. And we do think that by having global land fully integrated into everything that we're doing in the framework of the firm, this positions us really well for this opportunity. And I think as it relates to banks and bank partnerships, we see their activity – we expect the broad trends to continue. I think when we look overall in the industry, banks today are well capitalized and they have healthy liquidity, right? Capital ratios are up. I know you know this very well. What that brings to is a real focus on ROE and banks have a finite amount of risk-weighted assets to generate that ROE. So a bank can be an excellent originator. But if there aren't additional economics, if they aren't recurring fees or other revenues, they may not be an excellent holder. And that creates opportunities for us. Because as banks make these decisions and how and where they're going to allocate their RWA, some business lines are going to be kepts, they're going to be optimized, they're going to be scaled and others are going to be shed. And in some ways, it almost feels like there isn't much of it in between. And so this dynamic in our view, isn't going to change. Now maybe we see a little less SRT activity at the margin, but the broad trends, again, aren't changing, lots of continued opportunity for us.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Chubak: Hi, good morning.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Steven Chubak: So I wanted to ask a question on the fundraising outlook. I asked a similar one last quarter. But Scott, just borrowing from the running analogy, you noted that you guys achieved $114 billion of fundraising and that was with little contribution from flagships and some tougher market conditions. So given the upcoming fundraising super cycle in 2025, some better conditions you cited, I was hoping you could frame the upside potential versus that $100 billion fundraising target and the sustainability of some of the drivers of strength in 2024, whether that should continue into 2025.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. I'll try, Steven. We don't -- as, we don't put out specific numbers on this. We had shared at our Investor Day $300-plus billion over the course of 2024 to 2026. We're still very comfortable with those numbers and the plus after them. In terms of the sustainability of the drivers, I think part of the reason that you're hearing the optimism in our voices is we think number of things you saw last year are sustainable into this year, so Global Atlantic continuing to grow. Institutions being more aggressive around deploying capital and now that they're getting more capital back. We've seen that continue across areas like private credit and infrastructure. We're seeing more optimism across private equity now. And I'd say there's a more universal view that real estate equity, which had been out of favor has bottomed. And so there's more interest in that asset class as well that's just emerging. So a continuation of what we saw last year and frankly, a bit more optimism and momentum than we had last year, private wealth Capital Group gaining momentum, Capital Group just starting out. And so you kind of put all that together and say everything we saw last year, we expect will continue or improve over the course of this year and next. And then on top of that, to your point, you've got the flagship funds that are going to be in the market for a greater percentage of the year. And so when we put all that together, and that's part of the reason that you're hearing us be more upbeat about what we're seeing. And we think all of that gets fed by the monetization environment improving. As people get more money back, they're going to look to deploy. So we managed to raise the 114 it was our second best year ever, frankly, with a backdrop that was imperfect. And we think when we look at everything that I just mentioned, it feels like we're going up. I can't give you a number as to where it goes. But if we execute and the environment stays as we expect, we think you'll continue to see increased momentum.
Craig Larson: Only thing I'd add a couple of fun facts, just on this. The first relates to the breadth of the platform. So if you add up the capital we raised in 2024 in our more traditional private equity strategies, so mid-market PE, Americas PE, OUR K-Series, that represented 5% of the new capital we raised across the firm. It's an interesting statistic. Now to be clear, we feel great about the work done across all of those initiatives. But I think it speaks to the development and growth across KKR. And in contrast, 85% of the capital we raised came from our credit and real assets businesses where we think there's a lot more running room as well. And then the second piece relates to innovation. Again, two-thirds of the capital raised in 2024 were in strategies that didn't exist within KKR five years ago and with opportunities for us in things like the capital group, again knock-on wood, there will be an opportunity for that to continue to grow. And we did speak at our Investor Day, I know you'll remember about the maturation and the continuing maturation of our strategies in claims. So again, just thought some of those statistics would be interesting.
Steven Chubak: That's great color. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Brown: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Got some questions on the performance on Slide 10. I just wanted to ask about the 0% return or kind of the flat return quarter-over-quarter for the traditional PE full year result that 14% is certainly good. But I guess why flat quarter-over-quarter, was there something to call out that drove that? And then does the buyout land, the trend of public to private has certainly been a very popular theme. How are you thinking about opportunities here? And what are some of the key themes you're leaning into now? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Mike, why don't I start? Look, I think in many ways, Q4 evidence of the difficulty looking at big broad indices. So S&P was up 2.5% in Q4. And look, the average market cap S&P name is about $110 billion. I think in contrast, if you look at the Russell 2000, which in many ways is a lot more representative of the companies and portfolios and opportunities that we're pursuing, it was flat in the quarter, and that dynamic is one that's even greater when you look over the course of calendar 2024, S&P was up 25% and the Russell was up 11.5%. So I think to the heart of your question, we actually feel – it's tough to look at these performance numbers over any 90-day period and draw any broad conclusions, but we continue to feel really good about broad execution in the traditional PE part of our business. I think that's true in 2024, and I think that's true more broadly looking across vintages.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. And the second part of your question, Mike, I'd say I'd broaden it. Yes, there's opportunity in public to private space and there's just a lot of dispersion in the market. There are some industries that are getting a lot of attention. But if you're a smaller market cap company, a lot of what we're doing is $1 billion to $5 billion you don't get the same attention from the analyst community, from the investor community, you can get a little left behind it. And we're finding a number of management teams that just are not enjoying quarter-to-quarter reality. And so we continue to see that as a big opportunity for us globally, which I'll come back to. I would also point to not just that type of transaction, I'd say corporate carve-outs, strategists want to have simple stories. And so, if they've got something that's creating some complexity and operating subsidiary that maybe doesn't fit their current narrative, they're looking to sell those. And that's actually been our best performing type of investment in private equity over our nearly 49-year history is corporate carve-out. So we're seeing opportunities there. I think you're also going to see more sponsor-to-sponsor activity as sponsors look to give capital back to their LPs in this environment and as I mentioned, this really is a global set of opportunities. So Japan, we've been particularly active in a market that continues to open up. Europe is relatively cheap number of companies based there that had global operations that are maybe trading at a European discount today. So there's lots of different ways for us to express these views around the world. Let me start there, but we do see the deployment opportunity is very attractive.
Mike Brown: Great Scott and thank you, Craig. I definitely understand that the quarterly moves are just one data point about the bigger trend. So thank you for that.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Gandhi with HSBC. Please proceed with your question.
Vikram Gandhi: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. My question is really related to GA. Looking at the growth in the adjusted book value versus the operating earnings, it appears that the group has been injecting about $400 million of capital each quarter last year. The impression I had was that GA was quite well capitalized even considering a reasonable growth. So I wondered how should we think about the growth going forward in the earnings run rate for 2025?
Robert Lewin: Yes, Great. Thanks, Vikram. I'll handle both those questions. So first thing, the capital contributed in the course of 2024. Some of that capital was contributed as part of the original transaction when we funded in early January. And then we also said at the time that we were going to look across the KKR balance sheet on the asset management side to see what assets could be really conducive to an insurance company balance sheet, so what you also see is some contribution in kind, some investments that fit frankly, better on an insurance company balance sheet. As it relates to performance, let me reiterate and go back to what Scott said in the prepared remarks, we're feeling great about how our teams are coordinating today, the opportunity in front of us. I was all the ingredients that reside inside of our broader firm today to continue to build what we think is a really unique and highly profitable insurance franchise. And we've also talked about evolving our approach a bit, and then you're seeing that play out through the P&L. And what that means is on behalf of our clients, we are taking on longer-dated liabilities, so elongating our liability profile. As part of that, we're doing a bit more on the private side, really taking advantage for the first time the full breadth of KKR's investment suite. And so what you're going to see, we believe, is definitely, if we perform, and we've got confidence we'll definitely better P&L outcomes and ROEs over time from this evolved shift. But very intentionally, we're bringing down ROE and the accounting P&L as we transition. And the reason for that is many of the privates that we are doing and where we've got really differentiated origination capabilities, they've got modest yields and in some cases, no yields. And so we feel good about the underlying economics even at the time when naturally, you're going to see subdued accounting P&L. And so to be clear, we would expect over the next couple of quarters to have insurance operating earnings that is plus or minus where we were in Q4 and that is the expectation as we make the shift. But at the same time, the underlying economics of what we are doing, we feel good about it. And as we perform, it's going to show up in the P&L over time.
Vikram Gandhi: Very helpful, thank you.
Robert Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Good morning. Thank you. Yes. I was just wondering if you could expand on the question you had earlier about the flagship private equity funds. And I guess just I'm looking at Infrastructure V and the Global Climate Fund, there are still raising money, but don't look like they've made investments yet. And I'm wondering how long is that investment period open? And should we expect kind of meaningful catch-up fees there at some point? And then on Europe and Asia, those funds look like they're roughly half called when should we expect fundraising to commence for those successor funds?
Craig Larson: Chris, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, I think we've got a very healthy pipeline in terms of individual funds and strategies that we are fundraising for Infra strategy continues to be a front-burner topic for us as of 12/31, we raised 11, last one was 17. So we feel great about progress. We did turn that fund on in the middle of last year. So that is something where you're seeing management fees. We do expect also to launch fundraising for our Asia infrastructure strategy here shortly, so more to come as it relates to businesses that in particular. We think there's a real big opportunity for us to grow, build and scale at the same time. So it's just tough on individual funds to parse through. I think the one other reminder when you look at the fund table, we will often draw -- when we make an investment and draw capital under capital call line that's paid back typically in 180 days or less. So when you actually look at those deployment figures, they often are understated relative to capital as we look at the available capital that's remaining. And then the second dynamic there is if we have a platform build, again, that and something where we expect to invest capital over a multiyear period of time, and if the first piece of that has been called only that first piece shows up in that invested line. So I think just overall, when you're looking at the funds and the status where we are, and how close we are to whether it's fundraising or turning on a fund, the numbers that you would or the percentage figures that you would be looking at in terms of that table, if anything tend to be understated.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add Chris, is you're right to observe that we're in the market with a number of these strategies still today, including infra and climate. You got North American private equity, Europe private equity to follow. And Asia probably before Europe would be my guess and just in terms of sequencing. So we'll keep you posted in future quarters as we launch those incremental strategies. I think the bigger, higher level point though, these last two years, we raised $183 billion give or take, only about 10% of that was from flagship farms. So the point from the prior discussion, it should be quite additive as we head into the next couple of years.
Chris Kotowski: Okay, thanks. That’s it from me.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our last question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning everyone. Just quickly back on the monetization theme. Could you give the usual visible realized cash flow stat that you give? And then more broadly, another firm made it pretty clear, I think, last week that they thought this monetization theme was more a second half event it sounds like today, you might think the situation is different for KKR, is that the case or do you agree it could be more of a second half event? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Patrick, just in terms of timing, I think things will be pretty fluid here. So it's hard to pinpoint it in any half of the year. I'll reiterate our expectation is that we do expect monetization’s to be up for us in 2025 versus 2024 based on the current market conditions. As it relates to a specific question on visibility that we have, we've got approaching $400 million of that high visibility revenue, things that have already been signed up or announced just based on regulatory approvals, unclear that all hits in Q1. So pretty good visibility as we head into the year. You typically see this period of time where pipelines are rebuilding after deals get closed -- tried to get closed by year-end. Of course, five weeks into the quarter and our pipelines are pretty strong right now. So we'll see what transpires for the quarter and we'll keep you guys abreast.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson: Thank you. And we'd just like to thank everybody for your continued attention and interest in KKR, and we look forward to giving everybody the next update in 90 days or so. Thank you so much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So to begin this quarter, we thought we would highlight three things. First, as you would have already seen through our earnings release, we had a strong Q3. Fee-related earnings for the quarter eclipsed $1 billion for the first time. And on a per share basis, the $1.12 of FRE per share is 32% ahead of the results we reported just last quarter, which was up until today a record figure for KKR. And ANI per share of $1.38 is the second highest quarterly figure we've reported in our history, up over 50% compared to Q3 of last year. So impressive growth and delivery in a quarter where the pace of exit activity across our industry is still accelerating. Second, you're seeing tangible signs of momentum across our operating metrics. Investment performance continues to be a bright spot as we perform on behalf of our clients and reflecting this performance, our gross unrealized carried interest balance increased 11% from just last quarter and has increased 42% compared to 1-year ago. On the heels of strong investment performance, we raised $87 billion of new capital year-to-date. This is more than double the amount we raised over the first 9 months of 2023, and we remain at an early stage of our current fundraising super cycle, at the same time that we're seeing continued progress in scaling across our wealth initiatives. And deployment year-to-date totaled $61 billion, also more than double the investment activity reported over the first 9 months of 2023. And third, you're seeing tangible signs of how KKR and our business model in our view can deliver differentiated financial results for all of us as shareholders. Total operating earnings. Remember, this is our fee-related earnings together with our Insurance segment as well as the net dividends from strategic holdings. We're $1.47 per share in Q3. These are our more durable businesses. So looking at this differently, total operating earnings and more durable and recurring pieces of our business, comprised over 80% of our pre-tax earnings as a firm for Q3, as well as on a year-to-date and a trailing 12-month basis. And thinking through the profile and trajectory of total operating earnings, remember that we expect the net dividends from strategic holdings to increase materially over the coming years. We believe strategic holdings will be a truly unique driver of future financial performance for KKR for years to come. And finally, also highlighting our business model and how we work together, the results we reported in the third quarter in our capital markets business are noteworthy with $424 million of capital markets revenues in the quarter, driven by the increased investment activity that I mentioned a moment ago. So with that as an introduction, let me walk through our segment income statement in more detail. Management fees in the quarter were $893 million, representing an increase of 5% since Q2, and 18% year-over-year. Again, 18% growth in management fees year-over-year. This increase was driven by fees turning on in the quarter for our flagship infrastructure fund, the final close of Ascendant, and fees from Global Climate, as well as continued success within our private wealth vehicles. Total transaction and monitoring fees totaled $467 million. This includes the $424 million of capital markets fees mentioned a moment ago, a record figure for us as a public company. Fee-related performance revenues in the quarter were $57 million. This quarter was the first quarter our onshore K-Series infra vehicle earned its annual incentive fee and as you'll recall our offshore vehicle earned its annual incentive fee for the first time last quarter in Q2. So with good performance, we expect this cadence to continue annually for both our onshore and offshore vehicles. In aggregate, fee-related revenues were $1.4 billion. This is up over 50% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Fee-related compensation, as usual, was right at the midpoint of our guided range, which as a reminder is 17.5%. Other operating expenses came in at $168 million. As we noted earlier this year, we would expect this line item to increase modestly over time. As an example, we do expect placement fees to increase as fundraising continues to ramp. So putting this all together, FRE was just over $1 billion for the quarter, or $1.12 per share with an FRE margin of 71% and FRE per share is up 78% compared to Q3 of '23. Insurance operating earnings were $308 million for the quarter. The run rate here is still at that $250 million level, plus or minus, as we discussed on last quarter's call as the results this quarter benefited from approximately $50 million of earnings that came primarily from GA's annual actuarial assumption review. Strategic holdings operating earnings were $7 million in Q3 and we expect a similar level in Q4. These figures compared to the $62 million of net dividends reported for the first half of 2024, which were ahead of our expectations. And as we've discussed, the trajectory of these earnings won't be linear in these early days. And more importantly, we continue to see consistent growth across the underlying businesses and are tracking nicely towards our expected $300 plus million of net dividends by '26 and $600 plus million by 2028. And as context for the portfolio as a whole, KKR's share of the 12-month revenue and EBITDA generated by these 18 businesses was $3.6 billion and approximately $900 million, respectively. And year-over-year, we saw 14% like-for-like growth in revenue and 11% growth in EBITDA. The portfolio has scaled and continues to grow nicely and importantly again remains on track to deliver meaningful net dividends in the years ahead. So in aggregate, total operating earnings were $1.47 per share, a record quarter, and 25% ahead of last quarter and represented 81% of segment earnings. Moving on to investing earnings within our Asset Management segment, realized performance income was $392 million and realized investment income was $152 million, and we had $88 million of net realized investment income within our Strategic Holding segment. So in total, investing earnings after compensation were $318 million. After interest expense and taxes, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion, or $1.38 per share, up 57% on a year-over-year basis from the third quarter of last year. Now finally turning to investment performance in Page 10 of the earnings release. The traditional private equity portfolio appreciated 5% in the quarter and 17% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 2 in the quarter and up 3 in the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform well, up 6% in Q3 and 18% in the LTM. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite was up 2 and the alternative credit composite was up 3 in the third quarter. And performance here over the last 12 months was up 11% and up 12%, respectively. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. Last quarter, we highlighted that we were seeing significantly greater market activity and momentum across the firm. Those trends were clearly seen in the results that Craig just ran through. In a lot of ways, this was a quarter where the numbers speak for themselves. So I thought that I would focus on a few of the key drivers looking forward; deployment, monetization, fundraising, as well as our unique business model. Starting first with deployment, we have seen a meaningful acceleration in activity. And if you take a step back, we have built scaled global businesses to invest behind many of the mega themes that are driving global growth. We discussed this at Investor Day earlier this year, but I will highlight three particularly significant areas this morning. Number one is infrastructure. We know that the need for infrastructure investment is massive. Our footprint here positions us incredibly well. Our global infra business has now scaled to $77 billion of AUM. Remember we were just $13 billion 5 years ago, and all of that growth has been organic. We are particularly well-positioned across all themes digital infrastructure, and we are seeing this theme play out globally. There are really three pillars of activity here. The first is mobile infrastructure, so think of the tower industry. Second is fixed line infrastructure, fiber-to-the-home. And third are themes in the Cloud AI storage and data center space. Our footprint in data centers is particularly large. To give you a sense, we currently own four platforms operating across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. And looking on a 100% own basis, because we don't own a 100% of all of them, the total enterprise value of those platforms and their contracted and highly visible pipeline is over $150 billion. The second theme that I wanted to highlight this morning is credit. The credit markets that we participate in is a $40 trillion plus market and we are seeing the benefits of a scaled global platform with $240 billion plus of AUM. Our asset-based finance team, as an example, continues to be particularly active. In total, AUM across our ABF platform exceeds $65 billion. That's up 40% versus last year. And we have a real leadership position across an area that has significant market tailwinds. And finally, Asia remains one of the most dynamic parts of the world. We've had a meaningful presence in the region for close to two decades and are by far the leading alternatives platform on the ground today with nearly $70 billion of AUM. We are incredibly well-positioned to generate significant scale and value for our enterprise over the next decade plus. We are particularly excited about the opportunities in Japan across multiple asset classes. Japan is a market where today we have real leadership. We opened our first office in the country in 2006, so almost two decades ago. Together with KJRM, we have over 200 people in Tokyo, helping us source and originate investment opportunities up and down the capital structure. Global Atlantic has now closed on two reinsurance transactions within the last 12 months. And in aggregate, we have $25 billion of AUM across all of our strategies in Japan. Taken together, our footprint provides us with a lot of confidence around competing in the local markets and further scaling from here. Turning next to monetizations. We've seen an uptick here given readily accessible debt markets, the improved tone across global equity markets, and increased M&A volumes. To give you a sense of this, the total gross proceeds from monetization activity in our private equity and real assets businesses year-to-date have been approximately $13 billion. That is up over 60% from the same time last year. And as we look ahead, presuming the market backdrop remains constructive, we expect you'll see a further acceleration of activity across the industry. And against this backdrop, we feel very well-positioned. One of the areas that we watch closely as a management team is the maturity of our portfolios. Today we are in a very good position, which reflects our discipline, we think, around investment pacing and linear deployment. First, we have a number of public positions with meaningful embedded gains. As of quarter end, six of our sizable positions were trading between 4x and over 30x cost. Just looking at our private equity portfolio overall, over 60% of fair value is marked at 1.5x cost or greater, with approximately 30% marked at 2x cost or greater. In addition, our real assets businesses are currently under-earning as our portfolios continue to mature. In total, our gross unrealized carried interest stands at $7.9 billion at quarter end. That's up 40% year-on-year. And looking more broadly, if you include our balance sheet investments, so as a reminder, this does not include core private equity. The total embedded gains are $10.9 billion, which is also up 40% year-on-year. When you factor in that we have been monetizing at a healthy pace relative to the industry, this stat really does speak to the strength of our investment performance as well as the health of our global portfolio. And I think all of this really positions us well to generate future investing earnings. Turning next to new capital raised. This totaled $24 billion for the quarter, bringing us to over $85 billion year-to-date. In the quarter, nearly half of this activity was driven by credit, as our business has grown alongside the capabilities of Global Atlantic. Two additional topics of note here. First, our K-Series vehicle saw strong fundraising, with over $2 billion of new capital raised in Q3, driven by our private equity and our infrastructure strategies. And looking at K-Series across all four investing verticals, we are now at $14 billion of AUM. That's up from $5 billion a year ago. We're continuing to launch our products and new platforms and are still ramping on those that we've been added to already. We remain really encouraged by our progress to date with a tremendous amount of opportunity still in front of us. And second, over time we have talked about long-dated multi-asset class strategic partnerships that have recycling provisions. Given the breadth as well as the connectivity across our firm, we are uniquely positioned to create these types of partnerships. This quarter, rather, we closed on a $3 billion real asset strategic partnership with a large sovereign wealth fund, which we expect will positively impact both our infrastructure and real estate platforms for two plus decades. Before I conclude, I did want to spend a few minutes on a couple of elements of our model that I think are really unique and also operating at a very high-level. First on Global Atlantic, on the last couple of earnings calls we talked about GA operating with elevated levels of liquidity after the large block transactions closed at the end of last year as well as early this year. We have seen increased coordination and investment activity across several of our asset classes, including now infrastructure, real estate and credit. We remain encouraged by the quality of the deal flow that we were able to match up against some of the very long-dated liabilities that we have taken on. And the second area I wanted to touch on was that you really saw the power of our business model this quarter with our capital markets business producing record revenues of $424 million. This reflected activity across infrastructure, traditional private equity and credit, as well as existing portfolio company opportunistic financings and third-party transactions. While the quarter did benefit from a few sizable fee events as well as timing, around 100 different transactions contributed to the outcome this quarter, which demonstrates the breadth and diversification of our business. Now, we don't think $400 plus million is the new quarterly run rate for our capital markets business, but this quarter really illustrates the degree to which our model is built to capture very significant economics. We have built this part of our business very deliberately, and being able to achieve these types of outcomes is not a surprise. Just to close out, our management team remains incredibly excited about the potential of our firm and our ability to inflect up in a recovering deal and exit environment. And as we look to the rest of the year, we will continue to stay just as focused on scaling our businesses and taking full advantage of the unique capabilities that our model presents. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Rob, Craig. Hope everyone's doing well. My question is on the infrastructure business. So, very strong returns, best performing business over the last 12 months and also in the quarter. And infra also contributed to about 50% of your capital market transaction fees which were also at record level. So these are really big numbers for infra where return targets and size are both smaller than P. So two questions here. Big picture, what's driving the outside performance, and is it sustainable into 2025? I know there is at least one large lumpy item in the capital market transaction fee line going.
Craig Larson: Hi, Craig. Thank you for the comments. Why don't I start? Rob, I'll let you pick up on the capital markets piece at the end. Look, in terms of the franchise as a whole, I thought Raj [ph], and again, thank you for the kind introduction. I think Raj did a great job reviewing our infra business and the opportunities we see at our Investor Day just a little over 3 months ago. And I guess maybe 5 months ago at this point. And I think as we look how the business is situated, we've got a series of very distinct market segments. We've got the global infra series, Asia infra, diversified core. We now have the infra vehicles customized for private wealth investors. And that's even with climate as another strategy that's adjacent where there's lots of opportunity. And Rob mentioned a couple of statistics that really are super impressive. 5 years ago AUM was $15 billion, as of 9/30 we're at $77 billion, all organic. And so I think what you're seeing here is a business that continues to grow in scale. We do think there are scale advantages as it relates to the business and the formation and the outlook from here. The performance has been one that's very strong. You're going to have, again, puts and takes in any individual quarter. I think when you look at individual -- when you look at performance over the trailing 12-month basis and you look back historically, you've seen this dynamic where you've seen consistent performance over time. And, of course, performance is really going to be the key driver of outcomes here. And I think when you look at our Infra 1 and our Infra 2 fund series, those are very mature funds for us. You've seen a very consistent series of results and I think you're seeing that same pattern of performance as Funds 3 and 4 then mature and you're seeing just performance progress from the time that those investment periods first began.
Rob Lewin: Craig, I'll pick up on just the capital markets question real quick. Obviously, a really strong quarter for us in capital markets. I did mention that we had a couple or few chunkier transactions, which is really to be expected in quarters of high levels of deployment and activity. But I also note that we had over 100 different transactions contribute to the quarter, and I really do think it shows the diversification and breadth of the business model. And you mentioned it, a big quarter as it relates to infrastructure, but obviously we have lots of other parts of our business that contribute a great deal to our capital markets business over time, whether that's private equity, traditional core private equity aspects of credit, what we're building across Global Atlantic, our geographic breadth, so lots of different ways for us to positively impact the P&L.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you. I'm curious if we could talk a little bit about Asset-Based Finance. I know it's a very active quarter. You mentioned the 45% or so growth to $65 billion, but I was looking for a little more color of where do those assets sit, which product strategies, and then where are you sourcing the assets from? What's coming from your direct origination channels? Where are you growing platforms versus forming some partnerships? Just a little more behind the scenes would be great. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Hey, Glenn, its Craig, why don't I start? Scott may have a couple of things to add at the end, but you're correct. That part of our business has been super active. So, as you heard from Rob, $66 billion of AUM, up 40% over the last 12 months. And the great thing about having a business of that scale is we can be relevant at a whole bunch of different levels of risk reward. So insurance activity, when we look at Global Atlantic together with our other insurance clients, so this is really investment grade, really single A-rated credit. If you look at our origination here, this is both on [indiscernible] committed basis. Origination was $22 billion year-to-date. So on a run rate basis, we're at a $30 billion annual pace, more than double our pace of activity in 2023. And on the platforms, I'm glad you mentioned, across KKR as a whole. Look, we have 35 platforms, including real estate, helping generate differentiated origination for us. 7,000 people waking up every day, looking to help source proprietary origination. It's a real advantage for us. And then on top of that activity, you've got flow, you've got partnership, you've got big corporate deals. And so I think you've seen a number of transactions involving our team with a lot of really big brands in finance. PayPal, Discover would be examples that come to mind. So it just feels like there's a lot of momentum behind the business and honestly a lot more for us to do at the same time.
Scott Nuttall: Hey Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. In terms of where it sits, that part of your question, a variety of places. So we have funds, separate accounts, obviously Global Atlantic. These are great assets for the GA balance sheet and third-party insurers. And we've also been able to create structures that allow us to deliver this on an investment-grade basis and a non-investment-grade basis, depending on what the underlying client wants. And I think Craig did a great job summarizing. The only other thing I would point out, this is a very large market. It's about $5 trillion on its way to $7 trillion. So a significant opportunity for growth ahead. So $65 billion is just the start.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you for all that.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Alexander Blostein: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the Real Assets segment, but maybe a little bit more broadly. Really strong fundraising momentum there, and I know there's been a lot of focus in global infra, but this quarter it seemed to be pretty broad based. You talked about climate and real estate in the prepared remarks in the press release. How are you thinking about sizing these other flagships, so climate, North America real estate, and it also looks like you're pretty far along in European and Asia real estate, APAC infra. So maybe a little bit more holistically, how are you thinking about fundraising outside of the mega kind of flagship infra fund [ph] there? And then specifically within real estate, what are you hearing from clients on the ground as far as demand for that product goes? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Alex, why don't I start? It's been really great within Real Assets since we split out that business line a couple of years ago to see the development of both of those businesses. Infra at this point is approaching $80 billion. Real estate is at $80 billion. I'm pretty equally split between real estate equity and real estate credit. And in terms of the opportunities for us to continue to grow, build and scale, honestly, it's one of the things that we love talking about in how we think about how we're situated. If you go back again to some of the things you've heard us talk about over time, over 80% of our strategies and our view are yet at scale. And so if you think of real estate, in particular, we've got over a dozen independent vehicles that are growing, building, scaling and just creates a tremendous amount of opportunity. And I think on the investment side and dialogue from LPs, I think one of the most encouraging signs, if anything, relates to operating trends over the course of this year, it does feel as though, again, you would have heard this in the market, but it does feel like valuations knock on wood bottomed a year ago or so. You've seen us vote with our wallets, if you will, like investment activity over the last 12 months in real estate has increased significantly for us. To give you a stat within real estate, year-to-date total deployment is approaching $12 billion. The first 9 months of 2023, we were at about 5. And I think when we think of that investment activity and the progress we've seen operationally, we feel really good about that decision to lean in. So lots of momentum, lots of opportunities for us looking forward.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Alex, it's Scott. Just on your question, so I would say just higher level, the infrastructure and real estate credit, along with private credit and areas like ABF, we've continued to see a lot of activity and interest from a fundraising standpoint. Allocations have been created, commitments are being made. I would put climate in that category. It's a younger strategy, but I put it in that same category. So don't have a target to give you today, but obviously the investment need is significant. And we think that can be a really large-scale business for us over the time. Real estate equity, as we talked about last quarter, the perspective has been evolving in the markets. Our view is that the real estate markets bottomed in the last half of last year. Part of the reason that we've leaned in so much this year, and you heard stats from Craig, is our view that the bottom was behind us. And I think that perspective is starting to be shared by others. So we are hearing sentiment shift on real estate equity. I think with rates starting to come down, you're going to hear more of that. So we've been leaning in, and I think there's beginning to be a perspective that this is a good time to invest. And over time, you'll see that show up in our Americas, Europe and Asia funds, we believe. But sentiment is definitely turning, and it may take a little bit of time for the capital to start to show up, but we feel like we're in a good spot today and we have those strategies in the market.
Alexander Blostein: All right. Thanks so much.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Bill Katz: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe just to look at the wealth management opportunity a little bit which is scaling very nicely and appreciate you gave a little bit of snippets in the prepared commentary. I wonder if we could unpack that a little bit further and maybe just talk about where you're seeing the best traction, which vertical? You mentioned that you're sort of getting onto more platforms, a few new ones yet coming. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about where you are in sort of the arc of those, if you will. And then I was wondering now with 3 months closer to get updated a little bit on any sort of early stage opportunities or fund design with Capital Group. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Bill, it's Craig. Why don't I start? First just stepping back for a moment for everybody. So as of September 30, we have around $75 billion of AUM from individuals. And that does not include policyholders at GA. So if anything, that $75 billion is probably understated when you think about the breadth of our presence and the activity that we have. And the majority of that has been capital from high net worth, ultra high net worth individuals over time who have been investing in our funds. And over time, that capital from individuals has been a low double-digit percentage of new capital raised for us. And then most recently, as you noted, we've introduced our K-Series suite of products. We've got products currently that are being marketed across the four investing verticals for us, private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. They're all in different stages of their evolution. $14 billion today, $5 billion a year ago. It just continues to feel like we've got lots of great momentum. We think -- we look at the market share statistics in terms of capital raised year-to-date, feel great about our position, albeit with a lot of wood to chop from here. I think recognizing -- I think in particular, we felt real strength in private equity as well as infrastructure. And I'd say that it is both with those asset classes and that is international as well as domestic. So when you look within those two vehicles, AUM is probably a 60-40 split between the U.S. and outside the U.S. That feels like a really healthy balance to us. So I think when we look at that opportunity, it's multiple asset classes and its global. I think the other -- just the other point to highlight, we have launched those vehicles ahead of the fundraising that we've launched for our private BDC. So I think when you look in the industry, you've seen a lot of capital that has been raised in the private credit opportunity and private BDCs. That is one of the pieces that I think we're going to, in particular, see lots more growth and momentum and opportunity for us as we continue to see growth across a number of platforms, a handful of larger ones which are in the very near-term. And then, Scott, I don't know if you have anything to add on Capital Group.
Scott Nuttall: No, I think first off on the wealth management topic, I think there's a lot of different parts of our firm, Bill, that we've got a lot of growth ahead and the potential is far greater than what's showing up in the numbers. And I think Craig covered it well, but we are getting onto a number of different platforms every quarter. We've now launched in all four product areas. But the full run rate is not in the numbers yet. So we think you're going to continue to see gaining momentum across everything we're doing in wealth. You're also seeing this across a bunch of different parts of the firm, including the real asset space. We talked about capital raising and infrastructure, but these businesses, in terms of what's showing up in the P&L, the carry, the investment earnings, they're not showing up yet, but they're going to show up. And so I think we've got a lot of different parts of the firm that we see embedded growth. There's latent earnings that will continue to show up and latent AUM that will continue to show up as we continue to scale here. On Capital Group, we shared earlier this year that we're going to start with two credit vehicles together. That's very much on track. We are also spending time on product design across the other product verticals and alternatives. And so you'll hear more about that in future quarters.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Please proceed.
Brian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, it was great to see the nice step up in accrued performance income during the quarter. I'm assuming a lot of this was driven by strong investment performance, but were there any funds that flipped into carry during the quarter or any newer strategies that are starting to contribute more meaningfully to the accrual? And then with respect to the $3 billion of asset management, embedded gains on the balance sheet, how should we think about just the timing of monetizing this over time?
Rob Lewin: Hey, Brian, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. What you saw in the quarter in the 7.9 of accrued carry, I'd say that that is much more broad-based performance, where you're really starting to see us inflect up. It comes from our real assets portfolio in particular, infrastructure of course, if you look at our flagship infrastructure funds, we went from 1 to 3 to 7 to 17 plus. And so as we scaled and performed, you're going to see that accrued carry build and then importantly now you're starting to see that realized carry start to flow through the P&L as well. As it relates to the balance sheet embedded gains, listen, I think that's going to be a function of the monetization environment. And when you're going to see that flow through the P&L right now, we are seeing more opportunities to be able to create access for our portfolio companies, which is where largely most of that embedded gain on the balance sheet sits. And so, I would say if the environment remains constructive over the course of 2025, we would expect to be able to generate some more material balance sheet related realizations through the next 12 months.
Brian McKenna: Okay.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I would add, Brian, is just for -- and thanks for the question. From a higher altitude comment standpoint, as we've talked about in the past, including at the Investor Day, it takes about 10 to 15 years to scale AUM in our business. You've got to get to Fund 3, Fund 4. As you know, we used to have 5 or 6 strategies at KKR. I was looking at our fundraising sheet last week. We have 57 line items this year, just to give you a sense. So it's 10 to 15 years to get to scale. And then it's oftentimes 5 to 10 years after you get to scale that you start to see carry and investing earnings show up at scale. And remember, we went from that 6 line items to 57 since the end of the financial crisis. So as you think about the momentum we have behind us, to Rob's point, and just what's coming, the 1 billion to 3 billion to 7 billion to 17 billion as an example in infrastructure, that's not really in our earnings yet from a carry standpoint. We have that happening in a lot of different places across the firm, which is part of the reason you hear such confidence in our voices.
Brian McKenna: Got it. Thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Brian.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Steven Chubak: Hi. Good morning.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Steven Chubak: So I wanted to ask a follow-up question just on the fundraising outlook. If we benchmark fundraising trends year-to-date versus the target $300 billion that you outlined at Investor Day, you've already fundraised $85 billion, tracking ahead of goal despite a limited contribution from flagships. And just given the constructive [indiscernible] on this call, improving momentum, both institutional and retail, just was hoping to get a bit of a mark-to-market on whether that target feels conservative given some of the tailwinds that you're seeing. I recognize it's supposed to be a multi-year target, but any perspective you can offer just given some of the strength and the recent fundraising momentum would be helpful.
Craig Larson: Hey, Steven, why don't I start and Scott or Rob, I'm sure, may have another couple of thoughts. I think first in terms of the 300 plus, I think you're correct. Look, we feel great about the momentum that we have in the execution you've seen today. We don't have a new number for you today, but I think if anything, our confidence level on the 300 plus, just given everything that we've done, if anything, just would have increased. Now I think in terms of some of the statistics, because you're right, it is worth spending a moment just on the implications from a flagship standpoint, because we've -- in the last couple of years, that activity has been pretty modest. So just for a little bit of background, when we refer to our flagships, these are really our largest fund complexes across KKR. So I think Americas PE, Asia, Europe PE, core private equity and global infra and over 2020 and 2021, over $60 billion of new capital raised came from our flagships. It was almost 40% of our fundraising. And those numbers more recently have been quite modest. So in 2022 and 2023, we raised $150 billion, but only 6 came from the flagships. Again 6 versus that 60. And so now over the LTM, you're starting to see some progress. $118 billion in total, 11 coming from the flagships. So a nice start, but as we think about the balance of '24 and '25, just given continued activity across Infra, as well as our Americas and Asia PE strategies, we just think that activity has the opportunity to be meaningful and incremental to what you've seen from us. And so when you think about us as a whole, we've got flagship opportunities, we've got continued scaling in an institutional fundraising, as you would have heard. Again, back to 80% of our strategy is not yet at scale. And then on top of that, we've got the continued scaling and the opportunities we have in wealth, both through K-Series and Capital Group. And that's a long time -- and that’s alongside the opportunities we have at Global Atlantic and Global Atlantic Sidecars, for that matter. So there's just a -- there's a lot for us to do. It feels like we have a lot of momentum. And, again, thanks for the question.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, the only thing I'd add, Steven, is we do feel quite positive. We really like our setup. Not surprisingly, you're really good at math. So I would just -- I would lean even more into the plus.
Steven Chubak: Well said.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Patrick Davitt: I'm going to be Debbie Downer and ask an election question. We usually take the view that elections don't matter much either way, but one looming big change that could come this time is clearly tariffs on markets appear to be pricing that in to some extent. So aside from inflation and rate impacts, do you have any initial thoughts on how the existing portfolio could be negatively or even positively impacted by tariffs and or a trade war? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Yes, Patrick, I'm not going to surprise you. We spend most of our team time here focusing on things that we can control. That's not one of them. But at the same time, we also do have a team here that's focused on scenario planning across multiple different areas, whether that's the existing portfolio or new portfolio. As you said I think there's going to be some pluses and minuses depending on the geography of our portfolio companies. The sectors they're in, what their cost base are made of. There's all kinds of different inputs and so we're watching it closely. I think it's fair to say that our teams are ready to react and we're also ready to react to the extent that we end up in an environment with a little bit more volatility. We've got a lot of dry powder to be able to invest into that.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, the only thing I'd add is this isn't a new effort here. We've been focused on this for the last several years. So as we've been constructing portfolios, we've been doing it with the mindset that this could happen over time.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Michael Brown: Hi. Good morning, Scott, Rob, and Craig.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Michael Brown: I wanted to ask on the fee rates, I guess, typically on the Real Assets and Private Equity segments. So in Real Assets, it looks like the fee rate ticked up and it sounds like that was probably driven by a turn on of fees from the Global Infra Fund. Could you just maybe quantify that impact or maybe help us understand the right run rate for the go-forward? And then in Private Equity, it looks like the fee rate came down a little bit. Anything to point to there? And then can you remind us, are those K-Series products, are they on fee holiday? And if so, when does that end?
Craig Larson: So I'll try and take that a piece, maybe start with the last piece. Some of our K-Series products do have a bit of a fee holiday that's baked in depending on the product. And so that's a little bit of what you're seeing in Private Equity, but I think the Private Equity fee rates come down a couple of basis points over the past three quarters. The other thing to factor in is our core private equity strategy, is that scale that's going to come in at a little bit of a lower fee rate as well. Real Assets, to your point, what you're seeing in particular is the turning on of Infra 5 in the third quarter which would have contributed. But I would say, more importantly, Mike, the right way to evaluate these types of trends is over a longer period of time, because there's a lot that can happen intra-quarter. And overall, we feel really good about our aggregate fee rates and how they've stood up even with the introduction of a number of new products that come in naturally at a little bit of a lower fee rate.
Michael Brown: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.
Craig Larson: Thanks a lot, Mike.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to capital markets, obviously, a very strong improvement. Obviously, Telecom Italia helped with that. But as we look into the fourth quarter, not sure to what extend you can give any color on the potential and whether that could be another strong quarter. I know 4.24 is not the run rate, but it could rival the next best quarter, which was 320 million -- 321 million [ph]. And it discover something that could potentially close in 4Q and give you fees. And I think also just North America I think was more than half or around half of the fees this time, so over $200 million. I think it was up from about $130 million. So was there anything especially lumpy in North America that was contributing to the third quarter?
Rob Lewin: Yes, sure. Brian, thanks for the question. Obviously, a really great quarter for us. And there's a lot of reasons for us to feel really positive about our capital markets business. And you would have heard us say this in the past. This is not the type of business that is great to evaluate on a quarterly basis. Certainly, as a senior leadership team, as we evaluate performance, it's much more on an annual basis. And maybe, as we talk about the future, it's instructive a little bit to go back in history a bit on this business. If you look at our capital markets business in 2021, we generated roughly $850 million of revenue. Now obviously the capital markets were buoyant through that 12-month period of time, but it was a record fee number for our business. Now if you look at 2022 and 2023, when capital markets were largely shut across that 24-month period of time, our capital markets business still generated $600 million of revenue, plus or minus, in each of those 2 years. Now, we're actually more proud of that performance, because I really do think it shows the durability of the franchise. And as you look at 2024, the year start off a little bit slower. You had some catch-up on activity. It's in part the reason why you saw a spike that happened through the third quarter. But as we look at the year in aggregate, our expectation is that we're going to be up 50%-ish plus or minus, relative to 2022 and 2023. So it should be a new record year for us on the capital markets side, assuming no deals we expect to close in Q4 don't end up getting pushed. But we're really constructive around that 4-year trajectory and journey, and it really helps inform our views of the future, both around the durability of the franchise in down markets, but really our ability to inflect up, continue to grow as KKR does more, continue to grow geographically. We've talked about the very big opportunity that we see existing between GA and our capital markets, structured finance team is working in partnership together, and I really do think our third-party capital markets business is a unique model and very differentiated approach to the market that will continue to market share over time. So we're, as you can tell, really constructive on the business, but it's not really the type of business that I think is great to evaluate quarter in, quarter out.
Brian Bedell: Fair enough. Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Michael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on your progress building out the climate strategy. Maybe you could talk about some of the steps you're taking to build that out, types of investments you're making in the portfolio, what sort of return targets you're looking at, and how do you sort of envision expanding this strategy over the next several years. It seems like there could be opportunities across asset classes and clearly across the globe. So just curious, your thoughts there, thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Mike, it's Craig, why don't I start? Thanks for asking about. Look, there's a massive need for capital here. And so if the physical economy, excuse me, is going to align with the net zero pathway by 2050, like the capital needs are massive, $200 trillion, so think about that. That's $7 trillion annually of required investment for the next 25 plus years. And it's renewable certainly, but it extends far beyond that. It's energy, it's transportation, it's building, it's agriculture. And in our view, when you look at the capital that's been formed to date, it almost feels barbell. So on the one hand, you have lots of climate strategies that are dedicated to core power and renewables. So the very mature part of that framework, or climate technology, the very early stage. And so, in our view, there's a real sweet spot between these two extremes. And at the same point in time, it lends itself very well with our experience and the things that we've been doing as a firm in infrastructure, in particular, for 15 years now. So, it's become a front-burner topic for us. We're at $2.5 billion round numbers. We're continuing to fundraise. It's a very front-burner topic for our team, so more to come here over time, but we think this does have an opportunity to, yes, become an opportunity for us that can move the needle in the long-term in the framework of our program [ph].
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please proceed.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a question on GA. Just given some of the recent shifts in the macro environment and given timing dynamics with deploying the significant capital you've taken in over the past few quarters, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the glide [ph] path to getting back to the 14% to 15% pre-tax ROE target, and is 2026 still the right timing for that?
Rob Lewin: Hey, Kyle, thanks a lot for the question. At the most important level, which is how we're performing across the enterprise, how we're going out and sourcing low-cost simple liabilities at scale, how we're taking those liabilities and then putting them to work, we feel like we're operating at a really high-level. And so as we think about our ability to generate meaningful ROE and ultimately operating earnings for our shareholders, I know that we continue to be on a really great path. And the question as to how we operate and at what level of ROE is going to depend on a whole number of factors that we're watching, which including how quickly we grow and in what kind of way that we grow. Let's take our institutional business as an example. We've talked about the block business. We've been really active, have found some really exciting opportunities, as you know, Q4 and Q1 of this past year, but to work a material amount of capital. Now in those transactions, we underwrite IRRs to 12 to 18-month redeployment periods. So you're taking on the full cost of those liabilities, but not yet generating the full asset return for some period of time priced into the IRRs, which we think are really attractive but not going to come through operating earnings initially. So I think there's multiple different things that will impact your question, but you've followed us now for some time. I think you know that as a management team, we're always going to lean in around upfront investment for longer term gain. And so as we think about the long-term ROE for this business, undoubtedly, we continue to feel like 14% to 15% pre-tax, right level to model going forward. But at the same time, we don't have a specific timeline that's going to depend on these variables that we went through. But we do feel really great how our teams are working together, and no doubt it's been elevated since we bought 100% earlier this year.
Kyle Voigt: Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed.
Benjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the sale out of the core private equity portfolio. In the past, you've indicated that those were really businesses you wanted to own for a very long time and let their earnings compound. So could you talk about the circumstances that led to that sale? To what extent what might that be something that recurs? And then on the other hand, I think the comments for your longer term kind of dividend income expectation was predicated on -- I think the near-term it's predicated on the existing portfolio, but longer term you assume kind of more additions. So I guess kind of both sides, the circumstances of the recent sale, how you think about monetizing other assets and then how you think about kind of deploying capital and adding assets to that portfolio. Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Yes, great. Thanks a lot for the question. So we're always going to be focused on portfolio optimization, so it's possible that you could see some names come in and out of the portfolio over time. But the overall plan of long-term holds within our strategic holding segment is unchanged. As it relates to FiberCop specifically, this was a portfolio company that we actually owned in partnership with Telecom Italia. And so when we closed on our much broader transaction with Telecom Italia in July, we ended up cleaning up the capital structure and the legacy holding ended up getting cashed out. So that's why you see the monetization flow through in Q3 of this year. As it relates to our guidance, the $300 plus million of operating earnings by 2026, $600 plus million by 2028, and $1 billion plus by 2030, if anything, our conviction level as a management team and our ability to achieve those numbers has only gone up since we initially provided that guidance in the first last November and then updated at our Investor Day in April.
Benjamin Budish: Okay, got it. Thank you very much.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Ben.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on both the capital markets and the GA opportunity. Just curious, given the strength you just posted in the third quarter, how much GA contributed or a percentage of that activity? And how much is obviously still on the come as you build and integrate that business more?
Rob Lewin: I think the very short answer, Dan, is it was a solid contributor in the quarter, but not all that material in the context of $420 plus million of revenue. That said, we've talked about believing that the opportunity in that line of business for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars over time, and that perspective is unchanged.
Daniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come -- again from the line of Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Michael Brown: Great. Thank you for taking my follow-up. I wanted to follow-up on the wealth channel discussion earlier in the call. I guess, China is getting more focused as the potential opportunity for private assets in the retirement or DC channel, and maybe perhaps the more near-term opportunity would actually be model portfolios. But I guess, understanding that's kind of all largely unknown today, but I'm interested to hear about what's that long-term opportunity for KKR? How important is it to be a first mover into 401ks? And is partnership integral for success here? I'm just kind of curious if, the partnership you have with Capital Group could actually give you a bit of a leg up here. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hi. Hey, Mike. It's Craig. Thanks for asking about it. Look, so the majority of new dollars going into 401k plans are going through target date [ph] funds. I believe that percentage is north of 60% and we've talked to some participants who've indicated that percentage is actually well north of 60%. And at the same time, you probably won't be surprised to hear that we think there's a lot of industrial logic to introducing alternative strategies into target date strategies as individuals invest behind their continued retirement. So we expect that's where you'll see alternative strategies first introduced. It's a massive market. It's one that we do view as being a really interesting long-term opportunity for KKR in the industry. And you're correct. Remember, we've got our partnership with Capital Group. We've got a big target date fund business. And don't forget about GA here. Annuities, we think, are also going to be very relevant within the framework of these pools over time as well. So look, it's a topic that has mind share at our firm. There's no question about that, but it's going to take some time. So I don't think you need to adjust your Q4 '24 fundraising numbers for us. But yes, over time we do think this is a driver that will feel very tangible in the framework of our firms as well as our industry.
Michael Brown: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: And the next question will come again from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.
Patrick Davitt: Thanks for the follow-up. A quick housekeeping item. Did you give the updated visible realization pipeline numbers, please?
Rob Lewin: Yes, of course, Patrick. So we've got a pretty good amount of visibility into Q4 right now. So call it plus or minus $500 million of monetization-related revenue. Again, that consists of revenue that has already happened or revenue that has signed up and we feel really confident will end up closing. Importantly, and this is a little bit different in Q4 of '24. If you look at that $500 million, approximately 60% of that will come through our P&L at the lower 10% to 20% compensation ratio. So the flow through to our P&L will be more significant in Q4 as a result of that dynamic. Obviously, we're also only a month into the quarter, and so hopefully the markets maintain the constructive posture and we're able to generate some additional monetization-related revenue through the remainder of '24.
Patrick Davitt: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line -- again will come again from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Bill Katz: Great. Thanks very much for the extra question as well. Just thinking through your commentary on the capital markets opportunity, can you remind me just the split between how much of the revenues come from deployment as you continue to scale geographically across the segments versus exit activity? And given the 70% plus FRE margin, should we presume that that related revenue effectively drops to the bottom line. Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Bill, thanks for the question. We've put some charts up there and some past presentations around the correlation between deployment and our capital markets revenue. That's going to be the largest driver of our business. I would think about the regional expansion of capital markets, particularly in Asia, as upside for what we can create over time as well. Historically, the third-party part of our business has been roughly 20% of our revenue. In 2024, it's a little bit less than that. Really the result of the mid-market sponsor community being a little bit more quiet on the deployment side, but we do expect that to come back, and again, feel really good about our market share. On the topic of margins, this is an important one for us, clearly. What I've said historically is that we feel we could sustainably operate in that mid 60% FRE margin range, which is industry leading. But what I've also said is that's not a cap for us. And if we're able to go out and execute on our business plan, which we've got a lot of confidence we're going to be able to do, it's really all about scaling things that we've already started. And so we believe that we're going to be able to grow our revenue at a materially higher pace than our headcount or the operating complexity that's required to operate KKR. And so the output of that should be, if we're successful here, additional operating leverage and an expansion of what is already industry-leading FRE margins. And as you saw the spike in revenue in Q3, you would have seen that flow through.
Bill Katz: Thank you again.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: And the last question will come again from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a quick one on the monetization pipeline coming into 2025. We had an exchange this morning that was also saying the pipeline is very strong, but they did expect 1Q to be slow sort of seasonally. So just wondering if you're seeing that same situation for IPOs coming into '25, because I think you were talking about obviously the deployment momentum picking up, and then I guess maybe just the potential mix of the IPO market versus sales to other companies for monetization.
Rob Lewin: Sure. Maybe let's just talk broadly about the monetization environment, which we feel has really recovered through 2024. The backup here is pretty positive. You've had a period of really sustained strength in the leveraged finance market, which is to us as big a leading indicator as there is. Obviously fixed income spreads have come way in and the equity markets are as strong as they have been. The one area of the capital markets that has been a little bit more sluggish is the IPO market, but we do expect that to change over the coming quarters. I think just looking at our own portfolio, if you look back over the past 12 months, we've had four IPOs of size, and they include businesses in different sectors and different geographies, a growth-oriented business, some mature businesses that are slower growth. And it's just a very small data point, obviously, but all those IPOs are trading well above issued price, and on average they're trading close to 50% above their issued price, and as one of the probably largest equity issuers in the marketplace, that's, while a small data point, I think a helpful one as we think about what the IPO market could look like through 2025.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Brian, is we did see the deal market rebound in the first half, took probably the first 6 months to gain momentum to start to come back. So we're seeing, and there's a lot of discussion about the IPO market, which I think is highly relevant, but we're seeing that momentum continue. It's not just IPOs, but it's strategic M&A as well. But there's nothing that we're looking at today. We don't look at this by quarter per se. That would cause us to think there's an air pocket coming. As the guys referenced, the portfolios mature. It's been performing well. If anything, because a bunch of our industry did not sell things last year, there's a pent-up supply of exits coming.
Brian Bedell: Yes. That's right. That's right. That's right. I anticipated. Great. Thank you so much.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: I just would like to thank everybody for your continued interest in KKR. Please follow-up with us directly, of course, if you have any questions. Otherwise, look forward to chatting with everybody again in 90 days or so. Thanks so much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So first beginning with our results for the second quarter, we are pleased to be reporting fee related earnings of $0.84 per share, the highest we reported in our history and 25% above the figures we reported one year ago. And adjusted net income of $1.09 per share is up approximately 50% compared to one year ago. Going into a little more detail, management fees in the quarter were $847 million. This is up 13% year-over-year, driven by the breadth of our fundraising activities alongside a pickup in deployment. Capital markets transaction fees were strong in the quarter at $192 million, mainly from activity in new and existing portfolio companies within private equity and infrastructure, as well as an overall improvement in both the debt and equity capital markets backdrops. Fee related performance revenues in the quarter were $37 million. This was the first quarter our offshore K-Series vehicles earned their annual incentive fee given their launches about a year ago. The fee related performance revenue figure includes our infrastructure vehicle while to be clear, our performance allocation on our private equity vehicle is reflected in our realized performance income line item that is below fee related earnings. Fee related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range, which as a reminder is 17.5%. Other operating expenses came in at $158 million. So in total, FRE was $755 million and our FRE margin came in at 68%. Insurance operating earnings were $253 million in Q2 and strategic holdings operating earnings were $41 million in the second quarter as we continued to track towards our expected $300 million plus of net dividends by 2026. Importantly, we're continuing to see consistent growth across the underlying businesses. KKR's share of these businesses as of the first quarter, so on a one quarter lag basis, LTM revenues were $3.6 billion and EBITDA was approximately $900 million or so, with 14% and 12% like-for-like growth in revenue and EBITDA year-over-year respectively. So altogether, total operating earnings were $1.17 per share. As a reminder, total operating earnings equals our fee related earnings together with insurance and strategic holdings operating earnings. This quarter, total operating earnings represents over 80% of pretax adjusted net income. So said differently, over 80% of our pretax earnings this quarter were driven by our more recurring revenue streams. Turning to investing earnings, realized performance income was $482 million and realized investment income was $139 million. This was driven by secondary and strategic sale activity across a number of asset classes, including private equity infrastructure, as well as across multiple geographies pointing to the maturity and the diversity of our business. So, in aggregate adjusted net income was $972 million, or the $1.09 per share figure I mentioned a moment ago. Moving to investment performance on Page 10 of our earnings release, the traditional private equity portfolio appreciated 4% in the quarter and 18% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 1 in the quarter and up 3 in the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform well, up 3% in Q2 and up 17% LTM. And in credit, the leveraged credit composite was up 2, and the alternative credit composite was up 3 in Q2. And over the past 12 months, performance here was 12% for both strategies. And given this investment performance, our gross unrealized carried interest balance increased to $7.1 billion and that is up over 40% from Q2 of 2023. And finally, before turning over to Rob, we wanted to reflect for a moment on an exciting milestone as KKR entered the S&P 500 Index in June. We believe this is a strong reflection and endorsement of the firm's performance, our people and our culture, and we want to thank and recognize everyone at KKR for the creativity, innovation and focus that got us to where we are today and will continue to propel us going forward. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Given the recent S&P 500 inclusion, we expect that there are many on the call listening for the first time. Welcome. We would encourage you to also take a look at our April Investor Day replay and presentation that is found on our website. We feel as good as ever to hit our 2026 guidance figures that we introduced in April. As a reminder, those include $300 billion plus of new capital raised over the course of 2024 through 2026 and in terms of our financial metrics by 2026, $4.50 plus cents per share of FRE, $7 plus per share of total operating earnings and between $7 and $8 of adjusted net income per share, which is after tax. So looking at the LTM figures that we reported this morning, our 2026 guidance implies a 20% annual growth rate, plus or minus across all three of these key financial metrics. Overall, our activity levels and the momentum across the firm feel very strong. We are continuing to see our management fees scale meaningfully with 13% year-over-year growth, and this is before our in-market flagship funds have turned on. We are also seeing continued real signs of the monetization backdrop improving as evidenced by our Q2 realized performance fees and investment income. Last quarter I mentioned that we had very healthy pipelines on the back of the improved environment as well as our diversified and performing portfolio. I will echo those same comments again this quarter.
OneStream: Turning to strategic holdings, we've only reported this segment on a standalone basis for two quarters, but we remain confident in our ability to take the business to over $1 billion of operating earnings by 2030. Stepping back I don't think there are a lot of corporates giving seven-year guidance, so I think this really does speak to our confidence in both the durability and growth orientation of these cash flows. Now, turning to insurance, there are a lot of really positive developments this quarter, so I wanted to spend a bit of extra time taking you through a number of business building initiatives. In Q2, we saw record volume of inflows from Global Atlantic across annuity sales and flow reinsurance totaling over $8 billion in the quarter, compared to less than $3 billion just a year ago. And looking at the last four quarters in aggregate, total inflows including block activity have been over $50 billion. That's the highest point in any 12-month period in GA's history. On the earnings front, we continue to feel good about our ability to generate 14% to 15% pretax ROEs as the right long-term target. The ROE for Q2 came in below this range as a result of a couple of factors, but mostly a function of us leaning into the long-term opportunity at GA. The drivers for the quarter include elevated levels of liquidity from our big block reinsurance transactions, as well as the significant ramp up in quarterly volumes and some of the investments we are choosing to make that favor longer term ROEs, really at the expense of near-term ROEs. Overall, we continue to feel great about the long-term trajectory at GA and the opportunity for us to create significant value together. In particular, given that we are now six plus months into owning 100%, we thought we'd bring you through some tangible examples of how our closer collaboration across investments as well as capital markets are driving real business performance. First, in real estate, we recently closed on a $2 billion unlevered acquisition of a 5000 plus unit multifamily portfolio. Given the dearth of real estate, excuse me, of core real estate capital globally, we are seeing excellent risk return for the few very well capitalized buyers in the market of which we are one. We have conservatively priced this deal to an 8% unlevered return with significant upside potential, which we think is a really compelling risk adjusted return. But it's the type of deal that is going to put some pressure on our near-term ROEs for the benefit of longer term profitability. As an example, we expect the year one yield on this portfolio to be in the low 4% range, obviously less than where we are originating our liabilities today. But the combination of yields increasing over time and the expected appreciation of the asset make this a really interesting deal and one we're excited to pursue for the long-term. Now, there will naturally be a limit to how much of this type of investment that we want to make, but I think it's a really great example of our increased coordination between our real estate equity team and GA. We also have had a very positive development this quarter on the infrastructure side of our business. We announced an investment in Labrador Island Link, which is a transmission line that brings renewable energy to Eastern Canada. This is the first collaboration between Global Atlantic and KKR's infrastructure teams, who work together to structure the equity interest with significant downside protection. And finally, we wanted to take you through a brief case study from early Q3 that combines Global Atlantic, our credit teams, as well as our capital markets franchise. CyrusOne, a data center portfolio company of ours, has been growing rapidly with demand for hyperscale facilities continuing to increase driven by cloud and AI deployment. To support this growth, our capital markets team helped arrange an $8 billion facility of which we sole led the $3 billion institutional tranche that was anchored by Global Atlantic. Strategically, this represents a really exciting evolution in our playbook, where we generated a great outcome for a portfolio company, made a compelling credit investment, and were able to simultaneously drive capital markets fees. All of these examples would not have been possible without the interconnectivity across the firm and our model. We expect many more examples like this to come. Now before handing it off to Scott, I wanted to briefly touch on some of our operating metrics across the firm, where there continues to be very significant momentum. In the quarter we raised $32 billion of capital. This is the second most active fundraising quarter in our history. This is the second most active fundraising quarter in our history. Of particular note, we're very pleased with the initial reception of our global infrastructure V fund. Through July, approximately $10 billion of capital has been raised and in June we launched our Americas private equity flagship fundraise. So our fundraising super cycle is now well underway. Also, within private equity, our middle market strategy called Ascendant has already achieved its fundraising goal of $4 billion and we have not yet held its final close. It's a great outcome for a first time fund, obviously something that is adjacent and benefiting from our existing private equity team, and I think it really speaks to the receptivity of our investors to the quality of our team and our track record as we look to fundraise for our next flagship. Focusing for a moment specifically on private wealth, our K-Series vehicles in the quarter raised $2.8 billion of capital, 60% of which was driven by our private equity strategy. The K-Series suite has gained real momentum, but we are still in the earliest of days of what we view to be a really long-term strategic focus. As a reminder, we now have vehicles across our four key investing verticals. That's private equity, infrastructure, real estate, as well as credit, representing over $11 billion of AUM, and that's up from approximately $3 billion just a year ago. And looking beyond K-Series, we recently announced our exclusive strategic partnership with Capital Group, one of the largest global active asset managers. With $2.6 trillion of AUM and serving 67 million individual investors, Capital Group has built a leading client franchise with world class wealth distribution capabilities. By combining Capital Group's public market investing as well as distribution expertise with KKR's nearly 50-year track record in alternatives investing, we plan to introduce a series of hybrid public, private investment solutions that make the KKR platform available to a broader universe of investors. Importantly, the hybrid products are a step beyond what we are already doing with the K-Series and the accredited investor universe as they expand our reach to include the mass market. We're excited about the future of this collaboration, and we will share much more as we approach the product's expected launch in 2025. Turning to capital invested, we deployed $23 billion of capital in Q2. For the first half of 2024 we have now deployed $37 billion, which is almost double the first half of 2023. Real estate in particular had a strong deployment quarter across equity and credit. On the credit and liquid strategy side, direct lending continued to put capital to work as well as opportunities in high-grade ABF. Importantly, there remains a very healthy pipeline for deployment in the second half of 2024 as well. Overall, we remain very excited around the business momentum that we are seeing across the firm and how that can really translate into further P&L outcomes over the second half of the year. And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you Rob, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. Last month we held our annual meeting for our fund investors, followed by KKR's partners meeting. I thought while we were together today I would share some of the messages we shared in those sessions and some reflections from Joe and me on the first half of the year and our expectations for the second half. The main message we shared with our investors is that we are seeing significantly greater market activity since the beginning of the year. The macro inflation and rates backdrop has improved, markets are open and the deal market is back. To give you a sense, globally, year-to-date, leveraged credit issuance is up over 100%, IPOs are up nearly 15% and announced M&A is up approximately 25%. And given it typically takes a couple of quarters for the market to turn back on, these numbers understate the run rate activity we are feeling today. If this momentum continues, we believe you will see even more activity and announced deals and exits in the second half of the year. We are seeing this dynamic across our businesses. Deployment is up, monetizations are up, capital markets revenues are up, yield pipelines are up and visibility is high. Unless something happens to disrupt this momentum, we expect to see increased activity in the second half of this year relative to the first. What's also encouraging is that we believe this is a very attractive investment environment. Volatility and uncertainty are still with us. So far 2024 feels like it could be a sweet spot year where values are attractive and activity levels are high. This is in contrast to last year when values were attractive but transaction volumes were more muted as owners of mature assets didn't want to sell or finance them in a closed market. This year we not only have an open market, we have pent up supply of deals that didn't get done the last couple of years coming to market, so we are optimistic. A couple other things we shared in our June sessions, in private equity, while many in our industry over deployed in and around 2021, we did not. We have been applying the lessons we learned before and during the financial crisis and have been deploying in a linear fashion the last many years. As a result, we have strong returns, dry powder and a healthy portfolio. In credit we're seeing the benefits of a scaled $230 billion plus platform with significant opportunity across now a $40 trillion global credit space. Our private credit business is now over $100 billion and we continue to see attractive investing opportunities in asset based finance, Asia credit, opportunistic investing and junior debt amongst other areas. In infrastructure, the global opportunity is immense across our efforts in core, value add and climate. The capital need massively outstrips supply and we feel very well positioned. In real estate, the credit opportunity remains compelling with banks on the sidelines and the equity investment opportunity is very attractive. As a reminder, we started our real estate business in 2011. We don't have office and retail exposure of any consequence, so we have the ability to play offense in this environment and we believe we will take share over the next several years and will benefit from the current and coming dislocation. The real estate investment opportunity is highly compelling. We have closed or are under exclusive contract on over $10 billion of real estate equity deals since April 1 and have a full pipeline as some owners of real estate seek liquidity and sell their best assets. And in this environment, scale is trading at a discount. And we also introduced a fifth asset class to our investors in June, insurance. This is the ivy sidecar franchise that invests alongside the global Atlantic balance sheet in block and flow deals. This area has amongst the most compelling capital supply-demand imbalances we see across the firm. And speaking of GA, we're now roughly seven months since we became 100% owners. We've been focused on mining the untapped opportunities we shared with you last November when we announced the deal. As you heard, GA is growing rapidly and as we transition the business to 100% ownership, we're seeing the combined impact of simultaneous fast growth and investing in the business for the long-term. As we sit here today, we feel very optimistic about the opportunities to create value with GA at 100%, investing across more KKR asset classes, scaling KKR capital markets and structured assets, going global in particularly in Japan, and finding more ways to work together more broadly. Overall, the opportunity with GA is greater in our minds today than it was at the beginning of the year. So to keep it simple, the market is open, the firm is very active, our investment performance is particularly strong. We've never felt better about our team and we are well positioned to execute the plan we shared with you at our April Investor Day. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. My question is on GA's net investment income in your comments on long-term versus near-term ROEs. So given GA's investment portfolio yield that it's currently depressed because you have excess levels of liquidity that have yet to be deployed, how do you expect yields to improve as you fully deploy the excess liquidity and over what timeline?
Rob Lewin: Hey Craig, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start out and there's a couple of things going on, and maybe the shorter part of your answer is going to ultimately depend on what the growth is from here, but maybe let's talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the business. You referenced a lot of growth and just to put some numbers around that, if you look at the past nine months, we've taken on $50 billion of additional capital. That compares to $20 billion in the preceding nine months. And we're trying to be very thoughtful, as you can imagine, around deployment, as we're digesting that growth. We're also using new muscles inside of our firm as it relates to linking up our real estate equity team, our infrastructure team, our capital markets team and so there's a lot of really good work going on. And as a result, we've been operating at elevated levels of liquidity. And so just again, to put some numbers behind that, if you look at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $8 billion of cash. If you look a year ago, that number was closer to $4 billion and that doesn't even take into account a lot of the high-grade corporates that we have that are being weighted to be rotated into higher yielding assets. And I think the other point that I think is worth talking about, as we think about what the medium term net investment income can look like and ROE could look like, is really this point I was trying to get at in the prepared remarks around us actively making investments today that we believe will generate meaningful long-term ROE, but that's coming at the expense of shorter term ROE. It's that core real estate example that I mentioned where day one, we expect running yields to be roughly 4%. If you think about where we're originating liabilities today, that's north of 5% and so not only are those investments not accretive to our near-term P&L, they're actually dilutive. But for those who have followed us a while, been shareholders with us for a long time, I think they'll know that we're always going to make the decision to take some pain on short-term P&L for long-term earnings power. And so it's tough to then extrapolate from there exactly what that's going to mean to near-term ROEs and returns as a lot of that is a function of the growth that we expect. But as we look forward, we look at Q3 and Q4, our expectation is we'll have operating earnings that are in and around where we are in Q2. And as we think about how we ramp up into 2025, my expectation is we're probably based on the growth we see in front of us, we're probably operating at a level that's a little bit below our 14% to 15% long-term ROE range. But again, all in service for that long-term growth that we feel across the KKR platform and that we believe pretty strongly will benefit GA's long-term P&L.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks, Craig.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Next question, Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Bill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. So many questions, but in so little time. Just in terms of volume, so you reiterated the $300 billion, you're certainly well on your way to that. You launched, you got the first close in on Global V, and V is great and you mentioned that you sort of now in the market for the North America fund. I was wondering if you could just sort of comment about what you're hearing from the LPs on demand across the asset classes? And then maybe tie that into Asia, when that might start to come into the market as well? Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Bill, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. There are a couple things. One is just broader context for you. I know there tends to be a lot of focus on the flagship funds, but if you go back and think about what's been going on with the firm, even go back to the beginning of 2022, so call it the last two and a half years, we raised $214 billion. Only $14 billion of the 214 was in flagships. So happy to chat about the flagships, but we should also keep in mind the vast majority of the activity that we've been generating has been outside of that and to your point, we now have the flagships coming back as well. The overall tone in the fundraising market continues to improve. I think it kind of depends on where you are and what you're talking about. So let's just talk about asset classes. Infrastructure and private credit, we continued to see investors very interested and trying to catch-up to the allocations that they have made. So it continues to be quite a bit of activity in those asset classes. I would also include real estate credit in that area. It's kind of a similar theme to private corporate credit. Then you kind of move on into real estate equity, where I think the sentiment is shifting a bit right now. There has been more caution, no doubt. Our perspective is that the sentiment has bottomed in the last year. Valuations have bottomed in the first half of this year, and as you heard in the prepared remarks, we've been quite active deploying into real estate equity. I'd say the fundraising is going to lag that reality a little bit, but we're starting to have more conversations with investors that understand, although it may be perceived as a bit contrarian, this is a really good time to invest in real estate equity. And then in private equity activity is picking up. As you heard, monetizations are up and deployment is up. People are starting to get more money back, so those with more mature programs are starting to see some of that. I think you'll see more of that as we get into the latter half of the year. We have just launched our flagship U.S. private equity funds. There's not a lot to report as of yet. I'll let Craig give an update on our Ascendant strategy, which is a recent data point in a minute. But it feels to us like there's a decent chance the private equity fundraising environment has bottomed as well and you'll start to see sentiment shift to the positive. More broadly, as you know, private wealth, big opportunity for us all upside. Insurance companies we thought might pull back from us a little bit as rates went up, have not seen that, actually are seeing as much activity and momentum in insurance as we've seen in a while. And so we do think there's quite a bit of activity. Sorry for the long answer, but hopefully it gives you a sense that there's a variety of different things happening underneath the surface. And on private equity, Craig, why don't you just give the latest data point we have? It's not a big one, but it's at least indicative.
Craig Larson: Sure. Hey Bill, thanks for the question. So, as you heard from Rob in our prepared remarks, we've made what we feel is some great progress on Ascendant. That's our middle market private equity strategy, first time vehicle for us. As of June 30, we're at $4.1 billion. We have a $4.6 billion hard cap there, and we're in a pretty advantageous spot at the moment. We're oversubscribed at that hard cap. And so to be clear, we are turning away clients that want to begin final diligence there. And for some of those clients, through final diligence, we're cutting back on allocations. So the backdrop is one that feels constructive there. Again, far too early to try to lead through those dynamics as it relates to North America $14 billion [ph], but again, thought that would also be a helpful data point.
Rob Lewin: And Bill, just one other thing from me, maybe two quick, because I know there's a lot of interest in the fundraising environment. We are continuing to see a couple of other themes. One is concentration of relationships. So we're finding more investors want to do more with fewer partners, and so we're continuing to see that trend accelerate. Also, I think there's increased recognition of what we've been talking about for the last decade, plus the power of portfolio construction, deployment, pacing and tools to add value. And you're going to see much higher dispersion of results, I think and we'll figure out who did a good job the last five years and we feel really well positioned in that context.
Bill Katz: Thank you.
Operator: Next question, Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. So, I wanted to start with a question around the outlook for deployment. You mentioned it a number of times that the pipelines look pretty robust and you've announced a handful of deals as well. So when we think about private equity in particular, as you deploy this capital, how are you thinking about utilization of direct lending markets versus syndicated markets over the coming several quarters? And on the flip side, I guess, what does that mean for your own direct lending business as you're navigating this environment where syndicated bank loan market seems to be back in kind of full force? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I start? So first, just as it relates to private equity, and you would have seen some of this in the page in our press release, we are have a very healthy backlog of traditional private equity investments. Feels like in the second half of the year, we're going to continue to see an acceleration of activity there, which is great to see. I think on your point on the syndicated versus the direct lending of private debt markets, it just provides optionality. When we think back, or when we all think back to a year ago in the syndicated debt markets were closed, I think we saw M&A volumes, honestly be pretty modest. And as Scott had mentioned, we were very constructive on risk reward. But with many of those financing markets effectively shut in the syndicated markets in particular, it just led to a reduced level of activity. So I think it's actually very helpful in terms of private equity deployment, honestly, in terms of private debt deployment and the outlook to have a very healthy syndicated debt market. But we'll be able to, from again, a PE standpoint, it gives us the flexibility to think through what we think the right solution is in the framework of that particular investment. So I think with a private debt hat on, you may see a smaller market share versus those environments where the syndicated debt markets are really volatile. But you'll see overall volumes be a lot higher.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Alex, it's Scott. I think that's well said. We use both. It depends on the circumstance and the deal. The way I think about this is last year the deal volumes were so muted. It was quite a bit of focus on how large a share the private credit market had. This is one of these environments where it becomes clear that a smaller share of more pie can still be more pie. And so that's how I would think about it.
Operator: Next question, Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. Could you give us an update on the K Series distribution rollout and to what extent you can give specifics on any large platforms coming online with certain products over the next few quarters. And then more broadly, any update or thoughts on plans to add new products to the suite? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Patrick, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? And just to step back to level set for everyone, as of June 30, we had around $75 billion of assets under management from individuals, and that number does not include policyholders at Global Atlantic. So if anything, that would understate our presence as you think about the breadth of activities that we have. Now most of that capital is from high net worth and ultrahigh net worth individuals and family offices that are invested directly in our funds and strategies. And over time, we've tended to see teens percentage of our new capital raise come from individuals. So it's been a healthy part of our fundraising. Now, most recently, again is, I know you know wonderfully well, we've introduced our K Series suite of products. These are the funds and strategies that are designed and tailored specifically for that wealth market. So we have K-Infra and KIF for the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on infrastructure. Similarly, we have U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on private equity, private BDCs also. And then we also have additional real estate and credit vehicles. And so of that $75 billion, around eleven are from these K-Series suite of products. And a year ago that was three. So we're in the early days, but we feel really good about our progress. And I think that's particularly true in infrastructure as well as in private equity, which are newer asset classes here. And it feels like we have an opportunity as a first mover. Now in terms of ramp and pace at the end of 2023, we mentioned that we were raising about $500 million a month. In Q1, we raised $1.8 billion, so we were at $600 million a month. Q2 we raised $2.8 billion, so $900 million a month or thereabouts. So it seems like reception and interests and momentum feels really good. We don't have a specific update in terms of number of platforms, but to be clear, we do expect the number of platforms where we're present to increase over the coming months and quarters. I think that's going to be particularly true in terms of the private BDC, which is the youngest of those, of those products for us. So it feels like great progress. And again, I wouldn't take the eye away from the prize like we do think the more interesting point here is really that long-term secular opportunity, mass affluent individual investors have not had an easy way to access alts over the coming years. We do expect an opportunity for trillions of dollars of assets to flow into these products. And given our brand, our track record, and the investments we've made in distribution and marketing, it just feels like we're really well positioned to continue to be a winner. And our strategic partnership with Capital Group, as we touched on in our prepared remarks, just increases this opportunity set. So hopefully that's helpful.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Patrick, it's Scott. Just a couple of quick additions. The platform rollout is kind of at or slightly ahead of our expectations. And it takes a while once you get on a platform to have it really kick in and work and train the advisors and the sales team. So I'd say really pleased with the progress, but the kind of capital raising power isn't embedded yet in the numbers that Craig walked through. To your question on new products, we don't have anything new to announce on the K-Series front today, but in the prepared remarks, we did mention our Capital Group partnership. As a reminder there, we're creating hybrid product in partnership with Capital Group. We announced two credit products that we're going to launch in the first half of next year together. But to be clear, that is not the extent of the vision. We expect to roll out hybrid products across the other parts of the alternative space as well with our partner. So more to come on that over the next few quarters.
Operator: Next question, Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Pease go ahead.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So I just wanted to build upon that on the Capital Group partnership. If you could maybe talk about the context and the background of how you came to choosing each other in terms of the partner. And then you just mentioned a couple of products next year and then kind of the longer term vision. So I think you've said previously that you're not looking to have a whole suite of products out there for the retail market, but so curious as how you're going to differentiate between the K Series and the Capital Group partnerships and what you think a more mature product lineup looks like?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Dan. I'll take a crack. How did it come together? A Capital Group called us and they had been thinking about how they wanted to participate in the alternative space. And if you go back to, I think, the original press release that our partner, Mike Gitlin did a really nice job laying out how they thought about it. Should they acquire something? Should they partner? Should they buy pieces of different businesses? And they decided that partnering was the best act. So, to be clear, they called us. We spent quite a bit of time together, got to know each other really well as firms and as people. And I think the reason this came together is the reason most things come together, just an extraordinary cultural fit. We thought about the world the same way, same focus on delivering value for all the clients counting on us and understanding, really who we work for. So that's how it came together. It was kind of a joint vision and shared values and how we see the world in terms of kind of where we're going and how this is different. So one simple way to think about it, let's just take the U.S. market. And the numbers are never precise, but to be close enough, with our K Series, we're targeting the accredited investor and the qualified purchaser. That's roughly 5%, give or take, of U.S. households. I'm close, but it's single-digits, mid-single-digits percent, depending on what you look at. That means there's 95% of U.S. households that it does not access. And so what we're doing with Capital Group is creating a product that will allow the other 95% of households to participate in what we do. In its simplest form, that's what we're doing. So it's hybrid. So there's going to be an element that is going to be the liquid strategies that will be managed by Capital Group and then a portion that is the private market strategies that will be managed by us. So think of all of these products as having a component of both and geared toward that broader audience, that mass market. As I said, we're starting with credit. So think of it as a component of liquid credit plus private credit. And for us, that will include both direct lending and asset based finance in the private credit sleeve. And then for the other products that we're talking about launching, infrastructure, private equity, real estate, we're in the design phase. So I would expect over time, I'm not going to put a timeframe on it today, but over time, you will likely see products from us together across all of those areas. And so that's how we expect it to play out over the coming years. But we'll keep you posted, but hopefully that helps.
Daniel Fannon: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next question, Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Yes, lots of questions to ask. Maybe if I can wrap in a two-part here on the capital markets that you talked about for the third quarter being elevated. Is there any Telecom Italia lumpiness in that? And do you see the environment for your capital markets fees improving as we move into the end of the year, given the pent-up demand that you were talking about? And then just if I can squeeze in an FRE margin question, the incremental margin on capital markets, obviously, I think being, well, maybe you can comment, is that above your overall FRE margin, therefore accretive? And do you see the 68% as sort of a peak.
Scott Nuttall: Right, thanks Brian. Good morning. So as it relates to capital markets, you're right, that Telecom Italia transaction closed July 1. We will generate a meaningful capital markets fee as part of being involved multiple different aspects of that transaction. But I would tell you, as I look at our broad-based capital markets pipeline, I think pipelines for that business are certainly good one quarter out, but probably two quarters. As I look at that back half of the year, I tell you that our aggregate pipeline is as good as we've ever seen it. And that includes 2021, when we generated roughly $850 million of revenue or capital markets business. So we're quite encouraged around what the back half of the year could look like. Again these are pipelines. They're forward indicators. A lot of stuff needs to come to fruition, but it is broad-based. It's across debt, it's across equity. It's U.S., Europe, Asia. It's also third party. So we're feeling really good about what the back half of the year could look like. As it relates to FRE margin, I would say absolutely. In an elevated capital markets quarter, you are going to see higher FRE margin the flow through is just higher, given our operating expenses are more fixed in nature relative to that incremental capital markets revenue. Here's how I've described our FRE margin in the past. I believe that today we can operate sustainably in the mid-60s on FRE margin basis across the firm, and that includes in most market environments, but that is definitely not the cap for us. And if we're successful with the business model that we've got a lot of conviction in here as a management team. We're going to scale our revenue. We're going to scale our fees at a pace that's meaningfully above our headcount growth and our operating complexity across the firm. And we would expect more margin expansion in the future if we're successful. So hopefully that gives you some color on the back half of the year and what we're feeling in capital markets and how that might translate into FRE margin.
Brian Bedell: Super helpful. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Next question, Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.
Brian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you have $215 billion of carry eligible, 81 that's above cost and accruing carry. Would be great to get an update on how much this has grown over the past year, specifically on the heels of strong performance and then as you continue to deploy capital? And then is there a way to think about the breakdown of this AUM by vintage? How much is less than a few years old versus how much is older than that? I'm just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the step up and accrued performance fees and ultimately realizations over the next couple of years.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, thanks, Brian, and let me take a shot at that. And we don't break out the vintage, but we could tell you that our, we've spent a lot of time around linear deployment as a firm, and so, feel good that as you look back over the past seven or eight years, you're going to find a healthy level of dispersion across different vintages. I think that to me, the metric that I look at as the best forward indicator, honestly, is the simplest one, and that's our gross accrued carried interest, that today on our balance sheet is roughly $7.1 billion. If you look back just two quarters ago, that number was $6 billion. So in an environment where we've actually been realizing a little bit more carry than we were expecting to realize, those are pretty healthy levels of step ups across the firm. And I think paints a pretty good picture for what the forward could look like as it relates to monetization related revenue book carried interest. But also we feel good about how investment income might ramp from here as well.
Brian McKenna: Helpful. Thanks, Scott.
Rob Lewin: Just one additional statistic there, and this is not going to tie to your question specifically on the capital that is above cost and accruing carry, but just to look at the private equity portfolio as a whole and give you a sense, well over 50% of that, when we look at our remaining fair value, is marked at 1.5 times cost or greater. And roughly 30% of that capital dollars is at roughly 30% of that, excuse me, is marked at two times cost and greater. So I think one of the things that our team talked about at Investor Day, Pete and Nate, was this approach we've had on linear deployment. I think that has really served us well in terms of having a more mature portfolio. And I think some of the discipline that you've seen and how we've invested capital over the last several years, and honestly, lessons that we learned dating back to the GFC have an opportunity to really pay us dividends in the years ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Next question, Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Given a lot of color around the capital markets outlook going into Q3, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the visible pipeline in terms of realizations and along the same lines. Could you talk about the $500 million in expected realization revenues thereabouts? What ended up shaking out better than you expected for Q2? Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Thanks, Ben. I'll hand it above. Let me start with just visibility around monetizations for Q3. It's at a pretty healthy level. We are plus or minus 500 million of monetization related revenue for Q3. That is either that has either happened or from deals that are signed up that we expect to close this quarter. Just breakdown wise, that's roughly 60% carry and 40% investment income. So that pipeline is better today than it's been in quite some time. And then your question as it relates to the end of quarter press release we put out on our monetization update. You know that I think that press release went out around June 20. We give our best estimate and view of the quarter at that time. And of course things can happen in the next 10 days. And we had a few things that ended up on one side of the quarter versus the other. But I wouldn't say anything necessarily significant in size. One thing that was significant size, a few things that that added up to create the delta that you're referring to between where we landed, which is a bit over $600 million, and that June 20 press release that I believe stated we were at greater than $500 million through that point in time.
Benjamin Budish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Chubak: Good morning. So wanted to squeeze in just another question on cap markets, but I want to look at it with a longer term lens. It is something I pressed you guys on in the past, but just given the pipeline strength, sponsor recovery still feels like it's in the early stages. You expect to at least monetize the 100% GA ownership better. You're certainly going to see significant franchise growth over the next few years relative to the prior cycle peak. How would you frame what the capital markets trajectory for revenues might look like? Is there a way to maybe size what, under a normalized lens or by 2026, what you think the fee generation potential could be of that business?
Rob Lewin: Thanks, Steven. I'm not going to give you a number. We haven't given a number in the past, but let me try and frame it. In 2021, we did 850 million of revenue. Now the capital markets were pretty buoyant in 2021, but when you look at KKR and our platform, we do so much more across the firm. We think the opportunity to expand from a geographic perspective as the Asia capital markets mature is one that's very meaningful. That's both across Asia Pac, but also in Japan. And we're building for that effort. We're doing a lot more on the equity side of our business and the structured debt side of our business in combination. As you said with Global Atlantic, we've talked about that being a couple hundred plus million dollar revenue opportunity in its own right. And I really believe that our third-party capital markets business is going to continue to take share. We just have a very differentiated model in how we're approaching corporates and sponsors that we see resonate with the market daily. And we think we're also in a position where we're able to continue to recruit and retain best-in-class professionals to both execute and distribute those capital markets transactions. And so while we're not going to give you sort of that number, I think we're painting a picture of a business that we think can grow meaningfully from the base that we're at today.
Scott Nuttall: It's a really good question, Steven. Maybe we should invite you to our budget meetings. But to Rob's point, we're working across more asset classes, doing more in Europe and Asia, third parties up GA, we think is hundreds of millions of dollars of potential a year as we get that right. And the other thing that I would point out is our portfolio is bigger across all these asset classes and maturing, which I think is at least as big a contributor as some of the other topics. So we're not going to give you a number, but if you're positing that it should be a lot more than it's been, I agree with you.
Steven Chubak: Well said. Thanks so much for taking my question.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Next question, Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Good morning. Just a question on infrastructure. I saw the recent partnership announcement with HASI on sustainable infrastructure projects. Seems like an interesting deal sourcing funnel. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on this partnership, how you view this strategically helping KKR, and then just more broadly on infrastructure. Just curious where you're seeing some of the most exciting opportunities right now for putting capital to work in the infrastructure space, and how you're thinking about other potential opportunities for other partnerships over time?
Craig Larson: Hey Mike, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question again. Much like Steven's question would echo a lot of the broad themes in your question on infrastructure, so I think as we think about the platform and how we're situated today, we're just really encouraged with our progress to date. Four years ago, AUM was around $15 billion. As of June 30, we were at $73, so $15 to $70, all organic. That's a CAGR of 50%. And while you've seen AUM grow meaningfully, you've also seen our deployment stats have increased pretty meaningfully. In for deployment in 2019 was $2 billion, 2020 was $2.2 billion. And over the trailing twelve months, we've invested eight. And then as our footprint increases again, back to the last topic, capital markets, the fee opportunity there increases as well. And the growth in innovation hasn't stopped here. So again, we're in the early days as it relates to infrastructure and private wealth. Climate, as you noted, is an adjacency where we think we can be really differentiated given our expense to date. Investing behind the energy transition and then finally again, flagship infrastructure is very front of mind for us as we think about opportunities. I think broadly as it relates to some of the areas where we're most constructive on investing, I do think as it relates to digital infrastructure in particular, and some of those opportunities in particular are ones that are very exciting for us if we think about our data center investment activity. And why don't I hang out there for a moment? It's been one of the core investment themes for several years, and we do believe we're really uniquely positioned to be a major player across the space given the combination of our capabilities, the number of pools where we can invest. And that's not just in data center, it's also in power generation, transmissions, renewables, technology, and then also capital markets plays a piece in this as well, as you heard from the CyrusOne example. So again, just to put some numbers around things, we have four independent data infrastructure platforms, one in the U.S., one in Europe, two in Asia Pacific. The global footprint here is one that's a real differentiator and we benefit from the connectivity. So depending on the risk reward, we've got multiple pools of capital that can be relevant. So just in this area alone, we have investments in infrastructure, Asian infrastructure, core, private equity, real estate, as well as our wealth strategies $5 billion of invested capital today with an active pipeline. And if anything, this would understate the size and scale of our footprint here. To give you a sense, if you looked at the total enterprise value on 100% owned basis and included a current investments, together with that secured and highly visible pipeline, you'd be north of $150 billion of enterprise value. So the opportunities that we have in an area like this is one that's really exciting. On the power side, we have 10 plus renewable developers in real estate. We're active in both real estate equity and credit. Our credit vehicles alone this year have evaluated over $10 billion of data center financing opportunities. That's developments stabilized as well as ABS and CMBS. And we can be relevant here both at the opportunistic end of the spectrum on one end and insurance on the other. And again, the capital markets team has also been active, you heard in our prepared remarks, the CyrusOne case study. So I think it's a great example of the thematic approach that we can bring. I think it's also a great example of the connectivity you can see across the firm and in our culture and how we're able to work across teams and across geographies.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Hey Michael thanks for the question. I think the two big themes to that part of your question I point to is digitalization. I think data centers; fiber, powers continue to be incredibly active across all of those areas. And if you look at recent deal announcements, you'll see that's a big theme. And then to Craig's point, it's energy transition, renewables climate. I think the HASI partnership that you referenced, I would think of that as a bit similar to what we've talked about in the past around our partnerships across asset based finance and real estate. And we have 35 platform partnerships there, the better part of 10,000 people out originating. So you'll continue to see us develop more relationships like that. It's in a similar vein.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Next question Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning and thank you. I heard what Scott said about the, flagship funds playing a lesser role, but I am curious kind of about the kind of expected base management fee dynamics that we should be expecting here in the next couple of quarters. So you raised $8 billion in Infra five, and you said it's up over 10, but there's still $7 billion left in Infra four. So does that, quote, turn on later in the year or is that a third quarter event? And kind of similarly with your next flagship private equity fund, you still have, I think, $8 billion left in the prior fund. So does that turn on, like, later maybe early, mid-2025? Is that kind of what we should be expecting?
Rob Lewin: Hey, Chris, it's Rob. So in the case of infrastructure, given some activity through the end of the quarter and with some deployment early in the quarter, we're actually turning on Infra five in Q3. So you'll start to see management fees flow through for Infra five starting this quarter as it relates to North America, 13 that you referenced in terms of capital still left to deployed, I think as of 630 we had today, but prior to 630. I think we had four announced but not yet closed transactions and so we would expect to be nearing the end. But we still have time to go of our investment period and that's why we've been out fundraising and launching for next four.
Chris Kotowski: And have you shared kind of the target size of those funds or is that confidential?
Rob Lewin: Yes. We have not, Chris.
Chris Kotowski: Okay, all right. Thank you. That's it from me.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Next question Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please go ahead.
Arnaud Giblat: Hey, good morning. A quick question on the opportunities to address the individual markets. I appreciate that you're doing a lot with K series and your capital agreement to go after distributing private market assets to individuals. I was just wondering if there was perhaps an opportunity to complement there through distribution or through the production and then distribution of secondaries. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Good question, Arnaud. So at this point, there might be an opportunity down the road, but it's nothing front and center for us in terms of the secondaries market. We spent time in that space. We've analyzed it, never say never, but it's not front and center part of how we're thinking about next step strategy at this stage. We think there's plenty to do candidly across the asset classes that we're in.
Arnaud Giblat: Got it. Thanks. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the floor over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: I would just like to thank everybody for your continued interest in KKR. We look forward to giving an update on next quarter in 90-days and if you have any additional follow-ups please reach out directly. Thank you again.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Partner and Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Thank you. You may begin. 
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.
 We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.
 We know many of you joined us for our 2024 Investor Day just 3 weeks ago. Thank you for spending the day with us. And for those of you who were unable to participate or are newer to KKR, we would encourage you to watch a replay of the webcast or review the Investor Day presentation and transcripts that are on the Investor Relations section of our website. There is a wealth of information, of course, across all of those materials.
 And as a reminder, before getting to the numbers themselves, starting with this quarter, our financial reporting reflects the previously announced segment and financial metric changes. Of particular note, first, we closed on the remaining interest in Global Atlantic on January 2, and we now own 100% of GA. Second, we're now reporting a new segment, Strategic Holdings. Third, we've introduced a new financial metric, total operating earnings, which consists of fee-related earnings plus insurance segment and Strategic Holdings operating earnings.
 Total operating earnings represents the more recurring and stable portion of our earnings and is a measure we look at to evaluate our performance as it reflects how our business model and how our financial profile has evolved. Our expectation is that total operating earnings should approximate 70% of pretax earnings over time. And finally, our Q1 financials reflect our revised compensation ratios, which deliver more FRE to our shareholders and drive even more alignment between our compensation model and the outcomes of our clients. And as a reminder, for additional details, we posted recash financials in late March.
 So now turning to Q1 and our headline financial metrics. Fee-related earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.75, that's up 22% compared to Q1 '23. Total operating earnings were $1.08 per share in the quarter. And adjusted net income per share, which is after tax, was $0.97, and that's up 20% year-over-year.
 Looking at our financials in a little further detail. Management fees in Q1 were $815 million. That's up 4% sequentially from last quarter. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $152 million, $116 million of which were generated from our Capital Markets business. Our fee-related compensation ratio was 17.5%, which is right at the midpoint of our target range.
 Other operating expenses were $145 million. You're seeing a continued focus on expense management. This number is down 4% compared to Q1 of 2023. But we expect this line item to increase modestly over the balance of the year, driven by continued investments in operations across KKR, alongside an increase in placement fees, given our active fundraising pipeline.
 So in total for the quarter, fee-related earnings were $669 million or the $0.75 per share I mentioned a moment ago. And our FRE margin came in at 68%. That margin figure is up 700 basis points compared to Q1 '23, and that's driven both by the change in our compensation framework as well as the strong expense management in the quarter.
 Insurance operating earnings were $273 million. There are really 2 things to point out here. First, portfolio yields this quarter reflect elevated cash and more liquid assets at GA, and that's largely due to 2 sizable recent transactions with the MetLife and Manulife blocks closing in Q4 '23 and  Q1 '24, respectively. So the full cost of those liabilities come on to the GA balance sheet at close, but it does take some time to redeploy those assets into our target portfolios. And that delay or that ramp is expected, of course, and is built into our pricing for each of these deals.
 And secondly, we're seeing attractive investment opportunities in asset classes like core plus real estate and infrastructure, as our origination capabilities are presenting GA with attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities. However, while these opportunities come with attractive long-term ROEs, near-term yields tend to be more modest.
 And moving to our new segment, Strategic Holdings. In Page 18 of the earnings release. Remember, the segment today consists of our direct interests in our core private equity portfolio, which is a long-duration investment strategy with an expected hold period of 10 to 15-plus years. So 19 businesses that are well diversified and generally have durable, defensive financial profiles alongside growing earnings.
 And looking at KKR's share of these businesses, 2023 revenues were approximately $3.6 billion, with EBITDA of $900-some-odd million. And given the maturing of the portfolio as well as the stability of operating performance, we anticipate these investments to be more regular dividend payers over time.
 So operating earnings in the quarter were $21 million, driven by dividend activity. As we stated previously, we expect Strategic Holdings' operating earnings to be more modest in 2024. However,  we expect that will change in a pretty significant way looking beyond '24, with operating earnings of $300-plus million by 2026, $600-plus million by 2028 and $1-plus billion by 2030. Our visibility and the opportunities we see here are highly differentiated looking across our space. So putting all of that together, total operating earnings were $1.08 per share.
 Moving to investing earnings. Realized performance income was $272 million and realized investment income was $135 million. This was primarily driven by secondary sales, strategic exits, and realized carry from the core private equity portfolio. So altogether, adjusted net income totaled $864 million or $0.97 per share.
 Turning to investment performance. You can see this on Page 10 of the earnings release. The private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and up 19% in the last 12 months. Opportunistic real estate was up 1% in the quarter as well as up 1% in the LTM. The infrastructure portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and is up 16% over the trailing 12 months. In credit in Q1, delevered at composite was up 3% and alternative credit composite was up 4%. And over the last 12 months, performance was plus 14% and plus 13%, respectively.
 And given performance in Q1, our gross unrealized carry interest balance increased to $6.9 billion at 3/31. That's up 16% from the end of 2023 and over 50% from Q1 of '23. And finally, consistent with historical practice and as we announced last quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.70 per share on an annualized basis or $0.175 per share per quarter, beginning with Q1. This is now the fifth consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure, increasing our annualized dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.70 over this period of time.
 And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob. 
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call this morning, and for the many of you that spent time with us at our Investor Day a few weeks back. I thought I would start this morning by going through some of our key operating metrics.
 During the quarter, we raised $31 billion of capital. That's almost $90 billion over the last 12 months. In just this quarter alone, we had attractive outcomes across each of our businesses. Our private equity and real asset businesses together raised $9 billion of capital across a number of strategies. And that's before any meaningful closes from our upcoming flagship raises. And our momentum in credit has really continued, with new capital raise totaling $21 billion, with most of the capital coming from our direct lending, asset-based finance and leveraged credit strategies.
 And looking more specifically at our K Series vehicles, we raised almost $3 billion year-to-date through April 1, primarily in private equity and infrastructure. We also launched a private BDC in the quarter and are starting to see some real inflows here as well.
 Turning to capital invested. We deployed $14 billion in the quarter. Deployment within private markets was largely driven by infrastructure as well as real estate equity. And over half of the capital invested in the quarter came from credit, primarily across asset-based finance and direct lending. We are seeing a significant ramp in credit deployment, reflecting the overall growth of our credit platform.
 Now looking forward to Q2, we expect there to be a healthy pipeline of new deployment given the activities we are seeing broadly across the firm. And over the course of the year, we do expect deployment to pick up meaningfully. 
  Before wrapping up this morning, I did want to spend a couple of minutes summarizing the key takeaways from our Investor Day a few weeks back. Scott and Joe led off our Investor Day with a very simple message: While we have experienced a lot of growth, it feels like we are just getting started.
 In terms of the key takeaways from the day. First, we provided medium-term guidance. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to be raising capital for over 30 strategies, including a number of our flagships. We expect to raise $300-plus billion of capital over the course of 2024 through 2026. In terms of our financial metrics, by 2026, we expect $4.50-plus per share of FRE. Implying a CAGR of approximately 20%, $7-plus of total operating earnings per share and $7 to $8 per share of adjusted net income, implying a CAGR of roughly 30%.
 Second, looking ahead, we feel quite confident in our longer-term trajectory. We expect $15-plus of adjusted net income per share in the next 10 years or less, with approximately 70% of these earnings to be more recurring in nature. Over the next 5 years, we also expect $25-plus billion of cash generation. We anticipate that this cash will get deployed across 4 key areas: core private equity, share buyback, strategic M&A and insurance. Our model really gives us the confidence across all of these avenues of deployment. In each case, we have a strong track record of being able to deploy capital against high ROE opportunities that also generate recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share.
 And number three, looking at our key themes, we made sure to highlight our diversified and purpose-built business model. Asset Management plus Insurance plus Strategic Holdings, all working synergistically together to generate sustainable and significant P&L outcomes. And we have a lot of confidence in each of our 3 growth engines. In Asset Management, we have multiple paths to surpass $1 trillion of AUM over the next 5 years. In insurance, we have strong conviction that we could double Global Atlantic from here. And finally, strategic holdings, which is really an unconstrained market opportunity for us and where we have a real right to win. We expect to have $1 billion-plus of annual operating earnings by 2030.
 Our business model is built to drive compounding earnings over a very long period of time. And while the opportunity in front of us is a massive one, we do believe that we can achieve our outline targets without having to build anything new. And we have a team and culture, as you would have heard from over 15 of our business leaders on April 10, that both facilitates and accelerates our ability to achieve our strategic ambitions. So when you combine our business model, together with our team and our culture, this is what distinctly differentiates KKR.
 And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. 
Craig Siegenthaler: Our question is on investing after Rob's healthy deployment commentary. But we wanted to focus specifically on private equity as I think there's a lot more visibility in direct lending and ABF, where you're seeing strength. But in private equity, we are watching some build in your deployment pipelines. I think Cotiviti is probably the biggest upcoming transaction. And now the CLO markets and syndicated loan markets are back online, but the recent rise in the 10-year probably wasn't that helpful. So can you provide us some comments on the expected investment activity levels in just your private equity business over the coming quarters? 
Craig Larson: Craig, it's Craig. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start? I'm sure Scott will have a couple of thoughts also. First -- and thanks for beginning in the way that you did. I think as Rob noted in our prepared remarks, the $1.1 billion of deployment you saw this quarter is not representative as we look at our activity. We've got a really healthy backlog of announced transactions. And if anything, it was just a dynamic, where a pretty modest amount of that activity closed in the 90 days ended March 31.
 I think in terms of where we've been deploying capital, we could start probably with some of the themes we talked about at Investor Day. So we talked about Asia as a region that we expect to drive meaningful opportunity for KKR for years to come. We talked about Japan, specifically. I think it's interesting when you look at Private Equity in our Real Assets business, the largest deployment we had this quarter was out of Japan. In that instance, it was out of our Japanese REIT business as they closed on the acquisition of 30-some-odd logistics warehouses that, again, we had touched on.
 I think as you also look at some of the activity we have in corporate carve-outs and private equity, we love those opportunities, where our operational resources and focus can really move the needle. So 2 of our larger pending investments, our corporate carve-out transactions, that's one in Europe as well as one in the U.S. Those are, again, both traditional private equity.
 And then I think the other point just to highlight in terms of broad deployment, we talked about it at Investor Day again, is infrastructure. And that's just an area where we bring deep expertise in the global footprint. Our second largest investment in the quarter was to take private of a U.K.-listed smart metering business. I'm sure some of you will remember that being a theme that we've invested behind and have had success historically.
 And again, as we look at our pipeline of announced but not yet closed activity, infra continues to be particularly active with themes and digital, renewables, et cetera. And again, activity here is global, well beyond the U.S. I think those -- some of the pending investments we have include companies based in Italy, Germany, Portugal, et cetera. So again, I think main takeaway is a very healthy pipeline, and we're continuing to find opportunities to deploy capital. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Craig, is we do think the M&A market is coming back. I think to your point, the leverage credit markets opened up in January. We are starting to see this impact all of our businesses, to Craig's comments. But I'd say, in particular, private equity pipeline, which is up significantly. There's a lot of activity. What we announced in Q1 is obviously backward looking given it takes some time for these deals to close. The Cotiviti deal that you mentioned actually closes today.
 So I think you're going to see more of the announced deals get closed, and you're going to see more deals get announced as this pipeline turns into real deal pipeline and that turns into real deployment. I think you're also going to see this on the monetization side. If the M&A market is picking up and the IPO markets are open, you're going to see us selling more assets as well, refinancing more assets and taking more companies public. So I think you're going to see more activity overall across private equity. 
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. 
Alexander Blostein: I wanted to go back to some of the targets you laid out at the Investor Day and really speaking to the $25 billion of cash flow you expect to generate over the next 5 years. Rob, I know you mentioned several buckets which are not that different. They're fairly consistent with kind of how you allocated capital historically. But I was wondering if you could comment on the mix specifically and sort of your priorities within those 4 buckets that you mentioned earlier. And I guess as part of that, when you think about growth in Strategic Holdings and incremental capital that you'll deploy there, how much of that is likely to be driven to sort of allocation to existing portfolio companies versus new investments? 
Robert Lewin: Great. And thanks a lot for the question, Alex. So you did mention this, I think the most important thing as it relates to capital allocation is to have a consistent framework, and we've had a really consistent framework for some time with one overriding objective, and that's to use our excess free cash flow to drive durable and recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share and to do so by leveraging our platform at really high ROEs. And I think the only thing that's really changed is, at our Investor Day, we outlined the opportunity to generate $25-plus billion of cash generation over the course of the next 5 years, and it's just a huge opportunity for us.
 In terms of bucketing across the 4 main areas of deployment, core private equity, share buybacks, insurance and strategic M&A, we don't have a fixed percentage by design. And it's really about being able to allocate that capital base nimbly to the opportunities that drive the highest return and the highest amount of earnings per share over a long period of time. That's our focus that's what we think we're really good at.
 As it relates to your question on Strategic Holdings, we outlined a path to $1 billion plus of Strategic Holdings operating earnings by 2030. It's something that we're confident in. We've got real visibility on where that's going to come from. I do think there's the opportunity if we see investments for us to be able to make in Strategic Holdings to drive that number north of that over time as we allocate capital. But again, no fixed percentage in how we're thinking about it. And I think that's a good thing, frankly, because I think it allows us to go after the highest returning and most ROE-friendly and earnings per share friendly opportunities that exist. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. 
William Katz: Obviously, a noticeable step-up in your gross sales, generally speaking. And if you just run rate this number, you're already north of your $300 billion number. So not that a few weeks change in the argument. But I was just sort of wondering if you could speak to the sequential change, particularly in the credit portfolio, where you're seeing really good momentum and maybe tie in the insurance opportunity with that. And I'll leave it there. 
Craig Larson: Bill, it's Craig, why don't I start. So I think there are a couple of things here. First probably worth highlighting investor interest in private credit as that continues to feel very good. So I think in direct lending, spreads have come in certainly. But if you look at a new direct lending deal, given where base rates are in 3 months so far, that's still a 10%-plus piece of paper. And in ABF, there's just a number of really positive macro tailwinds, as Chris Sheldon, again, walked through a handful of weeks ago. And within that part, we're active in both ABF -- in investment-grade ABF in addition to opportunistic.
 And so private credit for KKR at March 31 was $93 billion of AUM. These are big businesses for us. A year ago, we were at [ $76 billion ]. So we've seen a 22% increase year-over-year. So I think that's the first part. And then the second part, which ties into your question, is fundraising in our activities. Because you're right, we are seeing growth and fundraising in a number of different ways for us. And it's broad, which is great to see. It's institutional. It's private wealth. It's insurance. It's across multiple forms of capital, traditional funds, SMAs, evergreen vehicles, other perpetual forms of capital. And it's in the U.S. and it's outside the U.S.
 And I think that breadth of activity is really what you're seeing in our activity this quarter. Direct lending, we raised evergreen capital both in the U.S. and Europe. Opportunistic asset-based finance, capital raised. Asia private credit, we raised capital. Again, this is another area where we're constructive on the opportunity and how we're positioned given the strength of our Asia franchise. And in our K Series suite of products, we just launched our private BDC strategy. So I think you could think of that almost as upside from where we are here. So it does feel like we have a healthy amount of momentum, and it's broad-based across the firm. 
Scott Nuttall: Bill, it's Scott. The only thing I'd add is in addition to the organic fundraising that Craig ran through from third parties, we mentioned in the Investor Day the symbiotic relationship between Global Atlantic and our credit business in particular. We're definitely seeing that show up in the numbers as well. And it's also allowing us to see how our third-party insurance AUM as well at the same time. So it really does feed credit, and it has historically.
 What I think you're going to see over time though, and as Craig mentioned this, is that we are going to see GA also starting to do more across asset classes like real estate and infrastructure, especially on the core side. And as we mentioned last November when we announced that we're going to 100% ownership of Global Atlantic, that's one of the opportunities that we saw, we're just getting after that now. So I think you'll see it not only show up in credit, but in some of the real asset lines as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. 
Brian Mckenna: So just a 2-parter here on core private equity. So first, is the $20 million in net dividends in the first quarter a good quarterly baseline for the remainder of this year? Or should we expect some growth off of that? And then bigger picture, I'm curious if interest is picking up at all from LPs around the strategy, specifically as the portfolio continues to mature here while dividends are also set to increase notably in the coming years. 
Robert Lewin: Brian, it's Rob. I'll start off. Plus or minus $20 million Strategic Holdings operating earnings, a pretty good level to model for the remainder of the year. As we move forward and get closer to $300-plus million by 2026, I think you'll see a little bit more stability in that line item quarter-to-quarter. Might bump around a little bit in 2024, but plus or minus $20 million is about right.
 And as it relates to our core private equity strategy, listen, we are the largest core private equity manager today globally by a good margin. We think we've built because of our investment teams, our geographic reach, our industry gap, our collaborative culture. We've really built a best-in-class franchise, and it's something that I think we certainly be excited about continuing to partner with our clients on over time. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes. I think to the second question, Brian, we haven't been out actively marketing core private equity. We've got plenty of dry powder in the pools that we manage today. The next thing we'll be talking about with our investors on the PE side is going to be America's private equity. So we'll give you an update as those conversations come in. 
Operator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. 
Glenn Schorr: So you have a lot of growth in a lot of places. You mentioned no need to build anything new, but I'll ask the question anyway. Secondaries is just about the only area where you're not either scaled or well on the way to being scaled. I'm just curious if there is a plan, how important is it to LPs and for you? Or is that just a nice to have over time area? 
Robert Lewin: Glenn, it's Rob. I'll start. I think you hit on it in your last remarks there. It is not a need-to-have for us. And so we want to be in businesses where there are large addressable markets, and we've got conviction, we can be a top 3 player. Of course, over time, we've looked at the secondary space. You could assume that most every M&A transaction that's happened in the secondary space, has come across our desk here. And either we determined it wasn't the right partner to be a top 3 player or we determined that we just weren't willing to pay the price that was a prevailing price in the market.
 And so we're perfectly comfortable focusing on the aspects of our business that we're already in today. With that focus, we think we can be uniquely great at the things that we've already started and that provides more than enough running room for growth going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. 
Patrick Davitt: Could you give a little bit more specificity or color on the gross and net flows at GA in 1Q, and within the growth side, the mix of channels? And then more broadly, it looks like all of the bigger PRT or pension risk transfer deals this year have gone to more traditional insurance players. So I want to get your thoughts on to what extent the lawsuits and regulatory focus on that issue are cycling the opportunity for the more alts-backed insurers. 
Robert Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Patrick. So I'd say that if you look at the flows at GA this quarter, probably about 75% from the institutional side of our business, give or take. Again, that's inclusive of the big block transaction that we did in the quarter with Manulife. We've had really good momentum on the individual side of our business as well, with very strong sales both in Q4 of '23 and again in Q1 of 2024.
 And then on the PRT side, pension risk transfer side, we've talked about this as being a medium to long-term opportunity at GA. We really, coming into this year, did not have very much exposure here at all, but we have a team assembled against the opportunity, and we continue to believe that it's a really big opportunity given the capability of our Institutional Reinsurance platform for us to be able to take some share again starting off of a very low base. 
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. 
Daniel Fannon: I guess just a follow-up on the GA business. It seems like the cash in the block transactions kind of reduced returns a little bit in the quarter. Could you talk about the current operating environment for those returns based upon the business you're seeing today? 
Robert Lewin: Sure, Dan, it's Rob. I'll start. So what we're seeing in the GA business is really strong performance, really strong operating performance, and really an even stronger outlook for the future. What happened in Q1 or what transpired from a P&L perspective in Q1, very much by design. When you complete 2 very large block deals north of $20 billion of assets, you're going to take on the cost of those liabilities day one. But we really have a 12- to 18-month period where we've modeled redeployment of the assets into higher-yielding investments. And we're operating at higher levels of cash balance. That was point one. 
 Point two is a really interesting one, Scott started to touch on it a little bit earlier. We're seeing a really interesting opportunity in core and core plus real estate right now. There is just almost no core and core plus real estate capital out there. And we're able to create really attractive unlevered returns by leaning into that asset class. But one of the downsides of leaning into that asset class is a near-term downside in that the running yields on those investments tend to be in the 4%, 4.5% range. But we think those investments will certainly more than pay off in terms of the longer-term ROEs that they could generate.
 So much like how you'd hear us talking about investing in the near term for benefits of long term across everything we do, that would be a really good example where you could see some dilution to ROEs in the near term, but we think that are more than going to benefit Global Atlantic, its policyholders, ultimately our shareholders, in the long term given the attractive risk-adjusted returns we're seeing there. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Dan, is that none of this is a surprise. I mean we closed on $23 billion worth of block transactions. And when we price these deals, we assume there's going to be a ramp period. So that's proceeding as we expected. And I think the business overall is performing incredibly well. Both on the institutional side and the individual parts of GA, we're seeing a significant amount of growth and a significant amount of opportunity.
 And I think to the crux of your question, so far, the dollars that are getting deployed in the investment portfolio were hitting our target return levels. So it's just a rotation and it will take a little bit of time to get this money to work, but we feel very good about the progress of the trajectory. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. 
Benjamin Budish: Just following up on the topic of GA and some maybe modeling tidbits. So helpful commentary in terms of the time it takes to redeploy some of those assets. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pace of growth and the cost of insurance. It looks like quarter-over-quarter, it goes up as kind of the book turns over a little bit. But I guess, how should we think about that just as we forecast longer term?
 And then similarly, from a high-level perspective, I think in the past, you've kind of talked about guiding us to think about book value growth and your target mid-teens ROE. Just trying to think about how we should be thinking about that given you're now talking about the opportunity to accelerate longer-term growth? I know it hasn't been that long since you've owned 100% of GA, but just wondering if that's still the right framework or any other considerations. And then that other piece on the cost of insurance side. 
Robert Lewin: Yes. Great. So starting on the cost of insurance, and I think you really hit on it. As you see the rotation in a higher interest rate environment, our crediting spreads have, of course, gone up so have the yields that we're able to generate on the investment side of the portfolio. So being able to generate that spread continues to really exist in the business. So you'll continue to see, I think, an upward draft on our crediting spreads for a little bit. And then ultimately, it would be a function of where interest rates shake out. 
 In terms of our longer-term ROE numbers, I think the continued right range to be able to forecast Global Atlantic is really in that long term 14% to 15% pretax ROE range. Nothing has changed there. We feel really good about the liabilities that we're able to source in the marketplace. We've talked about our management team really feeling like they are best-in-class at being able to source simple, easy to understand, transparent liabilities at scale. I'll take our investment platforms up against anybody globally and being able to put those liabilities to work. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Chubak: So wanted to ask on the credit deployment and maybe just zooming in on the ABF opportunity. The U.S. banks have started to indicate greater appetite or willingness to pursue synthetic risk transfers just in an effort to alleviate some of their capital pressures. It's an area where, historically, they've been much less active than the European banks. And I was hoping you could just speak to the engagement levels with some of your U.S. bank partners, how you see the ABF deployment opportunity unfolding specifically within the SRT market and maybe just more broadly across the ABF landscape. 
Craig Larson: Why don't I start first. I think as it relates to SRTs, it is a market we are active in. It fits in our view, very well with our ABS strategy. We're knowledgeable across a host of assets, and we do like to partner with the banks. As you note, I think that activity has mainly been EU-focused. It does feel like we are starting to see more activity in the U.S. It also seems like the potential opportunity set could be expanding. I do think the most common underlying assets for SRTs have been in corporate loans, fund finance facilities, consumer term loans, does feel like banks are beginning to explore opportunities across other asset classes.
 And then I think the other point that you touched on, which is very important, is just this big macro tailwind we're seeing in that opportunity that it affords us and our team. Again, you look at the growth in our ABF platform as a whole, we're over $50 billion of AUM at this point in time. That's both opportunistic together with more investment-grade focused ABS strategies. And in terms of total deployment in a quarter like this one, we've overall as a firm have deployed a little over, round numbers, $3.5 billion of ABF activity in Q1, which is a pretty elevated pace for us. So activity does continue to feel like it's at a healthy level. 
Scott Nuttall: Part of the reason, Steven, that we spent so much time on this part of the business at the Investor Day is we do think this is a really interesting and sizable opportunity. Direct lending is really interesting as well in private credit, but asset-based finance is a much larger market, probably a $5 trillion market on its way to $7 trillion to $8 trillion. And it encompasses a significant number of asset classes, and you really need to have scale to be able to do it well.
 And so we talked about our 19 or 20 platforms better part of 7,000 people working at those platforms. I think you're going to see that businesses continue to scale in an attractive pace. And pleasingly, we're also seeing institutional investors understand this part of credit much more than they did a few years ago. So we are seeing this trend spread from Europe to the U.S. on the risk transfer side. I think that just speaks to the fact that deployment opportunity will continue to be robust. And banks are trying to free up capital, whether it's for M&A or to redeploy into other areas that they find interesting. So we've got plenty of opportunity here. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. 
Brian Bedell: So maybe switching gears to the capital markets business. I think you performed a little bit better than you had indicated at the conference, Rob, I think back in March for 1Q. Maybe if you could just talk about, I guess, the near-term trajectory in 2Q and what you're seeing so far. And more broadly, longer term, given the improvement in leverage credit markets and M&A activity and of course, the structural growth in your credit business, including in the asset-based finance area, maybe just your confidence on getting back to, say, an $800 million plus run rate level and even a time line to get to, call it, $1 billion plus annual level provided markets are conducive for that. 
Robert Lewin: Yes. Brian, a few thoughts. When you look back at 2022 and 2023, really tough operating conditions for our Capital Markets business. And for much of that time, Capital Markets on the equity side, on the leverage finance side, were largely shut. And our business generated ballpark $600 million of revenue in each of those 2 years. And so we're really proud of the durability of the franchise that we created. As I look at our pipelines today for the remainder of 2024, we get updated pipelines weekly, our pipelines are a lot better today than they were at this time last year. Now there's a lot to go execute on between now and the end of the year. But the forward indicators for our capital markets business sitting here in early May are definitely better than they were in May of 2023.
 And then more to your question around the longer term. If you look back in 2021, our Capital Markets business generated, a ballpark, $850 million of revenue. And clearly, you had buoyant capital markets that helped in 2021. But if you look at KKR today as a firm, we do more today than we did in 2021. I believe we have greater market share with our third-party clients than we did in 2021. And we've talked about the real opportunity to scale what we're doing in coordination with Global Atlantic. So when you combine all that, we continue to be really optimistic about what we're going to be able to create over the next several years with our Capital Markets franchise that is truly a unique business relative to any of our competitors out there right now. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes. So Brian, we've been in this business since 2006. And over that period of time, what you see is that the revenue tends to be quite correlated with deployment and monetization, especially in private equity and infrastructure. So if you go back to the prior discussion around the fact that our pipelines have picked up significantly, especially in those areas, and we're seeing more activity on the monetization side as well as the markets open up and strategic buyers come back. I think that bodes well.
 We had $800 million plus of revenues at KCM at a period of time where we had less dry powder, we had less overall AUM, we had less firm activity. So as the markets open back up, our expectation is we'll do better than that, but it's going to be somewhat dependent on deployment and monetizations across the firm. But it looks pretty good as we sit here today. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. 
Michael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask on ABF. You guys have had a lot of success. Heard the $50 billion ABF AUM figure, 19 platforms, $20 billion originations, I think last year. Just hoping you could talk a little bit more around the steps and actions you guys were taking to drive the originations meaningfully higher. How much of that do you think would be coming from more resources that are adding to the existing platforms versus or do you see a bigger needle mover from adding more platforms over time? And maybe you could talk about your vision around how you see this evolving over the next 5 years? 
Craig Larson: So why don't I start, Mike. I think you hit on a lot of the key points. I think that the asset-based finance business for us as a whole has just changed really dramatically post the Global Atlantic acquisition. And this is a business where scale begets scale. And so I think we've seen real advantages of partnering with GA, partnering with additional third-party clients. And then an important part of that have been all the platforms that Scott had mentioned and that Chris Sheldon had run through over the course of our Investor Day.
 And I think specifically, when you look at those 18, 19 platforms, they're global. As Scott mentioned, 7,000 people -- some-odd people, helping us source and originate unique deal flow for the benefit of our clients as we look forward from here. Will we look to grow that universe of platforms? I'm sure the answer to that is yes. Is that a number that's going to be 2x what it is today 2 years from now? I wouldn't want you to think anything along those lines. But I think there's continued opportunity for us to continue to build and drive scale.
 And one of the other important points, again, as Scott mentioned a few minutes ago, it does feel like client knowledge of this opportunity is one that's been increasing dramatically. It felt to us like infrastructure and direct lending in these other asset classes, there was a period of time where it took some real education on the part of our clients, and that education can come in baby steps. And ABF is a unique asset class because it's been around for a long, long time, but it's really not been a distinct asset class as many of our clients have thought about their portfolios. So at the same point in time that our strategic position is one that's increased dramatically and improved dramatically, it just feels like that knowledge level with our clients is coming up the curve at the same time. And I think that's what you're seeing in our results. 
Scott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. I think we're going to -- we'll add more platforms, probably not as many as we have. We will add resources to the existing platforms. But remember, these businesses are already out in the market sourcing investment opportunity. And so to some extent, the way I think about it is we're capital constrained, not opportunity constrained. So to the extent we continue to scale our capital base here, we can do more with the existing origination platforms we've already set up. And it's less about needing to add a lot of resources as opposed to just taking more advantage of the flow we're already seeing.
 And as Craig said, now that private credit has become a better understood part of what we do, as private credit allocations get created, more work is getting done on this part of the space. And so we're seeing allocations to direct lending and ABF as part of that continue to pick up. And we've seen this across other asset classes, there's pattern recognition. As those allocations get created and people look to get to the number that they picked, what we tend to see on the back of that is quite a bit of capital formation. So we feel like we're ready for that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. 
Patrick Davitt: Could you give us the updated visible announced but not closed realization revenue number? And then more broadly, I guess we've got some conflicting messages out there about how good the realization environment really is, overall sense that you're still pretty constructive. So maybe just update us on what your -- what's driving your confidence and maybe what you think is -- why your tone is diverging from what we've heard from some other players out there. 
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks for the follow-up, Patrick. So today, we've got north of $400 million of visible pipeline as it relates to monetization, call that roughly 60% carry, 40% investment income. As you noted, our pipelines are pretty healthy. As we look at that $400 million, I should be clear, it's not certain all if that's going to close in Q2. Some of that's got some regulatory approvals as part of that. But as we look at our pipelines, they are better on the monetization side that they've been at any point over the past 12 to 18 months.
 I can't really comment on what others are saying. I could just comment on what we're feeling across the firm. And I'm not sure to be all that much of a surprise. We're seeing the leverage finance market come back. You're starting to see CLO formation sit behind the leveraged finance market. And that all creates additional dry powder in the system for deal activity, which is the fuel to greater monetization. And so we'll see. There's a lot to get done in order to monetize the pipeline. But at least for KKR, we're feeling relatively constructive versus where we had been maybe 12 months ago at this time. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Patrick, I'd say we -- I don't know why you're hearing a bit of a different tone. Maybe the markets themselves have a little bit of fragility. The geopolitical risk, there's a good amount of angst about the macro, that could be part of it. Our comments are based on kind of the environment continuing like we see it right now. But if something happened, exogenous shocks, then sure, it could change the environment. But it could be that our portfolio is maybe more global than some, maybe a bit more mature across aspects of what we invested in some. But we're seeing it. This isn't a speculation, we can see it and feel it in terms of the live discussions we're having. 
Craig Larson: And only part, Patrick, I'd add on to both of those comments really would relate to that investment performance aspect of this, you look at our gross unrealized carry, that number is up 50% year-over-year. That's a pretty big increase, recognizing both the value creation we've seen, together with the fact that we've been in a more modest realization environment. And I think when you look at some of the underlying statistics, as Scott said, we've got a healthy amount of the portfolio that's pretty seasoned. So roughly 50% of that would be 4 years or greater as we look at the maturity of the private equity portfolio.
 But then you've got to layer in investment performance alongside of that. So almost 30% of that is marked at 2x or greater. And somewhere between 55% and 60% is marked at 1.5x cost and greater. So I think you have this combination of maturing portfolio together with strong investment performance that, as we look forward, gives us confidence and, again, ultimately seeing that flow through to our financials. 
Operator: We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing comments. 
Craig Larson: I would just like to really thank everybody for the time that you've invested in KKR. When we think of the announcements we made in November and at the Investor Day just a few weeks ago, and then together with our Q4 and Q1 earnings, we've been very active in taking a lot of mind share from everyone. So thanks for your investment in understanding KKR better. And please follow up with us directly with any follow-on questions. Thanks so much. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Craig Larson, Partner, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. And as a reminder, our earnings release in our financial reporting for Q4 is consistent with past quarters beginning in Q1 of 2024, our earnings release will reflect the segment and financial metric changes we announced on November the 29th. Turning now to our numbers for the quarter, we're pleased to be reporting strong fourth quarter results with fee-related earnings per share of $0.76. This is a record figure for KKR up 21% from Q3 2023 as well as Q4 of 2022. After tax distributable earnings came in at $1 per share. New capital raised in the quarter was $31 billion, which is also particularly strong. So overall, a really solid quarter for us. I'll begin this morning by walking through our financials in a little more detail. So management fees in the quarter are 785 million. That's up 3.4% compared to just last quarter, with growth across all of our business lines. And comparing full year '23 to 2022, management fees grew 14%. We reported double-digit percentage annual growth in our management fees for several consecutive years now. Net transaction and monitoring fees were 264 million in the quarter. Capital markets transaction fees in particular were quite strong in Q4 with 225 million in revenue that was driven by an increase in investment activity and financing transactions at several of our PE and core PE portfolio companies. So in total, fee-related revenues for the quarter were 1.1 billion, up 17% on a year-over-year basis compared to Q4 of 2022. Turning to expenses. Fee-related compensation, as usual was at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5 a fee-related revenues for the quarter as well as for the year. Other operating expenses were 156 million. So in total, fee-related earnings were 675 million or $0.76 per share. As I mentioned just a moment ago, this was a record FRE quarter for us. And this growth really highlights in our view the continued strength as well as the diversification that you're seeing across the firm. Our FRE margin in the quarter came in at 63% and on a per share basis FRE was $2.68 for the year. Turning now to realization activity. For the quarter, we generated 411 million a realized performance income. This was driven by multiple successful sales across our traditional private equity and core businesses, with realized incentive fees driven by Marshall Wace in the fourth quarter. Realized investment income in the quarter was 147 million. So together monetizations were 558 million. In total asset management operating earnings were 970 million. Moving to our insurance segment, performance continued to be strong in the quarter with 231 million of pre tax earnings that's up 10% quarter-over-quarter. This was the result of stronger net inflows across both the institutional and individual channels, as well as variable investment income from the sale of a solar developer that generated 16 million of insurance segment pre tax operating earnings. So in total, after tax PE was 888 million or $1 per share. In comparison with the prior quarter, that figure was up 14%. Next, turning to investment performance, you can see this on page seven of the earnings release. The private equity portfolio appreciated 3% in the quarter and 16% in the year. In real assets, the opportunistic real estate portfolio was down one in the quarter and down two for the year. Infrastructure was up 5% in the quarter and up 18% for the year. So very strong broad performance across our infrastructure platforms. And in credit, the leverage credit composite was up three and the alternative credit composite was up 2%. And over the year performance year was up 14% and 10% respectively. And finally, consistent with our historical practice, we are intending to increase our annual dividend from $0.66 to $0.70 per share, which we anticipate will go into effect alongside first quarter 2024 earnings. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. First looking at our key operating metrics. New capital raised totaled 31 billion for the quarter. These results are quite strong and encouraging for us as we head into 2024. Credit and liquid strategies made up about two thirds of the capital we raised this quarter. As our business has grown with Global Atlantic as a significant partner. GA in particular had record inflows in the quarter, both overall and specifically from the individual channel. So activity here continues to be very strong. Block activity at GA is also active. As you know the MetLife block closed in the quarter and the Manulife block transactions is expected to close sometime in the first half of 2024. And similar to prior blocks, GA continues to be very capital efficient here, contributing approximately 25% of the equity in both transactions with 75% of the capital coming from IV vehicles and additional CO investors. So 75% from third parties where we can earn management fees and have the opportunity for performance income as well. Over the past year, new capital raised totaled right around 70 billion. And looking post 12/31, we just announced the final closing in Asia Infrastructure 2 at approximately 6.4 billion over 65% larger than the previous fund. Of note, more than half of the capital came from new investors to the Asia Infrastructure platform. With this successful fundraise, we are clearly the largest infrastructure fund in the region, enhancing our Asia positioning more broadly. And as we look out over the next 12 months and into 2025, a number of our flagship funds will be raising capital as well. So we continue to expect an acceleration our fundraising from here. Turning to capital invested, we deployed 16 billion in the quarter and 44 billion for the year. Capital invested was really diversified across private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies in the year, as U.S. private equity and core private equity deployment rebounded in the quarter. Of particular note, we made investments in three big private transactions in Q4. And with almost 100 billion of uncalled capital, we continue to be well positioned for the deployment opportunities that are ahead. I wanted to briefly shift now to a reflection on our progress through the course of 2023. Our assets under management now total 553 billion that's up 10% compared to the end of 2022. With sizable capital raised in the past year, fee paying AUM now stands at almost 450 billion. Given our consistent growth in fee paying AUM, management fees increased 14% in 2023, with line of sight of future growth from approximately 40 billion of committed capital that becomes fee paying asset invested or when it enters its investment period. And that's at a weighted average rate of just over 90 basis points. And while realized performance and investment income was more muted in 2023, given the environment, our forward visibility has increased meaningfully year-over-year. Total embedded gains were 12.3 billion at year end that reflects embedded gains on our balance sheet plus gross unrealized carried interest. This was up almost 40% compared to Q4 of 2022. The opportunity for future investing revenue remains robust. And strategically, we made a lot of progress in 2023. As you likely know, we announced 40 initiatives towards the end of November. As an update, on January 2, we closed on our acquisition of the remaining stake in Global Atlantic for approximately 2.6 billion in cash. We believe this acquisition will create more value for policyholders and shareholders and are excited to unlock future potential together. Concurrent with the closing of GA, we have created a new strategic holding segment, which you will see in our Q1 2024 earnings release. Here the segment operating earnings will be driven by cash dividends from our core PE portfolio. We also revised their compensation ratios, which similarly will be reflected in our Q1 financials, delivering more FRE to our shareholders, and driving even more alignment between our compensation model and the outcomes of our clients. Combining these aspects, we will be introducing a new reporting framework that will better highlight our business model. This will include a new financial metric, total operating earnings, which represents our more recurring forms of income. Prior to our next earnings call, we will provide recap financials to help you further understand the various key metrics. As a reminder, we do expect these announcements to be accretive to all of our per share metrics. And together with the competence and current visibility we have, it is what allowed us to increase our 2026 FRE per share target to $4.50 plus cents per share. In 2023, we generate $2.68 per share of FRE. So our expectation is for a lot of growth from here. Given these four announcements paired with the existing growth engines we have, we believe that we are well set up to drive meaningful scale. The opportunities we have across asset management, insurance and strategic holdings are multi-fold. Turning first to our asset management business. There remains a lot of upside here with multiple drivers of growth. We have a lot of younger strategies that are just beginning to scale. We started 25 or so investing businesses through the past decade alone, and many are now starting to inflect. We are an asset classes and geographies with massive end markets, Asia, infrastructure, including climate and credit are all great examples. And as a reminder, we only want to be competing in areas with large addressable markets and where we have conviction that we can be a top three player. We are in the early days of tapping into the private wealth end market. We've had early success in our case theory suite of products with the tremendous amount of opportunity that is still in front of us. With these growth avenues, along with our strong track record count, and the trust that we've built with our clients, we feel that we could double our asset management business from here. And that's without starting anything new. Second, we have a meaningful opportunity in insurance with our partnership with Global Atlantic. Insurance is a very powerful contributor to our business. GA has already created a lot of value, going from 72 billion of assets under management at our announcement of the initial transaction in July of 2020 to over 170 billion of assets under management today, including the pending Manulife block deal. We have a strong opportunity to unlock even more value together in investing, product development, global expansion, private wealth distribution and capital markets. And we are still in the very early stages of our partnership. And finally, number three, strategic holdings, where our opportunity is highly differentiated. This segment leverages all of our people, capabilities and our collaborative culture. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe is a huge addressable market. And that's in addition to the current visibility we already have to drive net dividends in this segment of $300-plus million by 2026 and $600-plus million by 2028. In summary, we are incredibly well positioned as a firm. And we really don't think there are many companies in our industry or others that have the type of visibility that we have for long-term growth. We have a high level of confidence that we can meaningfully grow all 3 of our business segments; asset management, insurance and strategic holdings. With that, we are excited to announce we are going to host an Investor Day in New York on April 10. Given the November strategic announcements and all of the opportunities across our firm, we thought it would be timely for you to hear directly from our senior leaders. We will provide additional detail in the coming months, and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss our outlook and these opportunities. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: We were looking for an update on funding raising for your 3 largest flagships. So we have global in for 5, with 4 that's already 60% invested. It's higher when you look at the committed. In Asia, 5 and North America 14, which are both over 40% now. So how should we think about the timing of these fundraises given the commitment levels and AUM targets given the size of prior funds, they're all large funds. And more importantly, how should we think about the FRE ramp from these new funds less step-downs from the last exit?
Craig Larson: Good morning, Craig, it's Craig, why don't I start on that. First, look, one of the things that runs mind as it relates to the trajectory of new capital raised, and you would have heard this in the prepared remarks from Rob, relates to the topic exactly as it relates to our flagship strategies. So when you look at the largest fund complexes within our firm, so Americas, Europe, Asia PE, Core PE infrastructure, less than $1 billion of the capital that we raised last year, we raised $70 billion in total, less than $1 billion of that came from those strategies. And if you look over '22 and '23, we raised round numbers, $150 billion of new capital and around $6 billion came from those flagships. And so as we think about '24 and '25, we think that that's going to look different. And so we are actively fundraising for our infrastructure strategy and do expect to launch fundraising for our Americas private equity strategy later in the year, with Asia likely a 2025 initiative for us. On the deployment numbers, you mentioned, those numbers are always a little understated. I remember, if we have platform investments, et cetera, that capital is going to be spoken for, or if there happens to be capital drawn under the line, that's going to be paid back inside of 180 days, again, that capital will be additive. So those deployment numbers always look a little more understated relative to how we think of that positioning. And then I think there's a couple of other points here. The next one would relate to scaling. We mentioned in our press release that we had the final closes on our Next-Gen Tech 3 and Impact strategies. We had nice scaling in those strategies compared to their prior vintages. Again, Rob talked about the good news as it relates to Asia infrastructure for us. We do expect scaling in our wealth strategies alongside of that. And then finally, we feel like we have a lot of momentum in Global Atlantic, both in the individual as well as the institutional channels. So I think the opportunities that we see for new capital raised and, in turn, management fee growth is really an attractive part of our positioning with the flagship certainly being an important part of that.
Rob Lewin: Good morning, Craig. It's Rob. I'll pick up as it relates to your question on FRE. When you look at some of these big flagships that will be in the market and their predecessor funds, they don't have big step-downs in fee rates as they transition to post-investment period. In addition to that, when you think about the runoff, a lot of the runoff from investment is probably going to come from 2 funds prior and 3 funds prior, those funds close out. But maybe kicking it up a level, if you think about where we are today and where we're going, and I hit this in the prepared remarks, we're at $2.68 of FRE per share. And we've guided 3 years from now, we have an expectation of being at $4.50-plus per share. And so in order to get there, our expectation is we're going to have a lot of management fee growth and the flagships, on a net basis, will be a part of that story.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Craig, is I think our overall view on fundraising is quite optimistic. I mean, Craig Larson mentioned it, but the $150 billion we raised for 4% of that have come from flagships is a pretty low number speaks to how we've been scaling the diversification of the firm. And as you know, a number of our strategies are kind of in this nice part of the inflection curve Funds II, III, IV, where we can see a significant amount of growth. So you're absolutely right to point out the flagships are coming back at what we think is going to be a really good time. But we also have 22 of our 30 strategies that are coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, we put in that younger category. Fund I, II, III, open-ended these newer strategies. And you can see it. Asia-Infra, up 66%, tech growth was up 30%. Our impact fund doubled even in the environment that we saw over the last couple of years. Yet, on top of that, private wealth, GA, Asia speaks to the optimism that we see kind of regardless of what's happening with the backdrop.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: I was hoping you could start with just building on your prior comments around expansion in the wealth channel. You mentioned you're seeing quite a bit of success early days, only a couple of quarters in some of these platforms. So maybe a little bit about what products you expect to be out in the market with over the course of this year, how many platforms you're on, et cetera. But also, I guess more importantly, I believe in the past your targets for 2026 and FRE MD really did not include a whole lot of conception from these initiatives. So maybe just kind of confirm that and what do you think those initiatives could ultimately contribute over time?
Craig Larson: Hey, Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I start, thanks for that. And just stepping back and level setting for everyone. So as of 12/31, around $75 billion of our assets under management are from individuals. And that number does not include policyholders of Global Atlantic. So you could argue that, that $75 billion, if anything is understated as it relates to the presence and the activities we have with individuals broadly. Now most of that $75 billion are from high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals as well as family offices that have invested in our funds and strategies. And in terms of our fundraising in total, a double-digit percentage of our new capital raised historically has typically gone from individuals. So it's been a healthy part of that fundraising activity. Now back to your question, most specifically, most recently, we've introduced what we call our K Series suite of products. And so these are funds and strategies that are really designed and tailored specifically for wealth investors. So K Infra and [KEF] [ph] are the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on infrastructure. K Prime and K Pec are the U.S. and non-U.S. vehicles focused on private equity. We launched both private equity and infrastructure only midway through 2023. And with those products in real estate and credit on top of that, as well as our private BDC soon to be launched of that $75 billion of wealth, around $6.5 billion of that is from these K Series suite of products. Now a year ago, that was $2.4 billion. So we're in the early days, but we feel really good about the progress from here. And as we look at some of the underlying statistics, that's particularly true as it relates to infrastructure and private equity, which are newer asset classes for more mass affluent investors. As we've mentioned historically, we're raising about $500 million a month as we look at the K Series suite. And so it feels like reception and interest in our momentum continues to feel really good. And to your point, we do expect to see an acceleration in the number of platforms in the first half of '24. So it's great progress. But I think to us, even the more interesting part is really that long-term secular dynamic because mass affluent individual investors historically have not had an easy way to access these types of products and strategies. And so over the coming years, if we're correct and you start to see allocations go from the low single digits to the mid-single digits, that literally is trillions of dollars that have the potential to move to alternative products. And when we think of how we're positioned given our brand, our track record, the investments that we've made in distribution and marketing, our ability to product-innovate, we feel really well positioned to be a winner in the space over the long term.
Rob Lewin: Alex, just as it relates to your question on our 2026 targets. Historically, we haven't included much of anything as it relates to private wealth. As we look forward, given some of the early success that Craig just went through, we do see some contribution coming over the next few years across the number of different investing businesses that we have. And Craig just hit on it at the end, the real opportunity we see as we do long-term financial modeling is really in that post-2026 area, between 2026, '28, as we continue to ramp, that's where you're going to start to see a real inflection and much more material contribution to our P&L.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: So the question relates to the banks, and I see 2-way activity. I see right now, I see a little bit more banks coming back into the leveraged loan space, and you see some movement and them getting into providing some services in private credit. Yet at the same time, we know capital requirements are going up in private credit world and more asset-backed opportunities are coming your way. So I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about that dynamic and what specifically you're doing on the asset-backed side to position for what we all think is a lot of growth ahead. Thanks.
Craig Larson: So Glenn, why don't I start. And thanks for asking, because these are really important secular drivers really as it relates to both businesses. So as a reminder as of year-end, we had around $90 billion of private credit AUM, almost 50 of that was in asset-based finance and $38 billion in direct lending. So these are big businesses for us. I think probably larger than someone might expect in the framework of KKR. And you touched on two things. I think first, as it relates to direct lending and overall activity, we are seeing a lot more activity in the leveraged loan, in the high-yield market and CLO issuance feels like it's picking up. We actually look at all of that as really good for our businesses. And as it relates, now a lot of that has been refinancing related, so it's been less new dollars in. But as it relates to new deals, we think that's going to be helpful for mid-market M&A. And if the private credit markets end up having a lower market share but of a bigger pie. We think that dynamic is one that can still work really well in the framework of our firm. And in terms of private credit, I think there are lots of advantages that are going to lead to people to continue to use that market. The point on ABF is a really, really important one, and it relates to the dynamics that you're talking about. So I think as banks pull back from many types of lending and divest noncore loan portfolios, our opportunity set, we think, is just going to continue to expand. And you've actually seen this in recent announcements from us. So two weeks ago, we announced an accounts receivable financing for our barbecue business. I remember you actually sent me an e-mail on this. As I know you were hoping that could lead to nice little trinkets at our next Investor Day. In December, we announced a partnership with BMO focused on a $7 billion portfolio of RV loans. In October, Goldman announced the sale of the GreenSky platform to a handful of buyers of which we were part of that consortium. And in August and September, we announced the acquisition of a portfolio of prime auto loans from a regional bank in the Southeast. So I think you're seeing lots of opportunities to firms like ours to participate in asset-based finance in a way that you didn't see 5 years ago, and it's a really important tailwind as we think about the growth and opportunities that we see ahead.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Glenn, is we see a lot written about the direct lending market, rightly so, it's become a very large and important market. I think Craig is right. M&A volumes have been down. Private credits had a larger share of a smaller amount of volume. And so as the banks come back, our expectation is you'll see M&A volume pick up, and there'll still be plenty for the private credit market to participate in. But this ABF business, I don't think is that well understood yet, whereas the direct lending market is probably roughly $1.5 trillion, the ABS market is probably closer to $5 trillion, on its way to $7 trillion. And it is kind of my view, becoming an asset class for institutional investors to understand a little bit. Like 10, 12 years ago, infrastructure and direct lending were very new concepts for most investors. We're having more dialogue on asset-based finance, seeing more investors start to create an allocation or a sub-allocation on private credit. It's obviously incredibly synergistic with what we're building at Global Atlantic, and we're seeing interest from third-party insurers as well. And I do think there's a significant amount of growth ahead for that business. We have 20 or so origination platforms around asset-based finance so far, and I'd expect that number to continue to go up. I would guess in April when we're together for the Investor Day, we'll go deeper on that topic.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Katz: So maybe just flipping over to the insurance platform and just sort of adjusting for the solar gain in the quarter. I mean how we should be thinking about the ROE for the platform given sort of, two parts, one, and now you have 100% of the platform. And two, if interest rates were to go lower, is there enough growth in the business to offset any kind of degradation in net spreads? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Hey, Bill, all great questions. Thank you. First thing, I guess we look at Q4 and we look at 2023, a very strong performance from the Global Atlantic business. Management team has done a great job, and it's a big reason why we're excited to own 100% of the business. You are right that in Q4, as well as through 2023, that the P&L did have some tailwinds, some variable investment income on a gross basis, about $35 million in Q4. At the beginning of the year, we're at about 20% of our book on a net basis exposed to floating rate. Team did a good job making that adjustment, and so got the benefit of rising rates through much of '23. We ended the year at about 16%. And so as we think about interest rates going down in 2024, we're conscious of that. In Q4, too, specifically, we made a modest adjustment to our comp. So effectively had over-accrued a little bit through the course of Q1, Q2 and Q3. So all things that positively impacted the quarter and all things front of mind as it relates to how we plan for 2024. So as we look at Q4, not necessarily replicable in the near term. But as you said, we have so many levers to be able to grow the GA franchise that our expectation even in a reducing rate environment is that GA is going to continue to perform. As it relates to ROE targets, we continue to think the right level to model the business at that 14% to 15% pretax ROE. The team has done a nice job being able to beat that and beat that by a healthy margin over the past couple of years. But we are going into an environment here that could be lower interest rates and put a little bit of pressure on the P&L.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Mckenna: So just a question on the capital markets business. I'm curious, how did activity trend throughout the fourth quarter? I'm assuming November and December were better months just as broader markets rallied quite a bit into year-end and then has this momentum carried into the new year? And I'm just trying to get a sense of the jumping off point for capital markets activity levels to start 2024.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're really pleased with the performance of our capital markets business in Q4 and really for all of 2023. If you look at Q4 specifically, great quarter did benefit maybe from a bit of deferrals, some fees that could have been that ended up in Q4. You're right, as the markets picked up in November and December, that definitely helped as well. But I think the more important point on our capital markets business, really, if you look at 2022 and 2023, through much of both of those years, debt capital markets, equity capital markets were largely shut. And our business still was able to generate, on average, close to $600 million of annual revenue in both of those years. So we're quite proud of the resilience of the business model, the durability of the business model. So it wasn't that long ago in a very healthy market environments, our capital markets business was generating roughly $400 million a year. And as you also point out, we've got a business that can generate really outsized outcomes when the markets come back. It wasn't that long ago, 2021, where our capital markets business in very healthy markets generated $840 million of revenue. Now despite the strong Q4, we're not back to those healthy levels of capital markets deployments. It's still relatively muted across the space. Leverage finance market feels better, but the CLO market is continuing to get healthy. IPO markets, secondary markets, they continue to trend in an upward way, but not back anywhere close to where we were in 2021. Now as we think about pipelines going into 2024, we're quite constructive. As it relates to Q1, still very early in the quarter to give you a read. But our pipeline as we're going into the year just across the firm from deployment, the engagement we're having with our third-party clients, we're expecting a constructive 2024.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Finian O'Shea: Going back to ABF, a lot of color you provided there. Recently in a presentation, you outlined the ABF origination growth in recent years, seeing if you can touch on the potential for improvement into 2024. And then what that can mean for the credit fee rate and potentially the capital markets opportunity. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Finian, it's Craig, why don't I start there. So we noted in that presentation that if you look 2018 to 2020, so before the GA acquisition, average annual asset origination was in that $9 billion a year. And if you look post acquisition, we've averaged $25 billion. Now that is not just ABF, that includes direct lending, that includes mortgage loans, et cetera. So I think as we look how we're positioned in growth in activity from here, we think the opportunity for that is one that's going to be able to expand as it relates from an ABF standpoint, both the insurance relationships that we have in addition to the capital that we have, that's more opportunistic in nature. So I think again, that outlook for us is one, as we've continued to grow and expand, that we're very positive on and could be a real growth engine within the credit business broadly.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Fin, is that you're right to ask about the KCM opportunity. As a reminder, when we spoke at the end of November, we talked about all the different positive opportunities we had to unlock more value with GA, including across the rest of the firm from an investing standpoint, creating new product, private wealth distribution, Ivy, which is our third-party fund strategy, and then global in particular, Asia. And as part of that list, we did talk about the capital markets opportunity and we do think that, that can be quite meaningful for us. So think of it as, in effect using the model we've already built with KCM, but more across this ABF platform. We really haven't gotten to that yet. And when we had 37% ownership from third parties, it was a little bit more challenged to get after that. We think over time, that could be a significant opportunity, call it, in the hundreds of millions of dollars if we can get that right. It's going to take time. We'll keep you posted on it, but we do think that is the next big legged growth across all things structured finance, structured credit, asset-based finance for KCM.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Davitt: Questions on margin. The FRE margin came in much better than consensus. So firstly, is that mostly a function of the much better capital markets results? And secondly, if so, if this continues into 2024, as you suggest, should we expect a similar incremental positive operating leverage impact as that line item recovers? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Hey, Patrick. For quite some time, and we've guided that we feel like we've got a business model that could operate in the low 60s from an FRE margin perspective, which drove the FRE margin beat in the quarter is a combination of a few things: healthy management, fee growth, clearly very strong capital markets quarter for us. And then also some operating expense leverage as well. As we move into 2024, with our already announced shift in how we're going to form our compensation pool at ATR and reducing the compensation load against our fee-related revenue, our expectation is, going forward, we're going to be sustainably able to operate in the mid-60% FRE margin zip code as a firm. And I think I said this last call or the call before, I don't think that mid-60% level is a cap for us given the business model that we're employing. We're trying to scale things that we've already started here. And if we're right and are able to execute on that, we're going to be able to drive revenue growth, fee revenue growth, at a level that's well in excess of expense growth over the next several years. So I do think we should be able to, absent a really draconian type of market environment, operate at that mid-60% FRE margin quarter in, quarter out, with the potential to be able to drive that up over time, assuming we're able to execute as a management team like we think we can.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Chubak: So two-parter for me just on the PE fundraising outlook. The closings for the next-gen tech fund, the third Global Impact Fund, certainly encouraging. Meaningful step-ups versus the prior vintages. Does that momentum increase or inform your confidence for the upcoming PE flagship fund raise? Or are these simply too niche and sector specific to offer any sort of read across? And when do you expect to go to market with the funds given the significant amount of deployment capacity that you still have to work through?
Craig Larson: Hey. It's Craig, why don't I start. Look, I think, again, as it relates to the deployment capacity, the numbers are going to be understated given platforms or platform investments we've made, et cetera. So I don't think the dynamic is, one, as it relates to deployment, I think in particular as we look at our pipelines which are building and actually expect across the industry to see deployment increase in '24 as it relates to '23. And I think as it relates to your first question in terms of overall tone, look, I think as a starting point. We've seen a nice increase in public markets. We've seen broad markets improve since mid-October, to say the least. High yield and fees are up, LSD's up. And I think in addition to that, we've all seen the increase in the capital markets. And so I think given that backdrop as it relates to fundraising and tone, I think like if anything, on balance, it feels like clients are more front-footed. And again, it's tough to draw broad conclusions from one-month of activity, and we'll see how things continue to play out from here. But given our track records, the performance that we've had, in particular, in a business for us, like Americas private equity over a long, long period of time, I think we feel very good about the opportunities that we see as we embark upon fundraising for that strategy.
Scott Nuttall: Steven, it's Scott. To your question about read across. I don't think it's a stretch to say that it does inform our broader perspective. Much of the funds that you mentioned were raised at a period of time where the capital markets were nearly as robust. And what we've seen is that investors are re-upping the funds where they've seen strong performance. Also, the color from the dialogue we're having is, I think, even more mature programs out there understand these are going to be very good vintage years and don't want to miss out. I think in the past, if you go back to the financial crisis, there are some institutions that pulled back and then had regret. And so I think there's an understanding of that in the market. And that's on the more mature programs, which I would say the minority of the people that we talk to. If you think about how the industry has expanded across sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, family offices, obviously, we talked about the private wealth channel, we're optimistic. Some part are based on those discussions and in large part based on the great work our team has been doing in terms of keeping the investment performance very strong.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Bedell: Maybe just to focus back on capital markets and maybe more of the longer-term view. So if you think about it from more of a structural basis in terms of your current dry powder, but also the deployment pipeline over the next few years from your flagship fundraising cycle, and then you mentioned the ABF opportunity as well over the long term. So as we think about that and building out to 2026, not to put a number on it, but is it fair to assume you could easily be well over $1 billion in capital markets fees by then even without a particularly robust capital markets environment? And in terms of your $4.50 per share cost target, should we be thinking of maybe a more robust environment as you're driving the plus in that equation as opposed to the baseline of $4.50?
Rob Lewin: Hi, Brian. It's Rob. I'll start off. So we really like our business model and our approach to market with our capital markets business and I think that's a big reason why there's a lot of upside. And the way we face the market really is with one team that represents our private credit pools of capital, where we're one of the largest providers in the world. Our capital markets expertise, it's that same team when they're facing a client, that can well across our liquid credit business, which is one of the biggest liquid credit businesses in the world. And so we combined 3 very large aspects of our business, and we think that's a real benefit to our clients. And there's not a lot of firms out there that can match what we do from a coordination perspective. I like our ability to go compete for talent in the capital market space. We've been able to recruit and retain, over the past number of years, some really talented people at what they do. And especially as we've expanded in product and geography that's a big part of our story and I can see more of that. You referenced what types of upside we have. I think if you look back to 2021, of course, we had a buoyant capital markets at the time. But KKR does a lot more as a firm today, both from a product perspective, deployment perspective and geographically than we did then. We think we're going to continue to be able to take share with third-party clients. And Scott just touched on the opportunity to coordinate with Global Atlantic and the opportunity that, that can create on the ABF side. And so no specific numbers -- excuse me, on the ABF side of KCM. Those specific numbers of course, as it relates to 2026, but we think this is a growth-oriented business and we think in a really good capital markets environment, we're going to be able to grow off of that $840 million revenue number that we put up in 2021.
Scott Nuttall: Brian, it's Scott. Look, I think we'll go deeper on this in April when we're together. But the way we think about it, if you look back 5 years, it's really not very representative of what KCM is today and where it's going to be, to your point. So we've been globalizing the business across more of what KKR is doing around the world. We've been penetrating more of our own strategies and efforts. So for example, if you go back several years, infrastructure wasn't a very big part of the Capital Markets business, now it's a very large part of that business. And that informs our perspective on the ABF opportunity, candidly, the real estate opportunity over time. And then on top of that, our portfolio is larger. So there's more refinancing. There's more exits to do in the public markets. And as our deployment goes up in our experience and our dry powder goes up, so do our capital markets opportunities. Because we can speak for larger transactions, we need to bring partners alongside, there's just more for us to do. So all of that speaks to the growth opportunity, which is why I think you're seeing this baseline, even in a pretty anemic capital market overall, continue to increase. And I think you'll continue to see that into the future as we execute on all of those.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Benjamin Budish: I just wanted to check, I think you didn't mention in the prepared remarks, but can you share any color on your line of sight towards realization and related revenues into Q1? It sounds like on the capital market side, things are looking pretty strong. But just wondering on the realization side, anything you can share to date.
Rob Lewin: We have a pretty healthy pipeline as we're coming into 2024 from a monetization factor. But what I'd say is timing is a little bit less certain given some regulatory approvals that are required around some of these monetizations. But taken together, we have somewhere around $500 million of very high visibility, monetization-related revenue. But we currently don't expect all that to hit in Q1. Obviously, still a couple of months to go in the quarter as well. And as usual, at the end of Q1. We'll provide our standard press release that gives you more detail around the monetization related revenue for the quarter. Maybe while we're on the topic of monetization, one other thing that I think is worth calling out given the growth across a number of our businesses and also the strategic announcements that we made in November, including moving our comp down on fees and up on carry, this is just a much smaller part of our business than it used to be at KKR. It's part of the reason why you'll see us introduce this new metric in Q1, total operating earnings. Our expectation going forward is north of 70% of our earnings is going to come from total operating earnings. So of course, monetization-related revenue is going to be a big part of where we're going as a firm, it's just a lot smaller on a relative basis than it used to be.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Brown: Great. I just wanted to ask on infrastructure. So strong performance there in the quarter. Can you maybe just expand on some of the key drivers behind that 5% performance in the quarter? And then if we look forward, how do you expect investor demand for this asset class to evolve and as allocations grow, where are the dollars kind of shifting from? And then, specifically, on the Asia side, what's kind of making the strategy there so attractive to LPs? If you could maybe just touch on some of the deployment opportunities.
Craig Larson: Why don't I begin -- Mike thanks for the question. Why don't I begin first, just as it relates to the overall framework of the infrastructure platform because, you're right, we've seen wonderful growth. So if we look back 3 years ago, AUM was $17 billion. And at 12/31, we were at about $60 billion. So we've gone from $17 billion to $60 billion, all organic. And that, as we're -- again, our infrastructure strategy is a front-burner topic for us as it relates to fundraising. We're also fundraising for a climate strategy. And we also have the wealth products that we've also launched midway through last year that we expect to continue to build in scale. So I think the growth has been really attractive and a lot of momentum. But a lot more for us to do, which is exciting. I think as it relates to Asia, and why don't I touch on that for a moment, it's again interesting to see the statistics there because I think what you're seeing there reflects the growth as well as the diversification you're seeing across the platform. So at the end of 2019, we are looking at these stats over the weekend, we had about $21 billion of AUM in Asia. At the end of '21, we were up to $42 billion and at the end of '23, we're at $65 billion. And so again, if you kind of step back at the end of 2019, we had $21 billion of AUM, almost 90% of that was in private equity. At the end of '23, we're at $65 billion and 51% of that is in private equity. So you've seen meaningful growth for us in the region as well as meaningful diversification across the footprint. And I think just as it relates to broad investment performance, I think it's something that the team is really proud of and we all love to see, obviously, because you've seen strong, consistent results. Across the flagships in particular, we're seeking mid-teens gross low-teens net returns with a 4% to 6% target annualized yield. Infra I and II, our mature funds with performance that exceeds those targets. In Infra III and IV, both earlier in their value creation but are tracking very nicely. I think our most recent fund is actually ahead of I, II and III when you look at the returns in that fund relative to when we made that first investment. So I think the team has been wonderfully disciplined as it relates to the investments we've made. We talk a lot about thematic approaches renewables, digital infrastructure, data centers, fiber networks, all great examples of large critical growing markets where we think we can bring differentiated resources to bear. So again, a lot of progress but a lot of opportunity ahead for us at the same time.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just I think in terms of your question about performance in the quarter, it was broad-based. There's nothing that we use to specifically. The portfolio has been assembled incredibly thoughtfully, as Craig mentioned, and is performing very nicely. And as expected, ahead of expectations. In terms of your question about investor demand where it's shifting from, I mean, for the most part, we've seen people creating allocation to infrastructure over the last several years. It hasn't really been a shift out of other parts of alternatives to some extent, where we've seen alternative allocations to increase, it's to be able to accommodate an infrastructure allocation. And I think a lot of that is investors have focused on the fact you've got a real asset that is mission critical, has an attractive yield. And the way we do it is to have to have that contractual yield and it is inflation protected, so it's also viewed as an inflation hedge. And I think as people have done the work on the space, you've started to see more and more dollars flow into it. So largely speaking, and none of these comments are universal, but largely speaking, it's been an and as opposed to an or. And I think on Asia, Craig hit it. I mean our Asia Infra business has gone from a standing start to $10 billion of AUM in 4 years. We have a great team on the ground. They're leveraging our Pan-Asia presence across our 9 offices. And as you know, we run the firm as one firm, so everybody helps each other. I think that's really allowed us to scale very rapidly in that market. There's a significant amount of capital required to develop infrastructure all across Asia in those themes that Craig just walked you through. And candidly, on the margin, there's less competition in Asia, because fewer firms have built the platform that we've built. So I think large opportunity, fewer competitors, firm well integrated.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask about insurance. I was hoping you might be able to talk about the opportunity to expand the organic insurance origination, how much you expect to do annually there. Maybe talk about some of the opportunities around getting on more platforms, how meaningful could that be at this point. And if interest rates were to come down, what sort of impact might that have for customer demand and origination volumes. Maybe you could also speak to some of the pipelines from new blocks, which you guys have been quite active with.
Rob Lewin: Thanks for the question, Mike. Why don't I start? So over the last few years, our individual business is done, on average, around $10 billion of production. And you're right, you've seen a step-up across the industry, given, I think, higher rates, but I don't think that tells the full story. I think what we're seeing is a real trend towards retirement products. It's probably somewhat agnostic to where interest rates are. And as we think about Global Atlantic and how we're situated specifically in the individual markets, I think there's a lot of share that we continue to take there, getting ramped up on some new platforms, as you suggested. Also historically, Global Atlantic hasn't been as active in the more longer duration fixed annuity market, the 7- to 10-year product. We think there's some market share gains that we can have there. And we do have an expectation that we could take the individual business over time from $10 billion of production to $15 billion to $20 billion of production. Then on the institutional side of our business, there's two components of it. It's not just the block business where we've had a lot of success over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, with MetLife closing in Q4, the Manulife block closing in the first half of the year and a really strong pipeline of opportunity, both domestically and especially internationally. But there's a couple of other aspects of our institutional business that we're really excited about. We've become a real leader in flow reinsurance in the marketplace. Again, that's both domestic and international. And to date, we have very little market share in the pension risk transfer market, where we think the capabilities of our team will really resonate in that market as well. So it's an opportunity for us to take share in what is a large and growing end market. And so when we take it together, it's what gives us the confidence that you would have heard in our November call, really working as one firm to be able to accelerate the growth of the Global Atlantic platform over the next several years. Now an important part of that growth, and I referenced in our prepared remarks, relates to our ability to also be able to access third-party capital. And so our Ivy funds and strategies is a big part of where we're going as an organization. We've got a lot of momentum there. As I mentioned earlier, 75% of the capital required in the two block deals that we've got in flight right now, the MetLife one that just closed and Manulife is going to be funded by third parties, by outside investors. And we think that combination of GA balance sheet capital and third-party investors is really what the optimal structure looks like, especially for the institutional side of our business going forward.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from the line of Bill Katz of TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Katz: I just want to circle back to capital management for a moment. Certainly appreciate you just raised the dividend by 6%. But if I start doing the math and look out to $4.50 of earnings power, and Rob, to your point, that more and more of your business is going to be more recurring in nature, and then just sort of think about sort of low single-digit type of dividend hikes that's been sort of more recent past, your dividend payout ratio is going to drop pretty dramatically and then the yield on the stock is going to be relatively negligible. How are you thinking about cap return? I know there was a big discussion point at the November update. It's a rich man's issue, I presume. But how do we think about maybe priorities from here capital return versus deployment strategically?
Craig Larson: Sure. Thanks, Bill. So why don't I start on the dividend policy and then just, I think, more importantly, talk about our overall approach to capital allocation, which is of equal importance. So on dividend policy, we really like our policy a lot. We started with a fixed dividend of $0.50 annually when we converted to a C Corp 5 years ago. And every year, we have increased that dividend. And we believe we've got the visibility going forward to have consistent and stable growth to our dividend. And so we like our dividend policy. Now a big reason why we have the dividend policy that we have is because we see so much opportunity to be able to invest back into KKR's business for growth. And you've heard us talk about our capital allocation policy for some time in a very consistent way. And I don't think there's anything more important from the capital allocation policy than being consistent. And our approach is to optimize for recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share. And we've talked about 4 core areas, strategic areas of deployment from our excess free cash flow back into our business. And those are going to come in insurance, core private equity, strategic M&A and share buybacks. And so I think we feel very fortunate that because of the business model we have, the brand we have, the access to capital we have and distribution, that we've got the opportunity to be able to invest back into our business at high levels of ROE that are going to drive really recurring and growth-oriented earnings per share over a long period of time for our investors. So that's our focus. We feel really good about our approach to capital allocation. I think it's a real core competency of our management team and think that that's what's going to drive the highest amount of ultimate shareholder accretion for a long period of time. And of course, it's very much a highly aligned decision since the management team of KKR own 25-plus percent of the stock.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Rob, thanks for your help. And thank you, everyone, for joining this call. We know that with our announcements that we made in late November, earnings today and with Investor Day on the horizon on April 10, we're asking everyone to spend a healthy amount of time on all things KKR. Just want to thank everybody in advance for investing the time. Look forward again in particular to the deep dive on April 10. And if you have any questions following this call, please, of course, reach out to us directly. Thank you so much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So to begin, I'm going to walk through the quarter's financial results before Rob discusses our key operating metrics.  Turning to our results for the quarter, we're pleased to be reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.63, and after tax distributable earnings of $0.88 per share. Management fees in the quarter came in at $759 million. This was up 13%, compared to Q3 of 2022, and up 16% over the trailing 12 months. Real assets management fees have been a bright spot for us, increasing 6% compared to last quarter, and 25% over the last 12 months, driven by growth across several infrastructure and real estate strategies.  Net transaction and monitoring fees were $124 million in the quarter, $100 million of which came from our capital markets business. Fee-related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5% of fee-related revenues. Other operating expenses were $142 million. This expense figure is actually a little lower compared to both last quarter as well as Q3 of 2022. Here you're really seeing us continue to invest for growth, while maintaining our discipline at the same time.  So putting this together, fee-related earnings came in at $558 million or the $0.63 per share figure I mentioned a moment ago. In Q3, our FRE margin was 61.7%. We've talked consistently about our FRE margin being in this low-60s areas, and we've delivered on this. This is the 12th consecutive quarter where that margin has been at or above the 60% level. And we continue to feel very good about this migrating up from here into the mid-60s.  Realized performance income was $329 million and realized investment income generated $231 million. Both realized performance and investment income together were up over 2x from last quarter as exit activity increased in both our private equity as well as our U.S. real estate businesses. Realized performance investment income compensation ratios were again both right at the midpoint in the quarter. So in total, our asset management operating earnings were $869 million.  Global Atlantic again had a very strong quarter with our insurance segment generating $210 million of pre-tax earnings. To spend a moment on GA, on the institutional front. GA's blocked reinsurance transaction with MetLife remains on track to close in Q4 2023. We disclosed this transaction on last quarter's call. We expect our AUM to increase by approximately $13 billion upon closing and looking farther ahead GA's pipeline and level of dialogue on future block activity remains healthy. And in terms of GA's individual business, GA experienced an increase in activity in Q3. So overall business momentum within this channel continues to feel very good as well.  Global Atlantic AUM pro forma for the MetLife block now totals $158 million. This is up from $72 billion or over two times since the announcement of our acquisition in July of 2020. In our view, this really demonstrates the strength of GA franchise, the power of the KKR, GA partnership, as well as the high level of execution we've seen since the onset. So back to our P&L, in aggregate after tax distributable earnings totaled $780 million, or $0.88 per share.  Next, just turning to page 7 of our earnings release, you see investment performance summarized for the quarter as well as the trailing 12-month periods. Looking at the figures on the page for the third quarter, our performance metrics broadly compare very favorably relative to public indices, which were mixed in the quarter. The traditional private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter, and over the 12 months is up 12%. And looking to add our inception to-date blended IRR for our most recent flagship funds, that figure continues to stay strong at 23%.  In real assets, the real estate portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and down 9% over the last 12 months. Importantly, underlying NOI growth has remained strong across our portfolios. So the decline you see over the trailing 12 months reflects the change in interest rates as well as cap rate assumptions. Infrastructure was up 3% in the quarter and is up 14% over the last 12 months, as this asset class has continued to be resilient for us.  In credit, the leveraged and alternative composites were both up 3% in the quarter, and 14% and 9%, respectively over the last 12 months. And turning for a moment to page 25, our core private equity portfolio has performed. Today, we're the largest manager of core PE capital with $35 billion of AUM, which includes third party capital alongside of our balance sheet. And as you can see on the page, the fair value of investments we've made off the balance sheet at 9/30 was $6.5 billion.  As a reminder, core PE is a long duration investment strategy. We expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15 plus years. These investments generally have lower leverage over their hold periods compared to traditional PE and are more cash generative. The portfolio this at this point is global, spans a wide range of industries. So we've continued to see strong growth in the portfolio that in our view is more stable and less cyclical in nature, which has really helped during periods of dislocation, such as the early stages of COVID, as well as over the last 12 to 18 months.  We got into this asset class, and have really treated it as a strategic growth avenue for us since we started. Because it's an area where we firmly believe that our business model, including our industry depth, geographic breadth, collaborative culture, and ability to drive business building all set us up very well to be the best global player in the asset class. We're big believers in the earnings power this strategy can create, and we continue to think about how to unlock that potential.  And with that summary, I'll turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I thought it'd be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing across the firm day-to-day. Despite what has been a dynamic operating environment, we find ourselves with a significant amount of momentum, especially across our key strategic growth areas. We are seeing a noticeable uptick in our pipelines around fundraising, deployment and monetizations. And I'll take you through each today.  Turning first to fundraising. This quarter, we raised $14 billion, bringing the past 12 months to $54 billion. While the fundraising environment has been tough, we feel as though we're positioned very differently than a number of our peers. None of the $54 billion that we have raised over the LTM period has come from our flagship strategies, which are due to begin fundraising in the next year or so.  Global Atlantic continues to have a lot of success in this rate environment and remains incredibly well positioned. Across our private wealth strategies, while still early, our momentum is strong. And our conviction around the size of the addressable market, and our ability to take share continue to grow. And in the framework of KKR this is really all upside for us from here. Finally, many of our younger strategies continue to scale.  Looking at the quarter in a bit more detail, first our K series suite of products. As a reminder, these primarily serve the private wealth and market globally, providing individuals with access to alternative investments that have traditionally have not been accessible to non institutional clients. We now have vehicles for all four of our major asset classes; private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. And we continue to be added to more private wealth platforms as these vehicles ramp. Two years ago, we were on approximately 10 platforms. And today that number is closer to 40 across the suite of products that we manage, with more to come.  Looking at our private equity and infra wealth product specifically, they are now raising approximately $500 million a month. So really strong start for us, especially relative to our expectations, only reinforcing our confidence in the scale and impact of the long term opportunity here. Second, we raised $1 billion of capital in credit and liquid strategies in the quarter, and we were particularly active in private credit. As a reminder, private credit is comprised of our direct lending, and our asset-based finance businesses where AUM has scaled significantly.  Today, in total, private credit AUM is $83 billion. That's up roughly three times from $25 billion just three years ago. In direct lending, where we have $36 billion of assets under management, you're seeing us raise capital in a variety of forms. In the quarter, we raised capital for our U.S. focused strategy in traditional fund format. And through evergreen structures in both the U.S. as well as in Europe. We're seeing more interest in these perpetual vehicles, as the asset classes become more mature, and a more permanent part of institutions' allocations.  And we're at the outset of fundraising for our private VDC and continue to raise capital in our separately managed accounts. In asset-based finance, we're continuing to build on our leadership position here. ABF is now close to $50 billion of AUM as of 9/30. We are raising capital in a variety of forms, including closed end and open ended fund structures, in both our high grade and opportunistic ABS strategies. There'll be more to come here in future quarters, as interest in both direct lending and ABF remains very high. This all really builds on the back of strong performance within our leverage credit business, with many of our investment strategies ranking at the top of their respective peer categories.  As an example, our investment returns in both our opportunistic leverage credit strategy, and our multi-asset credit strategy rank in the top one percentile against their peer universes since their inception in 2008.  And the third area on fundraising I wanted to address for some of the more recent announcements that happened post 9/30. We held the final close in Next Generation Technology 3 at approximately $3 billion. That represents an over 30% increase to its predecessor fund. Global Impact Fund 2 is our growth equity platform, investing behind proven companies that delivers scalable commercial solutions to global problems, also held its final close post-quarter end, totaling $2.8 billion, which is over twice the size of its predecessor fund. And Asia Infrastructure 2, we have already raised $6.1 billion of capital here, making it the largest dedicated infra fund in the region, and up from the $3.8 billion predecessor fund. And we have not yet held the final close.  This is another sizable platform that we have added to our infrastructure franchise, and I think further cements our leadership position in Asia more broadly. These three funds in aggregate have increased from $7 billion across their prior vintages to approximately $12 billion of total capital today. This is all very high margin AUM for us, and in strategies that are still relatively young for KKR.  As we look to 2024 and 2025, we expect fundraising at KKR will accelerate relative to the last 12 months. We have 30 plus strategies in or coming to market, including a number of flagships such as global infrastructure, America's Private Equity and Asia Private Equity, with the opportunity for continued scaling in our private wealth products alongside the traditional fund format.  We are also launching a new climate investing strategy. We have recruited a really talented and experienced team, which is now fully integrated into a broader infrastructure platform, giving us confidence that we can become a real leader and a skilled player in the space.  Moving next to deployment, we continue to be very constructive on risk reward here across a number of our asset classes. We have about $100 billion of dry powder available to deploy. And we've seen an uptick in announced investment activity since June. However, only a small portion of that closed in the 90 days ended September 30. We do expect an increase in investment activity in Q4, given our pipelines here. This dynamic should help the invested capital figures in addition to our capital markets revenues in Q4.  And finally our monetization activity has continued to pick up. In the quarter our realized performance and investment income totaled $560 million. Activity in the quarter came from a wide variety of strategies and products. And as we look into the fourth quarter, standing here today, we currently have visibility on $400-plus million of monetization related revenue.  One of the realizations in Q4 is from our investment in KOKUSAI ELECTRIC. KOKUSAI is a Japan-based manufacturer of semiconductor production equipment. We invested in the business back in December of 2017 through our Asia private equity platform. It is one of the three carve-out transactions where we've collaborated with the Hitachi Group. You've heard us talk about Japanese carve-outs as a key investment team, a number of times on these calls. Given our operational skills together with our relationships in the region, we feel particularly well positioned to pursue these investments. This is just the latest example for us.  At the end of October, KOKUSAI was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the largest IPO in Japan since 2018, and the largest ever private equity backed IDM. The stock has performed well since pricing, trading up approximately 35%. And based on last week's closing price, our total investment is now marked at over 15 times multiple money on a gross basis. We continue to own 40% of the company. In addition to the positive outcome for our Asia private equity investors, the IPO also helps our branding across everything that we do in Japan, and likely as a result also creates more opportunity as we distribute K series products in this market.  Turning to the firm as a whole, we still have $11-plus billion of embedded gains between our investments and carried interest. So the future around monetization-related revenue remains robust. This is compared to $9 billion of embedded gains at the beginning of the year. So we're up roughly 25% in and what has been a volatile environment, while at the same time having monetized the healthy amount of that embedded gain since 12/31.  As you can hear, we continue to be really excited as a management team about our growth and our evolution. We've been executing on our plan of building a very high growth and high margin asset management business, which benefits from, and is accelerated by what we are doing across insurance and core private equity.  With that Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And the first question is can the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question?
Craig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, Scott, Rob. I hope everyone's doing well. 
Scott Nuttall: Good morning, Craig. 
Craig Siegenthaler: So two weeks ago, the press was reporting that at KKR entered into a relationship with two of the mega online brokers to sell some of your retail vehicles. Now this approach is different than the wirehouses, which are mainly selling your products like KREST, to high net worth investors. And so I believe this is mainly focused on the massive flow, and so I was wondering if you could provide an update on one, this strategy and what you're looking to accomplish.
Scott Nuttall: Craig, you want to kick off? 
Craig Larson : Sure. Hey, Craig. Why don't I start off? I think the main takeaway from what you're mentioning is the focus we have on broadening the funnel at the top end. And we're going to be focused on the wirehouses. Here in the U.S., we're going to be focused on independent broker dealers. We're going to be focused on broad private wealth internationally. And the products that we've created are ones that are going to be designed and tailored for those markets, different markets geographically, and again, with a focus on broadening the funnel as much as we can.  One of the topics we've been particularly focused on was making sure that we could appeal not only to the qualified purchaser market but the accredited investor market. Again, accredited investor market is eight or nine times the size of the qualified purchaser market. So again, that's just one example of a focus for us as is again, just one wanting to broaden that funnel at the top end as much as we can.
Robert Lewin : Yeah the only thing I'd add Craig, I think it's just part of the strategy. Our approach is really quite broad based. It's global. It's multi-channel all around the world. So what got picked up was just one element of that in the U.S.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Let's focus on, I guess GA a little bit. I heard your comments about potential for more blocks ahead. In the quarter the cost of insurance went up a little bit more than the net investment income. I'm curious on your thoughts on how a higher for longer environment A, plays into that dynamic and B, plays into your distribution mix. And whether or not you saw much impact from the DOL rules that have been floated out there? Thanks very much.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah, Glenn, thanks a lot for the question. I take a step back, and we're seeing a lot of momentum across really, all aspects of GA right now. Year-over-year bases are operating and comes up close to 30% in the business. We're seeing success distributing through the individual channel, through the institutional channel, while of course, we've seen cost of insurance tick up over the past 12 months, given where crediting rates are and products I think you've also seen a commensurate step up in net investment income as well.  And if you look quarter-over-quarter, our net investment income margin ticked up a little bit north of where cost of insurance was. And so net-net we came in about 15 basis points higher on return on asset basis in GA.  So we're feeling like the team is executing across all aspects of their business right now. You mentioned the DOL rules. I'm glad you brought that up. A punch line from our perspective is based on the draft regs that we have seen. We don't expect this to have a material impact on our business going forward. In many ways, the draft regs are similar to what came out in 2016. So I think the industry is well prepared for that, GA is well prepared for that. 90%-plus of our distribution today is through the bank and broker dealer channel. We feel to this channel that's most prepared to be able to deal with wherever the regulations come out.  But I think it's important to note that fundamentally we support what the regulator here is trying to accomplish. They want to make sure that consumers get the value they're paying for when they buy an investment product. And I think that's good for everybody in the space. So punch line, no material issues. And we continue to work very closely with the GA team to continue the momentum there.
Operator: Next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Pleased proceed with your question.
Steven Chubak: Hi, good morning, Scott. Good morning, Rob. 
Scott Nuttall: Good morning. 
Robert Lewin : Good morning. 
Steven Chubak: So wanted to start off with a question on capital markets where activity continues to be subdued. But as we think about what the business could generate in a more normalized environment, the growth in your PE real asset AUM versus the average level in '19, so pre COVID baseline suggests normalized capital markets fees could be about 160% higher than 2019 levels. So closer to about a $1.2 billion fee bogey. And I was hoping you could frame what your view is on normalized capital markets activity, what that might look like, and is the increase in AUM the right lens for assessing the potential upside here? 
Robert Lewin : Great, thanks a lot for the question. So a couple things on our capital markets business, and maybe I'll just start with this year and then frame how we think about the go forward. So as you look at really 2022 and 2023, we've been a really tough operating environment for much of that period of time. IPO markets have been largely shut, secondary markets have been close to shut. The leveraged finance market has been up and down. But certainly more down than up. And we're really proud of how that business has protected revenue in that down market. If you look, we were mid-$500 million (phon) in terms of revenue last year, while year-to-date, we're averaging about $110 million $120 million a quarter in that range.  We do feel good about where our pipeline suggests our revenue should be in Q4. And so feel like the team has done a great job being able to protect revenue in a down market. Now. Mike, I think you raised an important question around more normalized environment. If you look at 2021, we generated $840 million of revenue in our capital markets business. And as you suggest, we're doing more things today as a firm than we did in 2021. And I think we've got an opportunity to greater share with a third party component of our capital markets franchise. So we look at a more normalized environment.  We feel like that plus or minus $200 million a quarter is very achievable but to us that's not the top end. We're building out a platform that we think over time can have real growth off that number.  In terms of forward-looking indicators. AUM could be one, but I think it's really the scale and breadth of what we're doing across the firm or maybe more the breadth of what we're doing across the firm, as opposed to necessarily the scale. It's our ability to take share in the third party part of our business where we think we've got some real competitive differentiators versus the marketplace. I think those are more what the indicators are to watch for growth than necessarily what the AUM is for the firm. But thanks for the question.  It's a part of our business that we feel really good about right now, the experience of the past 21 months relative to what it could have been or what it would have been in past cycles that really speaks to what our team has built over the past 10 plus years.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah, thanks for the question, Stephen. There's no doubt the baseline for the capital markets business has gone up materially over the last few years. I think AUM is one metric you could look to. You could also look to deployment. And frankly, you could also to some extent look to monetization, as the capital markets business often participates in particularly our public market exits. So I'd probably look at those few things. As Rob said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing activity pick up in the fourth quarter across those areas. So we'd expect that to flow through to the capital markets business as well.
Operator: Our next question's from the line of Alex Borstein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question as well. I was hoping we could talk for a couple of minutes around the interplay between your deployment comments in the coming quarter and the quarters ahead. And the flagship fundraising cycle, especially as it relates to some of the bigger funds like the Global Infra in North America and Asia. So the North American and Asia, particular still seems to have lots of dry powder. So maybe help us frame what kind of deployment outlook you're seeing for those strategies, and how that informs your view on when you can come back to the market with the next impetus? Thanks,
Craig Larson: Hey, Alex. It's Craig, thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here. First, when you look at the fun table in the back of our press release, the numbers you see on an invested basis will, if anything, be understated, as if we have dollars that are committed to an investment, those dollars actually won't show up in that table until those dollars are actually called and invested. So I think as you look at where we are in terms of the status of those funds, fraught [ph] and invested in committed basis, we're actually farther along than you might think that just by looking at those -- at that table on a face value.  And in terms of broad timing, nothing to announce specifically here. But we do expect over '24 and '25, that we will be active in both of those and that activity will supplement infrastructure for us, which is a front burner topic, as well as climate and on those last few we expect we'll be able to give some updates on those in the first half of next year. So again, just feels like our fundraising team is going to continue to be very active.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. 
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I appreciate the strong trends at Global Atlantic you highlighted. But the May deck they put out suggested some fairly significant offsetting outflows there. So understanding you have $13 billion coming in, in 4Q But could you also give a little more specifics on how the regular way retail flows versus lapses and other outflow items have been tracking at Global Atlantic? Thank you. 
Robert Lewin : Yes, Patrick. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question. As we look forward in our business, really, the way I think about it, is in regular way organic part of our business, in the individual side, as we look at '24 that could be in that $10 billion to $15 billion range of organic flows. The institutional part of our business, again, more in that organic flow basis, probably in that plus or minus $10 billion range. And the outflows call it in the mid-teens. And so on a net basis, organically, we feel like GA should have, call it $5 billion to $10 billion of organic growth next year. Now you layer on top of that block activity as an example of the MetLife Block, which is all incremental and upside to that.  As we look at our pipeline on the block side, it feels as good today, as it has since we started our ownership of Global Atlantic. We're seeing some very specific deals out there where we can really partner with close relationships and be able to come up with win-win solutions for both us and our clients and partners in that space.  And so that's really how I would think about Global Atlantic and its ability to grow over the coming 12 months, both organically and then on the block side. We continue to see real momentum there, offset, of course, as you noted, by regular way withdrawals.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add Patrick, because I wouldn't get too focused on any shorter period of time, since the deal was announced in 2020 GA's assets have gone from $72 billion to now pro forma for MetLife, $158 billion. So we've meaningfully exceeded all of our expectations in terms of net growth and we expect to see very consistent trends going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Mckenna: Great, thanks. So you've recently announced a partnership with a life science investment firm. So could you talk about this investment a little bit, what the broader opportunity is within life sciences, how this partnership tellers growth in this part of the market? And then how it plays into the longer-term healthcare strategy at KKR?
Robert Lewin : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll start. And so I think as you know, we've got a $4 plus billion healthcare growth strategy at the firm. We've got a big private equity focused on the healthcare space and our investment in Katalio [ph], which is really a leading life science investment firm at the more earlier stage, is a real partnership that we think can help make their business better, and then also make our business better from an origination perspective. And we think we'll get a very nice return on our capital based on their business growth and the ability to help originate flow for both our healthcare growth strategy as well as potentially our private equity strategy, maybe strategies across our credit business, a big reason why we did that transaction.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian is, we started our health care growth strategy a handful of years ago. That has exceeded our expectations to date. There's really two areas where we've been focused on leading from the standpoint of just newer business creation more recently. One is climate, which the guys mentioned, and the other is this life sciences space where we think there could be a meaningful opportunity for us over time. Katalio and that partnership is just part of that effort.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about Global Atlantic. There was some press earlier, I think, last month about the possibility that KKR might have to buy back the ownership stakes from some of the old Goldman Sachs Asset Management clients. I was wondering if you could speak to that. Is there any truth to it, and if not, could you at least remind us of how that arrangement works and what we should think about or expect going forward? Thank you.
Robert Lewin : Yes. Thanks for asking that question. I'm glad you asked it because I know when that article came out, Craig Larson and his team got a lot of inbounds and questions. And since the shareholder agreement is not public, there is only so much color that him and his team are able to provide. To be very clear, KKR has got no contractual obligation to buy out the minority shareholders at Global Atlantic. What we do have is an obligation in the future to the extent that they want to seek liquidity to help them in that process, which of course, we'd be happy to do.  So no obligation on our part in any way. But of course, that option remains open to us in the future as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to focus on the FRE margin comment. I think, Craig, you started off with that in your prepared remarks, the migration up to the mid-60s from the low 60s. Can you just talk a little bit about the timing around that? And is it mostly a scale-based improvement? And so therefore, does that require the flagship fundraising cycles to come in? And then I guess, just strategically, how you think about that in terms of -- versus investing in growth initiatives? And I think the big one I'm thinking about is the wealth distribution, particularly if you're having good traction there. Is that something that you're sort of happy to spend into to grow that, and maybe delay the improvements in the mid-60s?
Robert Lewin : Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll start. So I think we can do both is the short answer. I think we can invest into the firm for growth like we've been doing and expand our margins. No timetable as at least today to when we think we can achieve that mid-60 sustainable FRE margin. But I can tell you sitting here today, I have more confidence than I ever have in our ability to be able to achieve that over time.  I also -- I don't think that's the cap for us. As we look at the business that we're building across our asset management platform, I think there's opportunity over the long term to expand margins north of that mid-60% level. But one step at a time. We've got, again, a lot of conviction that we're going to be able to achieve that on a more sustainable basis, and we'll give you updates, of course, on our progress.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Brown : Great, I want to ask on the 2026 targets. Clearly, the growth from your next flagship fund raising campaign and the margin comments you just made Rob will put you on a visible path to that 2026 FRE target, but can you maybe help me unpack the key drivers to the doubling of DE.  So I assume -- if I assume GA can maybe grow at like a low teens growth rate and maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but if I use that assumption and then I assume --it seems to imply, I guess, a meaningful ramp in the performance fees. Is that the right way to think about the building blocks? And then what kind of gives you confidence that you'll get to that performance fee contribution piece since that's somewhat out of your control? Thank you.
Robert Lewin : Great. Thanks for the question, Mike. So I think it's really multiple different factors. I think it's FRE growth, as you stated, and we can unpack that a little bit. And we definitely see further opportunities to grow and expand what we're doing with Global Atlantic to increase our earnings contribution from there. And then it's our $11 billion plus of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet today. And that gives us a great deal of comfort in terms of our forward-looking earnings power. So it's a combination of those three things working together that ultimately gives us confidence in our numbers. And we said it last call, and I'll reiterate this call, we feel more comfortable today than we did when we initiated that guidance, I think, two years ago now in our ability to achieve our numbers. And I think that's saying quite a bit because if you think about what's happened at least in our space since we initiated that guidance two years ago, we've had very tough overall operating conditions. Tough fundraising market, tough overall monetization, volatile marks across the board, but we're sitting here now telling you two years in that we feel, even in spite of that, more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our targets.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Let me pick up, Mike and I appreciate you asking the question about '26. Inside the firm, it just feels really optimistic, candidly. We've got a lot of different ways to grow. As Rob and Craig mentioned, we've been raising a lot of capital, but our flagship fundraises have not been in those numbers and those are coming. We have a lot of younger and scaling strategies, and I'm not sure it's fully appreciated just how young the firm is. But if you look at the last 12 months, nearly 80% of the money we've raised has been from strategies less than five years old. If you look at the next 12 to 18 months, there's roughly 30 different strategies we will be in the market with, 22 of those are Fund 1, 2 or 3 or equivalent. So we're quite young, and we've been able to scale through the cycle. And as we gain more traction and find our way at that inflection part of the curve, we see a lot of upside as these businesses start to get closer to top three in everything we're doing. Private Wealth is newer for us. So we have a lot of upside ahead of us. GA, we talked about. Asia has significant growth opportunities as well. So the reason you're hearing the optimism is probably 5 to 10 years ago, we were talking about all these businesses that we started that would take 10 plus years to get to scale. And a lot of that is just starting to happen in this period of time, which is why despite the operating environment, we're still quite optimistic.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on private credit with the new bank capital rules. Just curious how you see that opportunity set, potentially unfolding. Any particular areas you view as most attractive coming out of the banks versus less attractive for KKR? And are there any steps you guys need to take at this point in order to capture that? Any gaps you need to fill in? And then just a housekeeping question for Rob, just on the deployment and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter. Thank you.
Robert Lewin : Why don't I start with the deployment and realization and Craig will take up on some of the private credit related questions. So Mike this quarter, we're roughly $300 million of deployment and $300 million monetization of our balance sheet. Say, on the deployment side, it's pretty broad-based across our platform on the monetization side, maybe a little bit heavier weighting towards real assets.
Craig Larson : And Mike, it's Craig. Just in terms of on the bank topic. Look, I think our team remains very active as it relates to finding opportunities with the banks. You would have seen a press release in Q3 focused on the acquisition of a portfolio from a regional bank through our ABF platform, and that activity will continue. When you take a step back and look at our platform, excuse me, we're over $80 billion of private credit AUM, $47 million in asset based finance and $36 million in direct lending. And if you think of asset-based finance for a moment, it's a $5 trillion market opportunity, and there are real secular tailwinds at play here. And in our view, against this really enormous opportunity, you've got a lack of scale capital. At the same time, as you know, many traditional providers are even further retrenching. So it's an area that I think we would highlight we just think we're really well positioned to continue to drive real long-term growth here.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Mike, and you asked if there's any gaps. There's nothing that I would point to in terms of a gap. We've got a big organic build opportunity here.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. I guess I wonder if you could spend a minute or two talking about your approach to the real estate businesses, both in the United States and globally. I mean your latest flagship fund in the United States has been mostly invested already. And on the one hand, I guess it just doesn't feel like we are anywhere near the end of the cycle in office or in the -- concerns about the impact of rising rates. But on the other hand, every commercial bank in the world is trying to reduce their exposure to real estate.  So this is usually the kind of environment where private equity sponsors can thrive. So what's your general view on real estate? Is it still time to be cautious and defensive or is this the time to lean in?
Craig Larson : Yes. Why don't I start with the platform overall, and then I'm sure Scott will add on as it relates to opportunities and the tone of the team and the environment. Just to level set, we're $65 billion of AUM today with a very good balance between real estate equity and real estate credit. So we have round numbers, $30 billion in equity, $35 billion in credit. We have opportunistic strategies across the U.S., Europe, Asia. In the U.S., we have a core plus vehicle that's now expanded into Europe. We have half dozen or so credit vehicles. So it's a global business across multiple strategies, fully integrated that can create solutions up and down the capital structure across equity and debt in the U.S., Europe and Asia. And that's how we're situated against the opportunity. Now your point on the current environment is one that's really interesting because we think in the go forward looking over the coming 12, 24 months, we're very constructive on those opportunities. I think, as it relates to a couple of those. I think, first, look there is a wave of maturities and capital needs that are coming, and this is not U.S. office.  These are assets that are in very strong performing sectors. I think excellent assets but excellent assets with very levered capital structures. And this is going to take some time to work through, but this is an example of an opportunity that we're very actively talking about with our limited partners as we see and think through opportunities ahead in terms of our opportunistic pools of capital.  And the second I'd mention again would be real estate credit. So the dislocations that in our view, are creating really interesting opportunities. You have high base rates, spreads have widened meaningfully for new credit originations, terms have tightened. And so today's CRE loans have lower LTVs, better interest coverage, higher interest rates with more lender-friendly covenant and structures. So if you were to look back two plus years ago, at those subordinated tranches, pricing would have moved up from the low to single mid digits two years ago to low double digits today. And again, in our view, taking less risk with more LCVs and better terms. So I think as we think of how we're situated, we're very constructive and think we're in a position to be forward-leaning. I'll let you pick it up from there.
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. Look we started our real estate platform, probably 10 to 12 years ago, somewhere in there, call it, 2011, '12, Chris. And we've been building that business over a period of time where obviously, rates were dropping. We are seeing a significant move in cap rates in one direction. I think our team has been incredibly thoughtful about how they built the business. It's been very thematically focused, perhaps our most thematic investing business across the firm. As a result, very careful about where they were deploying capital as a result. We don't really have much U.S. office exposure. That's just one example. But we've been building across opportunistic equity, to your point about the fund table, core plus real estate, and we have a very large real estate credit business. So in terms of kind of where we stand, we're continuing to raise capital. I think the real estate credit opportunity is showing up, to Craig's point, before the opportunity gets really interesting. But we think that will be even more interesting with time. And so we are continuing to raise capital, deploying selectively all around the world and getting ready for things to get even more attractive as we head into the next several quarters. And one of the ways we've been able to grow this business is through Global Atlantic, which we expect to continue to be the case. So we're really optimistic about what this business can be. And I think you're right. It's periods of time like this where you can grow significantly especially if we continue to see valuations under pressure.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Mckenna: Thanks for the follow-up. Just two quick items for Rob, interest income and dividend line kicked up in the quarter. What drove this? And is the $120 million quarterly run rate level a good starting point moving forward? And how the $400 million plus of monetization slated for the fourth quarter how much of that is tied to Marshall Wace?
Robert Lewin : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. Some of the interest in dividends is just honestly, a function of rates coming up and where beneficiaries at on our cash balances and some of our floating rate exposure on the balance sheet. As it relates to $400-plus million, I would say, call it, 80% of that is more carried interest and 20% of that would be balance sheet income and our incentive fee from Marshall Wace in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson : Rob, first, thank you for your help. Thank you, everybody for your interest in KKR. We know this is a very busy earnings period for everybody. If you have any additional questions, please follow-up with us directly. Otherwise, we'll speak with everybody in 90 days. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I’ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. Turning now to the quarter. We're pleased to be reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.67 and after tax distributable earnings of $0.73 per share. I'm going to begin by walking through the financials. Management fees in the quarter came in at $749 million; net transaction and monitoring fees were $190 million in Q2, with capital markets generating $150 million of revenues. Capital markets activity was most pronounced in our infrastructure business, which contributed approximately 45% of revenues in the quarter. And along with core private equity, these two strategies generated over 60% of capital markets transaction fees in the quarter, reflecting the continued diversification of the business. So, in total, fee-related revenues were $967 million. This was up 7% from last quarter, and it's up 25% year-over-year. Fee-related compensation was right at the midpoint of our guided range at 22.5% of fee-related revenues and other operating expenses were $147 million. Putting this together, fee-related earnings came in at $602 million or $0.67 per share with an FRE margin of 62%, which continues to be best-in-class looking across our industry. And for the quarter, FRE improved 10% from last quarter and on a year-over-year basis, so this is compared to the second quarter of 2022, FRE is up 31%. Moving to realized performance income. Realization activity, as we discussed last quarter, was more muted against the slower transaction environment. So, for the quarter, we generated $149 million of realized performance income, while realized investment income came in at $115 million. In total, our asset management operating earnings were $752 million. Our Insurance segment generated $170 million of pretax earnings in the quarter as Global Atlantic continues to operate at a high level. As a reminder, we expect pretax ROE to be in that 14% to 15% range, so performance this quarter was just above the top end of that range. In aggregate, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $653 million or the $0.73 per share figure that I mentioned a minute ago. Next, moving to investment performance. The traditional private equity portfolio was up 5% in the quarter and over the last 12 months appreciated 2%. Importantly here, inception to date, IRRs for our blended flagship funds, so that's Americas XII, Europe V and Asia IV remains strong at 22%, which is meaningfully ahead of the corresponding 9% figure for the MSCI world. In real assets, the real estate portfolio was flat for the quarter and down 11% over the last 12 months. Our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted towards those assets and themes where you're seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth. So, think industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing, and self-storage. However, as cap rates have increased over the last 12 months, that more than offset the underlying NOI growth and that's what's leading to the decline you've seen over the LTM period. Infrastructure was up 2% in the quarter and up 10% over the last 12 months, reflecting the strength of the portfolio really on a global basis. And with higher interest rates, we've strategically leaned into more inflation protected assets. And in credit, the leveraged in alternative composites were up 3% and 2%, respectively for the quarter and 12% and 5%, respectively over the last 12 months. Moving next to capital metrics. We raised $13 billion in the quarter. Fundraising activity was actually quite diverse, driven by our middle market private equity strategy. Our case series suite of products focused on private wealth, which Rob is going to touch further on in a moment. Our core infrastructure strategy and real estate across all geographies, and this is in addition to inflows from Global Atlantic as well as capital raised for our Ivy reinsurance sidecar fund, which held its final close in the quarter. With that, our assets under management increased to $519 billion and fee paying AUM to $420 billion. And finally, we've continued to deploy capital. In the quarter, we invested approximately $10 billion, pretty evenly spread across private equity, real assets and credit. Deployment within private equity was largely driven by core PE, while real estate deployment was most focused on credit in the U.S. as well as equity investments in Asia. And in our credit business, deployment was relatively diversified across asset-based finance and direct lending. Now, before turning it over to Rob, we want to spend a minute or two on our work to create and protect value through sustainability, which we detailed in our 12th annual sustainability report that we published in June and is also available on our website. Now, one of the areas where we've shown real leadership is our work around broad-based employee ownership in our portfolio companies and billing off of the CHI overhead doors and Minnesota rubber and plastics examples discussed previously, we've another case study in RBmedia. RBmedia is one of the largest audiobook publishers in the world, and in connection with our investment, we introduced a broad equity ownership program across the company. And by partnering with the workforce and through all of their great work, wonderful things have happened, including a 22% CAGR in its core publishing business EBITDA over the life of our investment. So, we announced the sale of RBmedia in late July, and this will be a very successful outcome for its employees. All RBmedia colleagues will earn significant cash payouts with non-management employees receiving a 100% of annual income on average, and the most tenured employees receiving two years of their annual income. This outcome can be a financial game changer for people, and it's driving real value. Over these three recent exits, we've averaged approximately a 6x multiple of costs on behalf of our clients. So, at this point we've introduced broad-based employee ownership programs at over 35 companies and we've touched over 60,000 employees. And we expect these numbers to continue to grow from here and hope and expect we'll have more stories like RBmedia to share with you in the quarters and years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Craig. The operating backdrop has begun to improve and as Craig just ran through, our model continues to deliver consistent results. With that, let's shift the focus of the conversation to the future. Our model, growth trajectory, and culture are differentiated within our industry. I thought it would be beneficial to go through three of the foundational building blocks that have driven much of our differentiation and will importantly be a key driver of KKR's future earnings quality and growth. We have taken very deliberate steps to build a business that benefits from several different growth engines, providing both greater earnings stability and significant long-term earnings power. Number one, we've built a business that has meaningfully increased the durability and recurring nature of our revenues, and we expect that trend to continue. Page four of the earnings release highlights this point very well. On the left hand side of the page, you see that over just the past two and a half years, we have doubled our management fees, our most recurrent revenue stream from $1.4 billion in 2020 to $2.9 billion over the last 12 months, and fee-related earnings in turn have also increased meaningfully from $1.3 billion in 2020 to approximately $2.3 billion over the prior 12 months. Alongside this growth, the quality of these earnings has significantly improved as we've become much more diversified by strategy and by geography. In addition, the form of our capital base has also evolved, with our perpetual capital increasing from $22 billion at the end of 2020 to $200 billion today. Our perpetual capital now accounts for roughly 50% of our fee paying AUM relative to approximately 10% at the end of 2020. We will continue this focus of increasing both our recurring revenue and profitability, as well as diversifying the form of our fundraising and capital base. The second building block are the multiple identifiable growth avenues at across our business. We have discussed a number of these drivers over the last couple of earnings calls, but today I'm going to focus on just two areas that have been more notable in the quarter. Insurance and private wealth. Global Atlantic has continued to be a fantastic acquisition for us. Looking at the past few months, we've highlight two very important initiatives. In May GA announced a reinsurance agreement with MetLife funded by GA's balance sheet, our Ivy platform and co-investors. With this transaction, AUM will increase by $13 billion upon closing, and the transaction will be beneficial, both management fees as well as insurance operating earnings. And in June, KKR and GA together formed a strategic partnership with Japan Post Insurance. This partnership allows us to pursue additional growth opportunities through our collaboration with a key player in the Japanese insurance market. And as part of this, Japan Post committed meaningfully to Ivy II, which as Craig mentioned, held its final close in the quarter. Overall, GA is continue to demonstrate significant momentum with $144 billion of AUM as of Q2. This has doubled since we announced the acquisition in 2020, a further proof point of our acquisition and a demonstration of how the alignment we've created can drive real success. A specific area where GA has really helped accelerate the growth of one of our businesses is private credit. Today, we manage $78 billion in private credit with $45 billion of that in asset-based finance. We are a leader in the ABF space, encompassing both our high grade and higher yielding strategies. And with recent regional bank retrenchment, the already five plus trillion ABF addressable market has even more structural tailwinds for us, as those seeking capital look to KKR as a real solutions provider with scale. The multi-year relationship announced in the quarter with PayPal is just one recent example. And now turning to private wealth. We've touched on this topic a number of times given the market opportunity alongside the significant investments we have made in order to launch and distribute a number of new products. In Q2, we started fundraising for two new private wealth strategies focused on private equity and infrastructure. The launch of these products was a critical step in addressing the massive private wealth end market and introducing on a global scale products that traditionally have not been accessible to non-institutional clients. We're off to a really good start here. In total, including capital that has raised in Q2 and so far in Q3, we've raised $1.9 billion across these two strategies. While we are still in the very early days, these initial results are ahead of our expectations. We have also launched in just a handful of platforms so far, and we would expect that to increase over the coming quarters. In our credit business, we look forward to the launch of a new private BBC later this year. In addition to direct lending, the strategy incorporates a specific allocation to asset-based finance, which we think will be viewed as a real differentiator. So, at this point, we have a full suite of private wealth solutions strategically aligned with our four key investment verticals across the firm. Our focus here remains very much long-term oriented, ensuring that we are a real winner in the space over the next five to 10-plus years. Our conviction around success is high and is driven by a number of factors, including our brand, investment track record, our significantly expanded distribution and marketing teams, and our scale to be able to invest into the opportunity set. And importantly, each one of our core products across PE, infra, real estate and credit have aspects that are unique and a real testament to the innovation capabilities of our team. Now turning to building block number three. We continue to achieve substantial growth in our earnings power because of both an increase in our fee paying AUM and capital deployment. We currently have $10 billion of embedded gains that sit on our balance sheet. That's the fair value of our carry and investment portfolio relative to the underlying cost, that's up from $3.7 billion just a few years ago. This provides a real lens into our ability to create meaningful revenue outcomes in the future. And over the next few years, with continued investment performance and further capital deployment, that number is biased to increase, even as we expect to monetize more as the environment hopefully becomes more constructive. A reminder for how we think about earnings power. Distributable earnings is largely a cash metric. So, in times like these, when we sell less through the monetization environment, we are underearning that intrinsic earnings power and embedded gains are only one piece of that equation. Our expectation here is for continued scaling of our more recurring revenue businesses as well. Just looking at management fees alone, without raising another dollar, we currently have $38 billion of AUM with a weighted average management fee rate of almost a 100 basis points, that is not yet turned on. This capital once activated, would directly flow into management fees and be additive to earnings, but is not reflected today in our FRE or after tax DE. We also have $100 billion of dry powder, 96% of which is carry eligible. When we invest that capital, it creates the potential for more embedded gains and therefore revenue over time. These are the main reasons why we are so constructive around the potential for further significant and sustainable growth in our earnings per share over time. We have never been more confident around our model and our prospects, which is one of the reasons that you saw us buyback some stock in the quarter. Since the end of Q1, we have brought back or canceled approximately 6 million shares at an average price per share of less than $50 share. Repurchases have historically been and will continue to be an important driver of value creation for our shareholders. As a reminder, since we initiated our buyback program in 2015, we have bought back or canceled approximately 92 million shares at an average price per share of just over $27. This represents more than 10% of KKR shares outstanding today and almost 15% of our free float.  And with our recent acquisition such as KJRM, our Japanese REIT Manager and Global Atlantic, we have completed almost $5 billion of purchase price M&A with limited share issuance. We remain as a management team, the largest owners of stock, and are highly aligned with shareholders in our focus on equity value creation. So, to summarize, our earnings growth will continue to be supported by more stable forms of income, including our diversified high-quality and growing management fee business underpinned by our $200 billion of perpetual capital. Number two, we have several differentiated growth avenues, including insurance and private wealth amongst many others. And finally, our embedded gains and more broadly our earnings power is expected to continue to increase. These compounding pieces are why we continue to feel more confident than ever in our 2026 targets of $4-plus of FRE and $7-plus of after tax De per share. With that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. My focus is on the next fundraising cycle. When do you expect to have the first close for global infrastructure investors V? And do you believe this will be your first of the flagship fundraise?
Craig Larson: Hey, Craig. It's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question. I think as we look forward, we continue to see a really active amount of funds and strategies that we expect to be in the market with. We talked historically about having 30-plus strategies in the market over the coming 12 to 18 months. I think if anything, that number probably would've increased relative to what we would've talked about six or 12 -- three or six months ago. So, I think the level of activity and the number of strategies remains at a high level. We don't have any guidance or specificity as it relates specifically to our infrastructure strategy. But I think when you look at the back of the tables and you look at invested and committed capital relative to the size of the fund, I think fair to assume that that's something that is becoming a front of mind topic for us, but nothing to announce specifically as it relates to individual timings, let alone closings at this point.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Rob, I wanted to go back to some of the points you made at the end of your prepared remarks around the buyback and just capital management. Definitely nice to see a little bit of a pickup and repurchases here. Just curious that whether we are at a point now where you feel like the balance sheet has enough sort of scale to recycle capital for what you guys need. And the buybacks could become a bigger part of the story going forward where M&A aside, we could actually expect the total share count to start to decline in absolute terms. Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Great. Good morning Alex, and thanks a lot for the question. So, taking a step back just more broadly as it relates to capital allocation, the most important thing for us, and you've heard me say this and us as a management team say this before, most important thing is to have a consistent approach. And ours is one that I think is really maniacally focused on driving ROE and the highest per share earnings that we can with the lowest per unit of risk. And we talked about four strategic areas of deployment that we think can accomplish that. And so that's core private equity investing, continuing to invest across the insurance space. You mentioned strategic M&A. And the fourth one is share buybacks. And we think a real core competency of our management team is being able to move that marginal dollar of liquidity around to the highest return opportunity. And the thing that's going to drive the most earnings per share over time. And maybe the final point here is we're highly aligned in that decision-making process. As you know, KKR management owns close to 30% of KKR stock. And so, back to your specific question on share buybacks, as you mentioned, I noted on the prepared remarks, we've bought back over 90 million shares that represent almost 15% of our free float since we initiated our buyback program seven, eight years ago and just over $27 per share. So, we really like the body of work that's been accomplished over a long period of time.  And so, all to say share buybacks going to continue to be a very important part of our go-forward capital framework and capital allocation policy. But we're going to continue to look at other ways of driving growth in earnings per share over time as well, including in areas like core private equity insurance and M&A. Hope that's an helpful overview.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Alex, if you look at what we've been doing the last several years, as you know, we've deployed several billion dollars to M&A, that's been quite additive to our fee paying AUM, our FRE, our TDE. So, to Rob's point, we look at it holistically, look at the relative trade-offs. It's less about needing to invest in the business to start new strategies or seed new businesses. It's more about what's going to give us that highest marginal return on capital, as Rob mentioned.
Alexander Blostein: Got it. Okay. All makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. So, I'm curious to get a little more color on KPAC. I know it's early. I know it was on one platform in a short period of time in a slow PE backdrop, but you raised a couple hundred million. So, I'm curious what you learned from that one platform in that short period of time. Maybe the timing of the other platform ads. And then sidebar question, is this structure able to be included in 401 Ks if and when we get there? Thanks so much.
Craig Larson: Hey, Glen. It's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, I think -- let's take a step back for a moment, and I know that you all know all of this very well, but I think when we look at this opportunity, it's a real long-term secular opportunity that we had ahead -- that we have ahead of us. So, individual investors have not had an easy way to access the Alt space historically. I think that is certainly true as it relates to private equity most specifically. And so, if individual investors have 1% of their assets invested in Alts today, and that goes to 5% over the next several years, that's $8 trillion to $10 trillion of additional capital that has the potential to flow into alternative products.  And as it relates to a number of the points that Rob mentioned in terms of the strength of our brand, relationships that we have, the track record that we bring, all the investments we've made in terms of distribution, all of these things are super positive. And then you layer on top of that, the products creation and creativity that we think that we've brought to a number of these products. So, on our last earnings call, we'd noted that we had launched our PE vehicle as you'd indicated outside of the U.S. It closed on chest over, $400 million with distribution expected increase and infrastructure also soon to be accepting capital. And so, 90 days later, here we are with $1.9 billion raised across both PE and infrastructure, which is great. So, it's ahead of our expectations.  I think in terms of lessons learned, I guess I point to three. One, brand again is super important. I think, number two, again, I'd emphasize the product creation point, starting with KREST and as you then see that expansion. And then finally, I think that we have the ability to leverage the relationships that we've earned through KREST as we continue to expand into new distribution channels in private equity and infrastructure. So, hopefully that gives you a sense on that.
Robert Lewin: And Glen, just a quick follow up on the 401 K point, no plans in the immediate future as it relates to that. I do think it's worth noting though that KPAC is structured in a way that can be distributed through to the accredited investor and not just qualified purchasers. It's one of those points of innovation that I highlighted in our prepared remarks.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please receive your question.
Benjamin Budish: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the performance in the insurance business. It sounds like a lot of things kind of firing well over there. But just when we look at the reported ROE, which is still ahead of your target, it looks like the decline from Q4 to Q1 to Q2 was a bit steeper than we would've expected. So, just curious if there's any other color you can share there in terms of the kind of sequential growth in cost of insurance and G&A versus the investment income and how we should think about those various pieces going forward. Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. As you noted, GA continues to perform at a really high level, and in Q2 was ahead of our target returns for GA at a 15%-plus, pretax ROE. In terms of the operating earnings in the quarter and why you saw that quarter-on-quarter decline, that you referenced, really a function of a strategic decision at the GA level to position our book in more liquid securities at the beginning of Q2, more cash, more liquid fixed income. If you think back to early part of Q2, we were still in that regional bank crisis timeframe and I think we made the right decision to reposition the book at that point in time, gave up a little bit of ROE in the quarter, as you noted, but I think the right decision for the business.
Benjamin Budish: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks Rob.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, core private equity continues to be a great story, fair value now totals over $6 billion with about $3 billion in gains on the balance sheet, and it's generated a 20% return. It also looks like core private equity AUMs total of $34 billion today. So, could you talk about demand for this product specifically from third parties? And then, is there a way to think about the absolute level of third-party fundraising for the strategy over time?
Craig Larson: Hey, Brian. It's Craig. Why don't I start? First, thanks for all of the detail and noticing core PE again, it's one of the reasons we'd added that page in our press release focused on the asset class and the strategy. So, a lot of innovation in our firm happens when we can't find a home for great investments, and that's what happens with core private equity. It's a long duration strategy where we expect to hold investments in compound value for 10 to 15 years, but the risk reward is fundamentally different than our relative to our opportunistic PE funds. And so, at this point, we put together what we think is a really great portfolio of companies diversified across the world. As you noted, since inception returns have been very positive. That $34 billion of AUM was $12 billion three years ago. That's all organic growth. And I think, another point just as it relates to this in our model, because you're right, we've got the $6.2 billion of fair value relative to the $3 billion of cost. So with shareholders, we're participating in the economics, both in terms of the management fees and performance fees on the third-party piece, the compounding you see on the balance sheet. And then on top of that, we'd expect capital markets revenues to continue to grow alongside. Capital markets revenues in the quarter were between $25 million and $30 million. So, we've got a number of ways to win. I think from an LP standpoint, the types of LPs who find this asset class most interesting are those -- I think probably larger plans with longer dated liabilities and are interested in the matching aspect related to the asset class. So, I think that the opportunity for us to continue to grow both the third-party piece as well as on the balance sheet is one we're going to be talking about, have an opportunity to talk about for a long period of time.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It's Scott. Just a couple incremental thoughts for you. One is a younger part of the private equity asset class, so to some extent there is a bit of an education still happening. As you noted, we do have a significant amount of AUM. We have a lot of dry powder as we sit here today. But we've been out talking to investors around the world about why we like it so much and how aligned we are, and we're having some really good conversations. In addition to the larger plans that Craig referenced, and those may be focused on 10, 15, 20-year compounding, we're also seeing interest from large scale family offices that tend to think that like we do in terms of the power of long-term compounding, probably a greater appreciation for reinvestment risk. And as the portfolio continues to mature and we spend the dry powder, we have, we'll be back to market before too long. I'd be happy to share more color then.
Brian McKenna: Great. Thank you guys.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Brown: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask on the capital markets environment, clearly there's been some green shoots recently and just wanted to get your take on how that could translate into a broader recovery and just get your thoughts on maybe the next six to 12 months. And then, I know it's early in the quarter, but any quick color on the monetization out of quarter to date or expectations for the full quarter?
Robert Lewin: Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. If you look our capital markets business year-to-date, we've generated $250 million of revenue. And if you look back over the past four quarters, we've averaged $110 million to $115 million of revenue. And so, we're really proud of that performance and environment where the capital markets put that in equity we're largely shut for most of that period of time. So, I feel like we've built a business model that is quite durable in tough operating conditions. In terms of the back half of the year, you've noticed some green shoots and we've certainly seen some signs of life in the leverage finance market, a little bit in the IPO market, maybe the secondary market follows. I think it's a little early to call that we're out of it, but we do really think that we're positioned in an environment where the capital markets come back to generate really outsized outcomes. Hopefully that environment really persists and we can generate those types of outcomes for our shareholders in 2024 and beyond. Like I remind you that in 2021, our capital markets business in a really up market generated $850 million of revenue. So, I feel like we've built this model that protects in the downside, but really offers the opportunity for outsized -- outcomes when the markets are open. And I think we are doing much more as a firm today than we did in 2021. So, I think the opportunity is greater as we go forward here with that business.
Michael Brown: [Indiscernible]
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Thank you. And then, on your question on the monetization side, it's a bit of an odd quarter for us. We've got a couple of pretty meaningful monetizations that sit on the bubble between Q3 and Q4. So, instead of providing just a Q3 number in isolation, what I can let you know is that we have at least $350 million of visibility around monetization related revenue over the second half of the year. As usual, as we get to the end of this quarter, we'll provide that specific press release, which details our performance through the quarter. And so, what we're seeing a bit of an uptick here for sure. I think consistent with the overall tone and what we're all feeling is a bit more of a constructive environment. I'd still say that we're in the part of the cycle where we are underearning our intrinsic earnings power. So, hopefully more to come here, but a little bit of upside relative to where we've been.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It's Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color from me. And away from just the capital market specificity of your question, I just speak to overall firm activity. As Rob said, it's far too early to declare a return to normalcy, but there's no doubt that over the last several weeks, it feels like the markets are thawing a bit. The new deal pipeline and activity is up. Some monetization discussions are up. If that continues and if the public markets continue to perform, then we'd expect carry through to the fundraising environment over the next few quarters. But all that could reverse again with bad news. We've seen a couple headaches from this market, but overall there's no doubt that activity is up and the tone's improved. And it'll be interesting to see if this carries through post Labor Day.
Michael Brown: Great color. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please proceed your question.
Arnaud Giblat: Yeah. Good morning. I was just wondering -- wanting to come back on your development of your wealth strategies. I was wondering if you could focus in a bit more on the development of your retail strategy globally. Have you had any meaningful conversations with new distributors in Europe and in Asia? I'm just wanted -- wanting to get a bit more color there. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thanks for the question. I think, the answer is yes, distribution continues to expand. If you think of this as a funnel, I think from our standpoint, the funnel continues to grow at the very top end and that's global. So, as we talk about, for instance, private equity and infrastructure, those are vehicles where we specifically had created vehicles focused on individual markets in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., that opportunity again is, is one that's global and we're pursuing along those lines. So, nothing specific in terms of number of platforms today versus a year ago or anything along those lines. But I think the broader point again is just when we look at the opportunity we have ahead of us, trillions of opportunity of dollars that can move over into the Alts and we think we're really well-positioned to take a healthy piece of that.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Arnaud. It's Scott. I'm just a little bit color from my standpoint as Jim and I have been traveling around the world, we're definitely spending time with other distribution partners. As a reminder, 18 of our 23 offices at KKR are outside the United States. And maybe behind your question, we agree with the sentiment that this is not just a U.S. opportunity in private wealth. We very much look at it as a global one and have built teams in Europe and Asia and are developing partnerships in both places in addition to the U.S.
Arnaud Giblat: Great. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope you are doing well. The question beyond the deployment versus monetization backdrop. So, the monetizations were actually running a little bit more ahead of our forecast than the deployment has been the last couple quarters. And just wanted to get your sense of if we are in a better market environment, you say soft landing or no landing, does that create more monetization opportunities over the next few quarters relative to deployment, or are you still seeing the deployment backdrop as attractive here? And then maybe if you can comment on a couple areas within that, particularly like infrastructure, and then I guess even within credit.
Craig Larson: Hey, Brian. It's Craig. Why don't I start and then Rob will pick up as it relates to the monetization piece, I think specifically. So, a couple of observations. If you think, and let's start with private equity and real assets and then as you note we'll switch to credit, but I think over the last 18 months, a lot of the primary markets have effectively been shut. The IPO market's been pretty much shut over this period of time. The syndicated debt markets have been dislocated for the majority of that period, and capital has been quite precious. There's no question. Now those from a deployment standpoint, those are all things that are good for us. And so that's why I think on a number of these calls, you've heard us actually be quite constructive on risk reward. I think as it relates to private equity and real assets, we're value focused. We're looking for those opportunities where we can bring our operational resources to bear and where those can really move the needle. We love corporate carve outs. We've also been very active on pursuing public's private at this point. We've announced or closed on 14 take private transactions since the beginning of 2022. The most recent of those, you probably would've seen some articles this morning. So, I think that's been an area for us where we've been as active as anybody. I think as it relates to credit, and again, this is a big business for us. We've detailed in our press release, you see it on page 11, the composition of that overall amount of AUM $227 billion, of that we have $80 billion in private credit, really broken into those two pieces. Asset-based finance, real secular drivers as Rob had mentioned in his prepared remarks. And I think in direct lending, we remain very constructive on the risk reward, but you've seen overall transaction volumes be pretty modest within direct lending. So, I'd think of that asset class as one that has been taking a greater share, but of a smaller piece of the pie. But on overall risk reward, we remain very constructive on regular way direct lending at the same time.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. And I think you could separate a little bit deployment and monetization. As Craig went through, there's a lot going on in the deployment side, and we've done our best as a firm to really be focused on linear deployment of the dry powder in our strategies. Of course, when the capital markets are open, it makes deployment a little bit easier, but there is no doubt when the capital markets are open and the overall level of volatility comes down for some period of time that it's going to open up real drivers to be able to generate monetization related revenue. I mentioned on the call, we've got $10 billion on our balance sheet today of effective embedded gains between carried interest and our balance sheet investments. So, we're very well-positioned to be able to take advantage of the market opening. And again, we hope that some of the green shoots we've seen here persist post Labor day, and that presents some really good opportunities for us to deliver outsized outcomes in 2024 and beyond.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It’s Scott. I'd say -- I would expect both deployment and monetizations to increase if the capital markets open up. As a reminder, we've got $100 billion of dry powder, and so that's great news from a deployment standpoint. When markets are shut, it's harder to get deals done. We've been more active, especially recently, but there's no doubt if the capital markets open, there'll be more -- overall M&A activity, which will accrue to our benefit, and you'll also see more monetizations and that'll run across asset classes, including to your question infrastructure.
Brian Bedell: That's great. That's great color. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Finian O’Shea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Finian O’Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Another question on wealth. For the non-traded BDC you mentioned, are you going accredited only or does the feeder structure solve for that? And relatedly, what do you think that means for the potential for eventual monthly flows compared to what your peers are doing? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Finian. It’s Craig. Why don't I start? And again, I think the product creation part is an important component as it relates to this. So, across all four as it relates to real estate, private equity, infrastructure, as well as the private BDC. We're focused on having the opportunity to launch those vehicles and fundraise across both of those markets. So, the entire case suite is again allowing us to look to raise capital both through accredited investors and not just through qualified purchasers. And that's meaningful in our view. Like -- I think the accredited investor market is multiples the size of the qualified purchasers market. So, again, that pie or the top of that funnel is one that is in our view very broad and helps just increase that long-term opportunity that we see.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could spend a moment just on infrastructure, which is a real differentiator for KKR. So, just how are you thinking about driving the next leg of growth for infrastructure? What sort of steps might you take over the next couple years, and how are you expanding your capacity to deploy capital into infrastructure? And then just a housekeeping question for Rob, just on how much was invested and deployed off the balance sheet in the quarter?
Craig Larson: Hey, Mike. It's Craig. Why don't I start on infra? So, again, thank you for asking about. So two and a half years ago at our 21 Investor day, it was April of 21, we walked through infra as a case study for us is really how we look to build platforms over the long-term. And it begins with strong performance of the flagship strategy. And then that really is what allows you to earn the right to both scale those flagships and innovate into new adjacencies. And so today, our infrastructure platform is built out with four distinct segments. We have our global Infra Fund series, Asia Infra, diversified core, and then most recently, the infrastructure vehicles customized for private wealth investors. And so, to give you a sense of how that's grown, AUM at that Investor Day was $17 billion. At June 30, we were at $54 billion, so that's $17 billion to $54 billion. All organic. The growth in innovation hasn't stopped. Again, I think we're in the earliest of days as it relates to infrastructure and private wealth. It's an asset class that we think lends itself very nicely in this marketplace. And look, the renewables space is an area where we also think we can do more. So more to come here over time. And as it relates to deployment, logically, as you've seen the increase in our footprint, you've seen the step function increase in overall deployment stats for us. So, infra deployment in 2019 was a little over two -- was a little over $2 billion. It was $2.1 billion. 2020 is $2.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $12 billion in the asset class. So -- and again, as you would've seen in -- as Robert touched on capital markets, there are flow through opportunities for us at the same point in time. So more to come, but it continues to feel like we're wonderfully well positioned.
Robert Lewin: And then, Mike, very quickly, your second part of your question, in the quarter we deployed approximately $850 million off the balance sheet. A good chunk of that -- most of it is a core private equity. And then our realizations were a little under $250 million on the quarter.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Rufus Hone: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe if you could spend a minute giving an update on your Asia business. You've now owned the KJRM business for a little over a year. It'd be great to hear more about how that acquisition's performing and whether you see any more opportunities to consolidate your position in the region inorganically, and also what the near-term outlook is for fundraising. Thanks very much.
Robert Lewin: Great. Rufus, thanks a lot for the question. Asia remains a core part of our growth story at KKR, and we've talked about this in the past for a number of reasons. We feel really good that our Asia business one day will be as big as our U.S. business. So, we've got a great competitive position in the marketplace, plus private equity and infrastructure, both of which are the largest in the region in terms of fund sizes. We've got real growing businesses across real estate, as well as credit as well. In terms of the KJRM acquisition, that's off to a great start. And from a strategic standpoint, really doing what we wanted it to accomplish, which is to generate very consistent returns for their existing investor base, which translates into a very predictable management fees for us at KKR. But much more importantly, in terms of what it does for the rest of our opportunistic strategy and core plus strategy in the Japan market, just markedly changed our approach to what we're able to do in Japan. And really in terms of one of our big growth engines within Asia is the Japanese market. And our competitive position there is in particular really strong and KJRM really helps cement that.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Rufus. It's Scott. I'd say to your question on would we do more M&A in the region and consolidate in that way. We'd be open to it. We're always looking. So, definitely open-minded.  The only other thing I would add is Global Atlantic is also now growing with partnerships in Asia. Something that we've been able to do now that we're together. We announced Block with AXA in Hong Kong. We, of course, announced the Japan Post Partnership this past quarter. We've announced some flow partnerships in Singapore is just one more example. And there's other discussions along those lines. Some are between organic and inorganic, but we do see opportunities to expand our insurance efforts in Asia as well.
Rufus Hone: Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next questions from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Blostein: Hi. Thank you guys for taking the follow-up. Appreciate it. I wanted to touch on your credit business, specifically asset-backed finance. It's a place where you spend a little bit more time just communicating to the street of sort of how big it's gotten over the years, and you've got a number of origination platforms that are supporting it. So, as you think about raising capital for those type of strategies outside of Global Atlantic, so whether it's third-party insurance companies or maybe other institution LPs, what does that look like over the next couple of years? And maybe just remind us what the fee rates are? I'm assuming it's a -- generally a lower fee rate, like separate account type of business, but curious to get more. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Why don't I start, Alex? So, first glad that you asked about, again, back to the detail we provided on page 11. So, we've got $227 billion of AUM in credit and liquid strategies. A key component of that is the $80 billion in private credit. Two big pieces here, the $45 billion in asset-based finance alongside of the $33 billion of direct lending. These are big businesses for us. And so, back to your question, ABF is a massive end market, $5-plus trillion. You have high barriers to entry in our view -- a lack of scale capital against this end market. And we have, and we continue to see it, many traditional providers leaving the market and in our view creating a void. And so, we're finding attractive risk reward, would say that's true in terms of the high grade ABF strategy, which to date has been led really in partnership with everything that Global Atlantic has doing. And that's been increase opportunities for us to continue to be more relevant to the broad insurance landscape, as well as within our traditional asset-based finance strategy where we have funds and separately managed accounts focused on a mid-teens gross IRR opportunity. Those would be the strategies for instance that had pursued the PayPal transaction.  And so, deployment has been healthy. I think over the trailing 12 months, it's been about $11 million for us. So, it's been a place where we've been active. And in addition to the PayPal partnership that we announced in June, the team does continue to be active on the regional front. I think our most recent portfolio acquisition here close about two weeks ago. And in terms of fee rates, we haven't really gone into detail in terms of the separation between the high grade and the asset-based finance strategy. But fair to say that commensurate with that risk return that you're correct. The high grade would be a different area as it relates to blended fee rate relative to the asset-based finance fund itself.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. Alex, it’s Scott. Just maybe a little bit more color on the types of capital raising. This is going to be a bunch of different formats, so you're not going to see a large flagship fund would be my guess. But we do have an ABF fund. We have our BDCs. We have leveraged separate accounts. We have unleveraged separate accounts. We have a high grade ABF strategy, which also tends to be in separate account format, and there's other things that we're working on. So, it all aggregates up to the $45 billion or so that Craig mentioned. I say you're right, the initial interest over the last several years has been from a number of different places. But if there's a thematic to it, if insurance, we now manage roughly $200 billion for insurance companies, 140, 150, give or take from GA, the rest from third parties. And we have 150 insurance companies that invest with us on a third-party basis. But also increasingly we're seeing interest from institutions. This asset class reminds me a little bit of infrastructure 10-plus years ago. There's a lot of education. In the early days, growing market, not a lot of people understood what it was. We are finding that there's increased interest in it as the focus on private credit has continued to broaden and go global. So, we're optimistic.
Alexander Blostein: Perfect. Thanks for all that.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
End of Q&A:
Craig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help and thank you everybody for your continued interest in KKR. Please feel free, of course, to follow up with me or the IR team post this call. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking to everybody in 90 days or so. Thank you so much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-08 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. As usual, for the call, I'm joined by Scott Nuttall, our co-Chief Executive Officer; and Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. This quarter, fee-related earnings per share came in at $0.62, and after-tax distributable earnings came in at $0.81 per share. I'm going to begin the call by walking through the details for the quarter before turning things over to Rob. So, beginning with management fees. Management fee growth continues to be a real bright spot for us. In Q1, management fees were $738 million. That's up 18% year-over-year, and looking over the last 12 months, management fees are up 23%. Looking a little deeper, over the last 12 months, management fees in private equity and credit both increased 18%, while in real assets, management fees are up 40%. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $142 million for the quarter, $102 million of which came from our Capital Markets business. Our fee-related compensation margin was at the midpoint for the quarter at 22.5% and other operating expenses were $150 million. So, putting that together, fee-related earnings were $549 million for the quarter or $0.62 per share, which I mentioned a moment ago, and that's with an FRE margin of 61%. This is now the 10th consecutive quarter where you've seen our FRE margin at or above that 60% level. Walking further down the income statement. Realized performance income totaled $175 million, driven by our traditional and core private equity businesses, and realized investment income was $198 million for the quarter, driven by activity in growth equity. Both realized performance and investment income compensation margins were at their midpoints for the quarter. Our asset management operating earnings were $778 million, and our insurance segment generated $205 million of pretax operating earnings, which I'll spend another minute on shortly. So in aggregate, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $719 million or $0.81 per share. Now turning to investment performance. The traditional private equity business was up 2% for the quarter, and over the last 12 months, was down 9%. Importantly here, inception-to-date IRRs for our blended flagship funds, so Americas XII, Europe V and Asia IV remained strong at 22%, which is meaningfully ahead of the corresponding 7% figure for the MSCI World. In real assets, the real estate portfolio was down 3% in Q1. While we are all seeing a difficult market for a handful of areas within real estate, our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted towards those assets and themes where you're seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth. So, think industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing and storage. However, as cap rates increased in the quarter, that more than offset NOI growth, leading to the modest decline in the portfolio for the quarter. Infrastructure was up 7% in the quarter. This performance reflects the strength of our infrastructure portfolio on a global basis. And with higher interest rates, we've strategically leaned into more inflation-protected assets. On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 4% in the quarter, outperforming its index, while the alternative credit portfolio was up 2%. And for the balance sheet, investment performance was flat in Q1. Now, in addition, we have two new updates that can be seen through the earnings release. First, I briefly mentioned our insurance results this quarter. Turning back to this topic, we expect you saw the recast financials we posted last week on our website and also filed through an 8-K. These changes reflected two things. First, per FASB guidance and as required for all SEC filers, we implemented the accounting principles of LDTI within KKR's insurance segment to reflect the new accounting standards for long-duration contracts such as life insurance and annuities. Overall, the impact here on our segment financials are quite modest. There was a $1 million positive impact to 2021 pretax insurance segment operating earnings and a $74 million positive impact to 2022 pretax insurance segment operating earnings. And in terms of 12/31 book value, there is an increase of $480 million. And second, to conform to other alternative asset management companies and enhance comparability, we're reporting our insurance segment operating earnings on a pretax, not an after-tax basis. So, as you look at Page 3 of the earnings release, income taxes attributable to KKR's asset management and our insurance segment are now captured within that single line item titled Income Taxes on operating earnings. The 8-K referenced a moment ago recast our financials reflecting all of these changes for 2021 as well as on a quarterly basis for 2022 to help everyone look at our results on a comparable basis. And the second change within our press release you'll see on page 25. We’ve included additional disclosure on our core private equity strategy. With $34 billion of AUM, we believe we have the largest core PE asset management business in the world. And core PE remains the largest allocation we have on our balance sheet, so we thought the additional disclosure and context would be helpful for investors this quarter as well as in quarters to come. As a reminder, this is a long-duration investment strategy for us where we expect to hold investments for 10- to 15-plus years and believe these investments carry a more modest risk return profile compared to traditional PE. And as you can see on the page, our core PE balance sheet investments have increased steadily from $1.4 billion in 2018 to over $5.7 billion of fair value today. The $5.7 billion of fair value compares to the $2.7 billion of costs or 2.1 multiple of cost currently, a strong return over approximately five years. In total, core comprises approximately 32% of total balance sheet investments and consists of 19 companies across multiple industries and geographies. And with a little over 20% of total PE capital invested in the last 12 months into core PE, we remain very active in the space. And one final note. Consistent with historical practice, we increased our dividend to $0.165 per share per quarter or $0.66 on an annualized basis. This is now the fourth consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. The past few months have certainly continued to be dynamic on the macro front. However, different backdrops do create opportunities, especially for firms like ours that have substantial locked-up capital, a significant amount of dry powder and a global and highly coordinated investment team with expertise that spans multiple different asset classes. I thought it would be helpful this morning to go through what we are experiencing day-to-day across the firm. Let's start with fundraising. We raised $12 billion of capital in the quarter. In private equity, activity this quarter included the final close on European Fund VI at $8 billion, which is approximately 20% larger than its predecessor. It's a really great outcome in what is the most challenged part of the fundraising market and now gives us $40 billion of committed capital in total, looking at our active traditional PE funds across Asia, North America and Europe. We believe this is the largest active capital base for traditional private equity by a wide margin. In credit and liquid strategies, we raised almost $9 billion in Q1, which is just about what we raised on average per quarter in 2022. In total, though, the $12 billion of new capital raised is a little bit on the lighter side for us. Scott is going to follow up with a little more color on the fundraising environment in a few minutes. Now against this backdrop, we still do feel incredibly fortunate for a few reasons. First, since 2020, we've raised approximately $60 billion of capital for our traditional private equity and core private equity franchises. Given all the flagships raised over this period, 2023 was never going to be an outsized fundraising year for us. So, our focus in private equity is on investing the capital that we have previously raised. And we have almost as dry powder as we've ever had as a firm to invest into the dislocated environment. Now, to be clear, we are still in the market fundraising for 30-plus strategies, largely in real assets and credit over the next 12 to 18 months, and our fundraising teams remain highly engaged with our clients. Second, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities. As an example, we've talked to private wealth and democratized products several times on these calls. And we are pleased that since our last earnings call, our democratized private equity vehicle outside the U.S. raised over $400 million on just one platform at its first close, which will show up in our Q2 results. It's a great start for us, and we hope to build on this momentum with the wire houses as the domestic vehicle comes on line in the second half of the year. And in terms of our democratized infrastructure strategy, our U.S. vehicle is expecting a first close over the summer, while its international counterpart is right on its heels with a first close expected soon thereafter. We are really excited about both of these strategies. And while we're in the earlier days, we're pleased with initial reception and enthusiasm. The launch of these products is a critical step in addressing the huge private wealth end market and bringing products that traditionally have largely not been accessible to non-institutional clients on a global scale. And third, on the insurance front, momentum really does continue at Global Atlantic. AUM at GA has almost doubled since we announced the acquisition in July 2020 from $72 billion to $142 billion today. And since the transaction closed in early 2021, our share of book value has increased from $2.9 billion to $4.4 billion. In terms of Q1, financial performance continued to run ahead of our expectations and capital raising remains robust. While GA did not announce any block transactions in Q1, our pipeline here of compelling opportunities remains quite strong, and we would expect greater activity over time. Turning now to deployment. We have $106 billion of dry powder, which is close to a record figure for us and feel really excited about the investing environment that we are currently in, so we remain incredibly well positioned to build the portfolio for the future. And looking what our teams have done more recently, we continue to be pretty creative of putting that capital to work. In European Private Equity, we announced the acquisition of FGS Global, a leading strategic communications advisory firm. This is the latest example of the team's focus on proprietary opportunities where we can provide long-term capital and a global network of resources to help an entrepreneurial, world-class management team that we've known and worked with for over a decade. In infrastructure, we closed on the acquisition of Vantage Towers in partnership with Vodafone. Vantage is our latest take-private transaction. We have announced or closed on 10 take-privates since the beginning of 2022. An investment largely from our diversified core Infra Fund, Vantage is the second largest telecom tower company in Europe. And in our credit business, we are very constructive on the risk reward we're seeing today in the market. As the syndicated loan markets have remained choppy, new issue volumes are down over 50% year-to-date. Companies looking for debt capital continue to increasingly look to the private credit markets where base rates are up, spreads are wider and lender protections are more significant. We believe that we are in the best direct lending environment that we have seen for the past 10-plus years. Now with interesting deployment, which largely comes from higher volatility does come a more challenged monetization environment. The environment here continues to be quiet and our expectation is that it will remain soft for much of 2023. However, as we've discussed in prior calls, our business model has multiple advantages. And one of them is that 90-plus percent of our capital is locked up for the long term or is perpetual in nature. So, we are not core sellers, and we won't look to aggressively monetize our portfolio unless it's into a window that maximizes outcomes for our investors. Even with the volatility and markdowns we have appropriately taken over the last 12 to 15 months, we maintain over $9 billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet. So, if we never made another investment and created no additional value or returns, we are positioned to generate $9-plus billion of monetization-related revenue. The key message you're hearing from us today is that we remain highly confident in our portfolio, and we'll optimize the monetization outcome when it is most advantageous to our investors. So to summarize, while the past several months have presented a more challenging operating environment, it has not changed our long-term outlook. We continue to have more conviction in our ability to meet our goals: FRE of $4-plus per share and after-tax DE of $7-plus per share by 2026 than we did when we first issued that guidance in late 2021. In our teaching materials posted at the beginning of this year, we introduced six very significant drivers of value creation for KKR. These areas, real assets, Asia Pacific, core private equity, private wealth, insurance as well as the opportunities afforded to us through our balance sheet continue to position us for substantial growth, and that is why we have the confidence that we do in our long-term fundamentals. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. I thought today, I'd talk about what we're seeing near term and how we're feeling longer term. Near term, the market volatility is doing three things: it's causing some institutional asset allocators to be more cautious and delay decisions; it's making us want to sell less of our portfolio; and it's creating some very attractive investment opportunities for us. On the fundraising front, we are seeing some investors pause as they get their bearings. This is, in particular, true in some U.S. and European institutions. It has not been the case in other areas. Until this changes, it will likely slow down capital formation in the near term for some of our efforts. We don't expect this to have a big impact on the firm for a couple of reasons. First, as Rob noted, we are not in the market with our flagship PE funds this year. We expect those to come back to market in 2024 and 2025. Frankly, we're fortunate with that timing. We have been actively raising capital, however, for our non-private equity businesses. To put some numbers to this, new capital raised over the last 12 months totaled $67 billion. $63 billion or 95% of that number was raised in strategies outside of traditional private equity funds. Given the growth in scaling across our credit and real asset platforms, we are meaningfully more diversified across strategies than someone less familiar with KKR would likely expect. Second, we are seeing the benefit of increased diversification across our distribution channels and are less reliant on any 1 type of investor than we used to be. As background, a handful of years ago, we sold almost exclusively to institutions. Today, we sell to institutions, insurance and private wealth. Taking those in turn, while some institutions are pulling back or delaying a bit, others like sovereign wealth funds are not, and we are having a number of productive dialogues globally, in particular around private credit and real assets. Our insurance efforts are also scaling meaningfully. You heard the $142 billion number from Global Atlantic. If you include the $56 billion we have from third-party insurers, we now manage nearly $200 billion for insurance companies globally. That number is up nearly 50% from two years ago. Also, as Rob referenced, we are now live with our democratized PE and infrastructure strategies. Our democratized real estate product has been raising capital since mid-2021 and is adding more platforms. And we have another private credit vehicle for the wealth channel in the pipeline for later this year. So, we will have all four of our major asset classes in democratized format available globally and being added to multiple new platforms over the course of the next several quarters. Candidly, we don't yet know what all this will yield. But we do know it will be upside for us relative to what we've been doing to date. And we know that the private wealth opportunity is significant for the firm. So, we are diversifying KKR not just in how we invest but in how we access capital. And we see all this lining up really well for us over the next couple of years as we expect to be back in the market with our flagship funds at a more hospitable time, which will coincide with us continuing to scale our insurance efforts, which are proving countercyclical and benefiting from a higher rate environment, at which point, we will also be more mature in private wealth with our products on multiple platforms in multiple geographies, all while our recently expanded sales force, up from 100 to 280 people in the last couple of years, is hitting their stride. So, despite the near-term fundraising environment, we feel good about the progress we're making and now have multiple ways to win with more momentum coming. So, that all bodes well. On the monetization front, we will likely sell less in an environment like this, but we are seeing the value of the portfolio continue to grow so this is really just a timing question. And on the investing front, the great news is times like these tend to generate some of our best investments. We expect the next couple of years to be strong vintage years for returns across asset classes. So we expect our earnings down the road to be higher as we monetize the investments we're making in this environment. Putting this all together, while the near term may feel harder to interpret and the next couple of quarters may stay bumpy in markets, we actually feel great about how we are building the firm and executing our plan. Now, switching to the longer term. Last quarter, I referenced the market volatility and suggested it's important to separate the signal from the noise and that we remain focused on what we can control. That continues to be the case. The market noise has not changed our bottom line. We feel even more convicted in hitting the FRE and after-tax DE targets we shared with you. Let me explain why. In January, we shared how the earnings power of the firm has evolved. We are in a fundamentally different place than we were even a few years ago. Because we report DE largely on a cash basis, there will be times we are over-earning that earnings power and times we are under-earning. In times like this, when we are selling less, we are under-earning. But we look at how that earnings power is trending and our progress has been significant. Our ability to create forward-looking financial outcomes is well ahead of where we were just a few years ago. The capital we're raising is increasing the amount of dry powder we have, already a near record $106 billion. And we have a lot of management fee growth visibility with $37 billion of committed capital where fees turn on when the capital is invested. Our carry-bearing invested capital, up 3 times over the last five or so years, is continuing to scale with a great investing environment in front of us as we deploy our dry powder. And our embedded gains continue to increase, from $2 billion to $9 billion over the last three years. Putting all this together and stepping back, our run rate earnings power has doubled over the last three years at KKR. That's a metric we think matters, especially when the noise is loud. So, thank you for taking the time to understand our business. And hopefully, it's clear why we are so optimistic about the path and growth ahead. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs
Alex Blostein Sachs: Maybe we could start with some of the dynamics you're seeing in private credit. And specifically, I was hoping we can zone in on direct lending. So, Scott, you suggested that's an area where you continue to see opportunities and the environment remains, obviously, quite interesting there. Can you help maybe unpack like sort of the sizing of that business for you guys outside of the BDC? And ultimately, how much of third-party capital outside of GA you have in there and the opportunity to really scale that where you could bring in third-party assets into the franchise? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Sounds good. Thanks for the question, Alex. Craig, why don't you kick off and then I'll jump on?
Craig Larson: Yes, sure. So look, I think in terms of the industry, just to start there, Alex, and some of the dynamics we're seeing, I think mid-market private equity firms which really are a lot of the driver of the deployment you see here do have a lot of dry powder. And so you're seeing more of these firms, more mid-market borrowers generally who want to use the private debt markets. So we expect the private debt markets broadly in direct lending specifically to continue to grow and take share. And I think in terms of KKR, you should expect to see us grow here in a number of ways. First, in a traditional institutional format. So we're fundraising for our U.S. and European direct lending strategy. Second, we have our BDC, as you mentioned. And we think there'll be opportunities over time to introduce additional vehicles focused on the private wealth opportunity. And finally, Global Atlantic is also active here. So I think in summary, direct lending, it's a core part of our credit business, lots of ways for us to grow. We think that can be in the institutional private wealth, insurance businesses across multiple forms of capital, traditional funds, separately managed accounts, perpetual capital, and that's both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So again, the backdrop for us just feels really constructive with lots of opportunities going out.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Just a couple of thoughts I'd add, Alex. First off, if you think about our overall private credit and our corporate credit business, it's roughly $75 billion or so of assets. If you include real estate credit, which is a very large business for us, that adds another roughly $30 billion to $35 billion. So, we're $110 billion, give or take of total between the two. And that is, to your question, really fed across a number of different vehicles, we've got Global Atlantic, we've got our BDC and other permanent vehicles, we have funds, we have separate accounts and we're raising capital across all of those. And we continue to see, to Craig's point, a real opportunity to continue to scale those businesses, especially in this environment where the traditional banks are pulling back. But I would highlight a few things. Direct lending gets a lot of attention. The senior secured opportunity is definitely there. Spreads are wider, protections are greater. We think this is going to be a great vintage period, and we're finding real interest from investors around the world in that seniority plus yield off a higher base rate. So, we think that interest will continue. The other thing that doesn't get as much attention is our asset-based finance business, which is also a very large opportunity for us, a very large business. That is roughly a $4 trillion to $5 trillion end market in terms of opportunity, on its way to $7 trillion. This is -- think of it as a series of different hard assets and consumer assets that the banks use to finance that they're pulling back from. We have a number of platforms that we've created to go after that space, again accessed across all different types of vehicles I mentioned. And then real estate -- real estate credit, you can imagine what that market looks like over the next several years, it's going to be a big opportunity for us to scale there as well, and we're already one of the largest players. So big opportunity for growth as we think about how do we double our $200 billion-plus in credit globally again from here.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: You mentioned holding on to some things longer and pausing realizations, and last week, a competitor gave a pretty big guide down on PE realization expectations for the year, basically saying they didn't expect a big uptick until 2024. So, do you agree with this view? And I guess, more specifically looking at your pipeline and conversations, still think there's a path to posting meaningful pickup in the second half? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Patrick, thanks for the question. I think -- and I provided this in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a pretty quiet monetization outlook out there right now. That's what we're seeing in our current pipeline. And our expectation is probably going to remain that way for the duration of the year. Now I think there's a few separate points to hit on here for KKR specifically. I think the most important point, and I mentioned this earlier, is that 90-plus percent of our capital at KKR is either perpetual or locked up for eight-plus years from inception. In terms of our carry-eligible AUM, I'd bet that number is probably closer to 100%. And so, we are generally not forced sellers into the marketplace. Number two, while the near term here could be pretty slow, there are a number of factors that really contribute to our confidence in being able to generate very meaningful step-ups in monetization-related revenue in the future when the environment improves. Number one, it's the health of our existing portfolio. It's really strong. I don't think that we can overstate that point enough. We feel really good that we got the macro right coming into this period of time, and we'll exit it in a stronger position competitively as a result. Number two is really the scaling and diversification of our capital deployment over the last 5 years that's going to generate the carry and balance sheet gains in the future. Scott hit on this in his prepared remarks, but our carry-eligible AUM is up 3 times versus the last vintage, which is generating today's carry. And number three, it's our dry powder, $106 billion, almost a record number for us, and 95-plus-percent of that $106 billion is carry-eligible. And so really the question here around the trade-offs between monetizing investments today versus in the future was one of the key reasons why we included that earnings power framework that we did in our teaching materials from January. It's that metric, I think, that really speaks to the go-forward opportunity for us and why we remain so constructive on the longer-term ability to generate real monetization outcomes and ultimately $7-plus per share of TDE by 2026.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Patrick, a couple of things. One, this is obviously going to be heavily market-dependent. I think Rob hit on it. We've gone from $2 billion to $9 billion of unrealized gains in the last three years. So that's the number that we track. That's why we shared that with this. So, this is just a matter of when do we choose that we want to monetize some of those gains on the margin, especially in U.S. and Europe. We're probably going to choose to wait. But keep in mind, one of the things we benefit from is a more global portfolio than most. Asia, in particular, has some different market dynamics going on right now. I think that will help on the margin. But the bigger picture message you should take is the $4-plus of FRE that we shared and the $7-plus of TDE per share a few years out, we still feel great about that. So I wouldn't get too worried about what we say in the next couple of quarters. I'd focus more on that earnings power and where do we expect to end up. My personal perspective is I would expect those numbers will go up relative to down based on what we're going through now.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.
Brian McKenna: So I had a question on your infrastructure business. Fund IV has about $10 billion of uncalled commitments. So how should we think about the quarterly pace of deployment here for the remainder of the year? And then do you have any initial expectations around the size and timing of Fund V?
Craig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? First, on deployment, one of the things that is interesting and you've picked up on this is the real scaling you've seen over time in deployment. So in 2019, infra deployment was $2.1 billion. In 2020, it was $2.2 billion. And over the trailing 12 months, we've invested $14 billion across the infrastructure platform. Activity is very high. This remains among the busiest teams and the framework of our firm and it's global. And returns, again, as you would have seen the snapshot from page 7, have continued to be, we think, strong and differentiated. So I think the activity level continues to be high. We haven't announced anything as it relates to timing of future fundraising, et cetera. But I think if we continue to execute the way that we have, there'll be continued opportunities for us. And then 1 other point here is, again, innovation is not -- is going to continue in the framework of the firm. And I think you're seeing that real time in terms of what we talked about in the prepared remarks on democratized infrastructure as an avenue that also will continue to help us both from a deployment and honestly from a fundraising standpoint as well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Brown with KBW.
Mike Brown: So in the quarter, concerns related to the fixed annuity surrenders really picked up in March as the liquidity stress really led the market. In GA, what did you guys see in terms of the fixed annuity surrenders in the quarter and what have you seen thus far in the second quarter? And then if you just take the other side, what are you guys seeing on the organic growth side? How has that performance been in the first quarter, specifically towards the tail end and then into the second quarter?
Rob Lewin: Yes, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Punchline is no surprises as it relates to surrenders. They remain in line with management's expectation on initial underwriting. So we feel good about that. That has continued into the second quarter as well into April. As it relates to the opportunity from here, clearly, the opportunity, we think, on the retail side of the business, given where interest rates are and where annuity is price -- annuities are priced today remains a really robust 1 that our team is very focused on. We have a very strong market share there. And I mentioned this earlier through the prepared remarks, but the institutional side of our business has a real healthy pipeline right now. And so be a little bit lumpier in nature but we feel good with what we're seeing there and some of the risk reward that exists in that part of the market as well.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Maybe just on capital deployment. How are you thinking about the pace? And I guess in the context of monetization slowing down, clearly, the market is slower and you don't want to be monetizing in this environment. And heard you loud and clear, you're eager, of course, to deploy in this environment with valuations being good. But to what extent will any kind of slowdown in the market will prevent you from doing that? And how important can your own internal capital markets business be in sort of narrowing that gap versus, say, using other means of deploying capital? And then if I could just weave in, just the $37 billion of committed capital that comes into fee-paying AUM, just your expectations of timing on that.
Craig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start and then Rob can pick up on the $37 billion number? So just a couple of observations, I guess, in terms of deployment. Look, first, over the last 18 months, we've seen a lot of dislocation and valuations have come down pretty meaningfully. And a lot of the primary markets have either been shut, thinking of the IPO market or the syndicated debt markets, again, as an example, which aren't fully healed. So capital at the moment is precious, but all of those things from a deployment standpoint, we look at, I think, are very good things for us. And as Rob pointed out in our prepared remarks, with our fundraising success heading into this period, we're really well positioned when you put those 2 things together. Now I think in this backdrop, look, we're going to be value focused. We're going to look for those opportunities where our operational resources and focus can really move the needle. We love corporate carve-outs. We've been active in pursuing public to private, so I think that's an example of where you're seeing probably as much activity from us as anybody within the industry. And so we're going to continue to be opportunistic across that -- across those parts of the opportunity set. And I think finally, the other thing you're seeing because it's interesting is the balance you're seeing across the firm. Real diversification, real balance. Over the trailing 12 months, traditional private equity deployment was $11 billion. Real estate was $10 billion and infrastructure, again, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $14 billion. So you're seeing a real balance in that level of investment activity. And I think it's also just worth highlighting and it's kind of related to the first, but the growth you've seen also in terms of real asset deployment with the growth in our infrastructure and real estate platforms, you've seen a big step-up in overall deployment, and that is also true within the credit business. So in 2019, deployment in credit was $10 billion, 2020 was $10.3 billion, trailing 12 months, it was $17 billion. And then I think as it relates to capital markets, you're bringing up a very fair point just as it relates to the strength of the team and what having 70 people can do for us as we're trying to put capital structures together and look to finance those deployment opportunities. And to date, despite all of the disruption, we've not had a situation where we haven't been able to finance an opportunity that we wanted to pursue. And I think the strength of the team and the breadth that we have in terms of the global capital markets franchise has a critical part in that.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Brian, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add. One, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think it's going to be a great couple of vintage years we're walking into here. So if you first start with equity, which is probably the focus of your question, there's a couple of things that go on. Buyers and sellers need to find common ground. It usually takes about 12 months for that to happen as the markets adjust. We seem to be countering that. We're starting to work to the other side of that. Obviously, the bank failure has created a little bit of a pause in some discussions, but we are pretty active on a number of different fronts. So we think that will not be something that holds us up for much longer. I think the financing markets, to Craig's good point, capital markets and to your question, has been a secret weapon for us and has allowed us to get some deals done. We've done a couple of deals where we've spoken for 100% equity and then the private credit market shows up and put the financing in place. So we're not letting the financing markets hold us back in TE or in infrastructure. In fact, it's kind of creating some opportunities where maybe it's tougher for our competition that don't have the same capability sets and the same capital markets team. And then as I mentioned before, on the credit side, it's just more flow and more opportunity across both corporate and real estate credit for us.
Rob Lewin: And Brian, just a quick follow-up on the $37 billion of capital, no firm guidance there, but our -- a decent rule of thumb would be 3 to 4 years until that shows up in fee-paying AUM. As a reminder, that capital comes in at close to 100 basis points on a weighted average fee basis.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: As you guys have continued to grow out your insurance relationships, can you talk about how you have expanded your investment capabilities there, where you see room to further scale some of those capabilities maybe in real estate credit? And maybe you could talk about some of the initiatives there. And then what white space opportunities remain at this point where you could broaden out the investment capability set there?
Scott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. Really good question. I would say there's no doubt that broadening our insurance relationships, both with Global Atlantic and with third parties, has allowed us to meaningfully scale some parts of the firm. In particular, I would say, all things private credit, direct lending, asset-based finance that I mentioned before, maybe part of the firm that had the biggest impact was across real estate credit. I think the year before, we did the Global Atlantic transaction, a real estate credit team originated something like $2 billion of loans, and the first year after, it was somewhere in like $12 billion or $13 billion. So it's allowed us to meaningfully scale our presence, both from an origination standpoint and also allow us, I think, to do an even better job for the third-party insurers because now we are operating just like them through the regulatory environment that they're living with as an operator as opposed to just an agent. And I think there's opportunities to grow in all of those spaces. These are very large end markets. As you know, our strategy and everything we do is only be in businesses where we are or can get to top 3 in that space, and we feel great across all of those fronts. It also gives us an opportunity to look more globally as we're looking at, in particular, for Global Atlantic blocks across Asia or Europe and adding insurance clients outside the U.S., I'd say our client base is heavier in the U.S. today, but we are building relationships outside the U.S. as well. And that gives us an opportunity to expand, just like we did in the U.S., our origination footprint across all those areas, we can do it outside the U.S., too. And we're starting to do that now across both Europe and Asia across those asset classes. So it's been a big positive for us on a number of different fronts, and it kind of bolted us to top 3 across a number of those different businesses much faster. In terms of kind of white space, to the second part of your question, more broadly, I think there are a number of different things that we could point to. The biggest impact on the firm, however, is just going to be scaling everything that we started. We see an opportunity to double and triple several of the businesses that we're in. As you know, a lot of the businesses we've started in the last -- started in the last handful of years. Over 50% of the firm is not yet scaled in our definition. Over 50% of the money we raised last year is in strategies less than 5 years old. So the biggest impact is going to be scaling what we started. But there are some other areas. I'd point to energy transition and climate is something that we could point to. I'd point of life sciences as another big area that over time could be meaningful for us in terms of coming attractions.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And if I could just sneak in a housekeeping question for Rob, just on the investment deployment off the balance sheet.
Scott Nuttall: We would have been disappointed if you didn't ask that one, Michael. You're very consistent.
Rob Lewin: Mike, we were at $500 million of deployment in the quarter and realization is about $150 million.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arnaud Giblat with BNP Paribas.
Arnaud Giblat: I'd like to follow up on the deployment in credit. It's been detected by yourself and most of your peers as a significant opportunity to take market share from the banks. Yet when we look at Q1 data here, the promise in credit is quite soft. I was just wondering if you -- what sort of dynamics to work out for us to see really deploy and pick up here?
Craig Larson: Yes, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, I think it's -- the first quarter, as I think we'll all remember, March, in particular, was a really disruptive period. We've had 2 bank failures since the beginning of March. Just a tremendous amount of volatility. And all of that -- those dynamics are not going to be helpful from a financing market standpoint, from a deal standpoint, as Scott had mentioned a moment or 2 ago. So I wouldn't read too much into the industry, honestly, in terms of these trailing 90 days. A lot of that activity in private credit does end up being financial sponsor-driven in the framework of new transactions. And we think over time, as you have refinancing opportunities as the market strengthens and as you have that M&A activity from mid-market sponsors pick up, that you'll see deployment in turn, pick up. As I think the overall share is 1 where you're continuing to see a growth in share in private credit broadly. So again, I wouldn't look to read too much into the trailing 90 days.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays.
Benjamin Budish: I kind of wanted to revisit, Scott, some of your comments about fundraising. Just thinking about sort of the more excess caution across the LT base. Could you maybe characterize that a little bit? Is it sort of denominator effect issues? Or is it sort of a broad skittishness that's sort of just delaying all decision-making? And then kind of in the context of the 30 funds you've got coming to market, how much of that is expected to start raising in the back half of the year? Just maybe help us think through the sort of risk that some of that gets pushed further into 2024.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Ben. Look, in terms of the LP dynamics, it really depends on what product area you're talking about, what kind of investor you're talking about. So I'd say where there has been perhaps a bit more caution on the margin has been around U.S. and European pensions. And some of that is definitely a denominator effect as they're trying to get their bearings heading into this year. And some of them are over their alternatives allocation and trying to sort out how much of the budget do they want to spend and how quickly. But that is just that particular segment, and it tends to be more equity-focused as opposed to credit and real estate credit-focused in terms of those dynamics. But when you kind of go broader than that, you got the sovereign wealth funds, we're not feeling that dynamic at all, whether it's Asia or the Middle East, they seem to have a good amount of capital and are looking to put it to work across different asset classes and geographies. Insurance companies, despite the higher base rate, we continue to see a significant amount of interest in what we're doing. And you heard the comments that we're now a couple of hundred billion near enough that we're managing for insurance companies. It's been quite good for their businesses in terms of -- especially on the life and annuity side. And so we're getting the benefit of that growth. The family offices are actually a bit contrarian in this environment and reviewing this, which we agree with, is a great period to put money to work. So we're actually finding family offices leading in. And you can -- you know what we said about private wealth, that's all new. So this is the first time some of these spaces have had access to things like private equity and infrastructure. And so we'll see what all that yields but this is a new dynamic for us. So I wouldn't over-index to just the U.S. and European pensions. And I would say the footnote even on that score, I think some of them have learned from the post-GFC period, where maybe some invested less coming out of the financial crisis than they might have hoped. And so as opposed to turning off, we're finding maybe they're reducing the amount they're committing in this environment but not turning it off. The bigger point I would make is that if you think more broadly across everything that we're doing across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit, there is a significant amount of investor dialogue, both institutions and individuals. So I wouldn't take too much caution from the comments. Just on the margin, we are hearing this from some people. And I think the bank crisis in March probably fed that a bit, but there's also acknowledgment from a number of the people that we're talking to, but they don't want to underinvest or undercommit because I think there's an understanding the next couple of years are going to be a really good investment period. And as your question on the 30 investment strategies, I think most of those will be in the market over the course of the next 12 months, including the back half of this year.
Craig Larson: And the only thing I'd add, Alex, to that last point, Ben, just again, I think the part of the market where we've seen the most headlines and where you're probably seeing the most congestion is in traditional private equity. Again, as we mentioned, we've had a final close on our Europe VI fund, 20% larger than its predecessor, great outcome. Probably worth noting that almost 25% of the LPs in that fund are new investors. They're now new clients of KKR. So we've talked for a long time on these calls of our focus on growing the LP base and the success that we're having there. But more importantly, following on that, again, as we've mentioned, we are now -- we're not going to be in the market with a flagship PE fund this year, and we don't expect to be back in the market until '24 or '25. And we feel fortunate with that timing. And instead, it allows us to focus on deploying that capital. So I think perhaps the traditional PE space might be the 1 place where you might hear people delaying or having the greatest impact on seeing those fundraises be elongated. And we're really fortunate in that we have no activity for the back half of this year.
Scott Nuttall: Maybe just one other macro comment I'd make, Ben, is if you think about this. If you step back and think about our firm, so 15 years ago, we managed about $50 billion of capital; 10 years ago at less than $100 billion; 5 years ago less than $200 billion. We're now in excess of $500 billion. And what we tend to find coming out of periods of time like this, we've got a bit of a market dislocation and the question around economic cycles is investors tend to look back and say what performed when the markets were difficult. And what we found is, over time, alternatives has tended to perform quite well. And usually, what happens coming out of an environment like this is they increase their allocation to alts. Our expectation is that the same thing will happen here. That will be a nice wind at our back as we kind of head into the next several years and launch the flagship funds that Craig was referencing. And then you've got on top of that, the compounding benefit of private wealth. So the reason you hear the optimism in our voices is over the next several years, we actually think we're going to look back on this period of time, I feel like this has been quite helpful and helps fuel the next leg of growth for the industry and for the firm.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.
Michael Kelly: This is Michael Kelly on for Bill. You've seen a nice uptrend in the non-GA-related credit fee rate over the last 4 quarters with a nice step-up in 1Q. Was there anything to call out in the fee rate this quarter? And then how should we think about the trend in that moving forward from here?
Rob Lewin: Thanks, Michael. Nothing specifically to call out. It's a little bit of a mix issue that we're benefiting from. You'd see that uptick, but nothing specifically other than a little bit of mix of product.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo.
Finian O’Shea: Just sort of a follow-up to the last question on the higher fee rate. Is there an ability to rotate sort of the back book into more direct origination now that longer-term yields have come back down? And if so, how would you size that runway or opportunity for, say, optimizing the GA book?
Rob Lewin: And yes, just to clarify for -- just to separate those 2, that question was related to Global Atlantic. When we first purchased Global Atlantic, we spent a lot of time working with the team to make sure that we were very thoughtful around how we rotated the book from GA-sourced assets to KKR-sourced assets. We weren't in a rush. We continue not to be in a rush and that's happened methodically over time. And as a result, you've seen our blended fee rate step up in a pretty balanced way over the last couple of years. Today, our blended fee rate at GA when you cut through all the math is roughly 30 basis points. I think there's some opportunity over time to continue to rotate the book. We'll continue to do that in the most thoughtful way. We can in conjunction with the GA investment team. But I wouldn't expect any market changes from the trajectory that we've had over the last couple of years.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein: Maybe just like zooming out for a second. I was hoping to get your latest perspective on capital management in light of kind of where we are in the cycle. Yourself and, obviously, many of your peers are going through a bit of an earnings lull, but you outlined multiple times now that the firm continues to be really well positioned. You guys have a significant amount of embedded earnings power as you've outlined. So why not lean into the share count shrinkage a little bit more here to take advantage of significantly higher earnings power down the road?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Thanks, Alex. It's a good question, the right question. I'll start with just a broader framework around capital allocation. You probably heard me say this a couple of times before. The most important thing that we can do as a management team is to have a consistent approach. Our approach is very much ROE-based. And ultimately, when we're allocating capital, the question that we are always looking to answer is what is going to drive the best risk-adjusted outcome on a per share basis. There's no more important question than that. And we think, as a management team, moving our marginal dollar of liquidity around to the highest ROE opportunity is a real core competency. Now specifically on the question of share buyback, if you take a look at our body of work, we've had our buyback authorization now in place for several years. We've repurchased or retired 85-plus million shares. That's almost 10% of our shares outstanding. It's well north of 10% of our public float. The average price of which we've bought back or retired those shares by $25 a share. So we really like our body of work. And on top of that, at the same time, if you look back over the past couple of years, whether that's -- excuse me, whether that's KKRM or Global Atlantic, we've completed almost $5 billion of purchase price-related M&A, and we haven't had to issue that many shares to be able to do that -- do those transactions but mostly cash funded. And so when you take a step back, we don't look at share buyback in sort of 1 discrete bucket. We look at capital allocation as a whole. Now all to say, we do expect share buybacks to be a big part of our toolkit on a go-forward basis, and we're going to evaluate them the same way we evaluate all capital allocation. But yes, as we think over the next number of quarters and years, you're going to continue to see us lean into our share count when it makes sense. From a liquidity standpoint, when it makes sense from an opportunity relative to other opportunity sets out there and then obviously where our share price is at. So thanks for the question. Hopefully, that's helpful color in how we, as a management team, value using our marginal dollars of liquidity.
Operator: Our final question is from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo.
Finian O’Shea: Can you touch on the outlook for capital market transaction fees? I think those looked a little strong in the context of the softer environment. Was a lot of this perhaps a one-off? Or has the development of your platform there started to show through and maybe we can expect stable to improving levels throughout the year?
Rob Lewin: Yes. We're really proud of how durable our Capital Markets business has been in what has been a really tough capital markets environment. Obviously, equity markets largely shut. Leveraged finance markets have been largely shut for some period of time. And if you look at our average quarterly revenue over the past four quarters, it's been a little bit north of $100 million per quarter. And so I think it's important to think about that in context of our Capital Markets franchise. 7-plus years ago is probably a $200 million a year business in good markets. 5-plus years ago is probably a $400 million year in good markets type business. And today, our LTM revenue is a little bit north of that $400 million number in a really tough environment. And so no guidance as it relates to forward-looking quarters, but we do look at the performance that the team has been able to generate in a really tough market and feel really great about how we're positioned and do know that when we do come out of this period of time, when markets open back up, we, as a management team, have every expectation that we're going to be talking about a Capital Markets business 3, 5 years from now that's well in excess of the size that it is today for a number of reasons, just how we're positioned competitively, our access to talent. We see a lot of talent potentially coming out of, traditional source of capital markets institutions where we could take advantage of that. And then as KKR expands what we do, that's a real opportunity for our Capital Markets business.
Finian O’Shea: That's very helpful. And one final, if I may. Any color or line of sight on second quarter monetizations?
Rob Lewin: Great. Thanks for that question. It's plus or minus around $125 million of forward look that we have, again, in context of the $9-plus billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll hand the floor back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help, and thank you everyone for your interest in KKR. We look forward to speaking again post our Q2 results. And if you have any questions in the interim, please, of course, follow up with us directly. Thank you once again.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR’s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. And following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I’m joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We’d like to remind everyone that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So this quarter, we’re pleased to be reporting solid results with $0.63 of fee-related earnings per share and $0.92 of after-tax distributable earnings per share. I’ll start by walking through the quarter. So beginning first with management fees. Management fee growth continues to be a real bright spot for us. In Q4, management fees were $706 million, that’s up 5% compared to last quarter, and up 19% compared to Q4 of 2021. And comparing full year 2022 to 2021, management fees increased 28% from $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion. Growth in full year 2022 was greatest within our Real Assets business where management fees increased over 50%. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $195 million, with our Capital Markets business, generating $144 million of revenue in the quarter. Now to go through expenses. Our fee-related compensation margin for the quarter was 20%, which is at the low end of our 20% to 25% range. Rob is actually going to circle back on this topic in a moment. And other operating expenses for us were $177 million. The increase here compared to last quarter was driven by higher professional fees given activity levels across the firm as well as increased expenses related to capital raising. So in total, fee-related earnings for Q4 were $559 million or $0.63 per share with an FRE margin of 61%. Moving to realized performance income. We generated $339 million with realized carried interest driven by monetizations of Minnesota Rubber and Plastics as well as a number of public positions while realized incentive fees were driven by the crystallization of performance fees at Marshall Wace. Realized investment income was $223 million for the quarter. Overall, our asset management operating earnings came in at $946 million. Now turning to our insurance segment. Global Atlantic had another strong quarter, generating $165 million of operating earnings. This quarter, the results were driven by an increase in invested assets from new business growth alongside a continued rotation into higher-yielding assets. This resulted in after-tax DE for us of $822 million, or $0.92 per share. Now turning to investment performance and Pages 7 and 8 of our earnings release. Page 7 shows investment performance across our major asset classes for the fourth quarter as well as the full year. Beginning first with traditional private equity, the portfolio was flat in Q4 and off 14% for the year. Those figures are below public indices for the quarter and ahead of public indices for 2022. In real estate in the quarter, the portfolio was marked down by 8%, driven by a widening of cap rates on unrealized investments, offset some by strong rent growth in the quarter. And for the year, the portfolio appreciated 3% meaningfully ahead of public REITs as well as broad real estate indices. The infrastructure portfolio was up 3% in the quarter and up 9% for the year, very strong performance in infra given broad volatility again across markets. And on the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 3% for the quarter and minus 3% for the year. And our alternative credit portfolio was up 1% in Q4 and up 2% for the year. Volatility in 2022, of course, was not limited to trust the equity markets, investment grade and high-yield indices declined 13% and 11% over the course of the year. Now perhaps more important are the figures that you see on Page 8 of the earnings release. This page shows investment performance since inception across our recent funds that have been investing for two-plus years. The figures you see here, of course, reflects any marks taken in Q4 or over the course of 2022. Looking at this page and taken together, we continue to feel very good about the returns we’ve been generating on behalf of our clients. In terms of our balance sheet investments, performance was flat in the quarter and down 5% for the year, again, against a volatile backdrop. Of note here, core private equity investments on the balance sheet have continued to perform. For the quarter and the year, the core PE portfolio appreciated 7% – excuse me, appreciated 5% and 7%, respectively. Turning to capital metrics. We raised $16 billion in the quarter. This was driven by fundraising across our growth and traditional PE strategies, leverage credit, a block transaction at Global Atlantic alongside incremental flows at GA. This brings our full year 2022 total new capital raised to $81 billion. Our assets under management increased to $504 billion as of 12/31 with fee-paying AUM coming in at $412 billion. We continue to find opportunities to invest deploying $16 billion in the quarter. Infrastructure and traditional private equity accounted for about half of the Q4 deployment with opportunities to disperse globally. And finally, before handing it to Rob, consistent with our historical approach, we’re pleased to announce our intention to increase our annual dividend policy from $0.62 to $0.66 per share. This change will go into effect for the dividend announced alongside first quarter 2023 earnings. And at the same time, we’ve increased our stock repurchase authorization back up to $500 million. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. I thought I would begin by giving you a sense of our recent annual planning meetings. We got our senior team together earlier this year to review where we are as firm, where we’re going and most importantly, what we need to get right to capture the opportunity that is in front of us. Listening and participating in these discussions was incredibly energizing. We’ve never had a stronger team and been more aligned around where we are going as a firm. We have a number of very clear avenues for long-term and sustainable growth and more confidence than ever in our ability to achieve it. I’m going to step through some of these more material opportunities for growth in a minute. But before I do that, I first wanted to emphasize just a few points about 2022. Starting with our fundraising, we raised $81 billion of capital last year, the second most active year in our history and of course, all against a much more complex market backdrop and without significant contributions from our flagship strategies. Over 70% of our fundraising last year came in our real assets and credit businesses, strategies that are often front of mind for our clients in rising interest rate as well as inflationary environments. Moving to deployment, we invested a healthy amount of capital over the last 12 months. Looking at private equity and real assets taken together, deployment here was approximately 20% greater in 2022 compared to 2021 as teams were able to find very creative ways to put capital to work. For example, across PE, growth in Infra, we announced or closed on ten take private transactions over the course of the year. And as our footprint has scaled and become more diversified, so has our deployment. Real asset strategies were 16% of total firm deployment activity in 2020, that number totaled almost 40% in 2022. Over that same two-year period, credit deployment has increased approximately two and a half times as the business has expanded with Global Atlantic as a partner and new focus funds such as asset-based finance. And finally, I’d like to circle back to our compensation expense and the comp margins that you saw in Q4. Fee-related compensation was 20% of fee-related revenues. That is at the low end of the 20% to 25% range that we’ve articulated historically. While realized investment income comp was 10% of realized investment income, also at the low end, in this case, of the outlined 10% to 20% range. Carried interest comp was at the mid of the quarter which, as a reminder, is 65%. This had the impact of reducing our total compensation margin for the quarter, which including equity-based comp, was 32%. Given realized carried interest generation across KKR over the course of 2022, we felt that we could move to the low end of our FRE and investment income compensation ranges and show some expense discipline in support of our operating earnings, while importantly, still ensuring that we have the capacity to recruit, retain and incent world-class investment, distribution and operations talent. As we think about levers that we have as a firm to generate long-term earnings growth from here, operating leverage is really a key component. As a reminder, KKR employees own approximately 30% of our stock. So, we are very well aligned to drive margin improvement across the business. And before I switch gears, let me give you an update on the outlook for Q1 monetization activity. Things have slowed a bit on the monetization side, but nothing that is surprising to us given the environment and how we’re thinking about the timing of when we want to generate realization outcomes for our limited partners. So, as we stand here today, we have visibility on approximately $250 million of monetization-related revenue for the first quarter. Now turning the page and looking forward, we think there are really six key areas that are going to drive significant growth for KKR for several years to come. The first area is real assets, where we have seen meaningful growth across our platform. AUM at the end of Q4 stood at $119 billion. That’s compared to just $28 billion at the end of 2019, so four times growth in three years. Growth in infrastructure has been driven not only by our flagship fund, but also our extension into areas such as core as well as Asia Pacific. The real estate platform continues to grow across a full suite of ten-plus products, further propelled by both Global Atlantic on the credit side and our acquisition of KJRM on the equity side. Our momentum across our real assets platform is obviously quite significant and aligns well with a big area of current focus from our limited partners. The second area of meaningful growth for KKR is continuing to leverage our market-leading position in Asia Pacific. Looking at our progress in 2022, our Asia infrastructure strategy raised almost $6 billion, the largest in the geography, and we closed on our first Asia credit fund as well. Looking ahead, we expect our Asia real estate strategy to expand in 2023 as well our Asia tech growth franchise. And as I mentioned a moment ago, our acquisition of KJRM, which is our Japanese real estate business, is a great example of how we can use our balance sheet to strategically pursue inorganic growth to both enhance our market position as well as to access differentiated forms of capital. Looking at this progress altogether. Our Asia-focused AUM has now increased to $60 billion at the end of the year, that’s up roughly three times since 2019. Our local presence paired with our KKR toolkit has created industry-leading business against very compelling long-term macro fundamentals in the region. The third area for us is core private equity, which is just a massive opportunity. As the addressable market is very significant, and the P&L impact can be positive across so many different parts of our financials. And most importantly, it is an area where we believe that we have the business model and culture that sets us up well to be the best global player in the asset class. As a quick reminder, Core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, and we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15 plus years. We currently have 19 businesses within our core portfolio. These businesses generally have lower leverage than traditional private equity investments tend to be less cyclical and are more cash generative. These traits do create a more stable earnings profile within the portfolio. Today, we manage roughly $18 billion of third-party capital, which I believe is the largest in our space. The AUM we manage positively impacts our management fees, transaction fees as well as carried interest. But core PE also accounts for over 30% of our balance sheet investments. Yet these investments only accounted for 1% of our after-tax distributable earnings in 2022 when you look at their flow-through impact to realized investment income. Looking at this another way, and to highlight this point even further, if you look through our balance sheet to the core PE portfolio, our portion of the company’s EBITDA totals over $600 million. This is not accounted for in our distributable earnings. Make no mistake, this 30-plus percent allocation is purposeful. It is by design because we have a substantial opportunity to really compound our investments in an asset class where we know that we have differentiated capabilities. The fourth big driver for us is private wealth. We currently manage $67 billion of capital here compared to $37 billion in 2019. Approximately 15% of new capital raise has historically been sourced from this investor cohort, mostly from high net worth clients and in traditional drawdown products. Over time, we expect all private wealth focused capital will account for 30% to 50% of the capital that we raised as a firm. And along this path, we will continue to expand our footprint in the democratized access vehicle space. Our ambitions and views of the long-term opportunities we see for KKR have not changed. Next, my fifth point is our continued focus on the insurance space. Going back to July 2020 at the announcement of the Global Atlantic acquisition, their AUM was $72 billion. Today, it’s close to $140 billion. So it’s grown about 2x in the last 2.5 years. Our thesis in buying GA was multifold. We believe that the combination of a leading life and annuity franchise with multiple ways to expand against compelling market fundamentals, combined with KKR’s origination and capital capabilities could lead to strong growth in AUM, operating earnings and book value while also delivering for policyholders. This has really played out and looking ahead remains a key strategic priority for us. Not only is the $139 billion of GE Capital itself perpetual, but the business has also helped us grow our third-party insurance client AUM to $56 billion. That’s up from $26 billion at the time of the GA acquisition announcement as we have continued to create products that are tailored to this unique investor base. And finally, the sixth high-impact long-term growth driver for us is our balance sheet. I said the same thing last quarter as well. But there’s really not a corporate that I know that doesn’t wish they had more capital availability right now. The balance sheet has a clear competitive advantage in its continued ability to enable and accelerate growth in a way that is less dilutive for our public shareholders. To highlight this point, M&A, our investments in core private equity, our buildup in the insurance space and share buybacks have all accounted for roughly 90% of our net balance sheet deployment over the past five years. And we expect that trend to continue over the coming several years as well. This is just another tool that we have to be able to drive earnings per share over time. To summarize, we continue to feel extremely positive about our future outlook. The six drivers that I just went through are particularly impactful for our long-term success, and we have real conviction across the entirety of our management team in our ability to build on our existing momentum. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I thought today, I would share how things look from Joe’s and my seat. There is no doubt that markets and the economy remain dynamic. There’s also no doubt many remaining focused on the macro, quarterly results, short-term catalysts and the near-term outlook for our industry and business. In summary, there’s a lot of noise out there. We find that noise is just that noise. We continue to raise capital, find interesting deployment opportunities and selectively monetize our portfolio. It’s business as usual at KKR. So from our seats, while the noise creates some questions, it’s important to not let it become a distraction. Building KKR is a long-term effort that takes years of planning and investment to get right. Many of the businesses we are scaling now were started over 10 years ago. And many of the businesses we are starting now will be scaling for decades to come. We are singularly focused on what we need to get right: talent, culture, performance, clients and operations. If we get those things right, we will double KKR again at a rapid pace. If we don’t, our growth will be slower than it could be. Growth is the result of execution. So as a management team, we are focused on what we can control and executing on those five fronts. The good news is that as we look back at recent progress, we feel like our strategy is being executed well and the results are emerging. Named just a couple of things we look to as evidence. In the last two years, our AUM has doubled from $250 billion to $500 billion and our fee-paying AUM has more than doubled. And over the same two years, our management fees and TDE per share have almost doubled as well. So the results of execution are starting to come through. But these metrics are backward looking. What’s even more encouraging to us is the strong evidence we have of growth continuing to be very attractive for years to come. Some of this may be apparent for these calls and some less so. To name just a few of the things that we are looking at. First, we’ve continued to create new businesses over the last several years. In fact, over 50% of the capital we raised last year was in strategies that did not even exist five years ago. And over 50% of our AUM is not yet scaled in our definition. Said another way, we have had a lot of recent innovation and half of the assets we now manage are still approaching the inflection part of the growth curve. Second, our dry powder has grown from $67 billion to $108 billion over the last two years, positioning us well to invest into this environment, which we continue to find attractive. Third, our efforts in democratized products are just starting. We expect to have multiple vehicles launched this year after two years of structuring and team building work. This is upside for us and we expect will be an additional growth engine for the firm across all of our asset classes. Fourth, Global Atlantic goes from strength to strength, and has almost doubled assets since we announced the transaction 2.5 years ago, well ahead of schedule with significant opportunity ahead. Fifth, and maybe less visible, our sales team has grown from 100 people to 280 people in the last two years across institutions, insurance, family offices and private wealth. It typically takes a year or two for a new salesperson to learn our products and hit their stride. The result of this investment will show up over the next couple of years and create even more wind at our back. Sixth, our carry-bearing invested dollars in the ground have increased dramatically. It’s important to understand that the cash carry we generated last year largely came from investments we made five-plus years ago when our AUM was a fraction of what it is today and our carry eligible invested capital was as well. To be specific, the vast majority of last year’s carry came from harvesting investments made when our carry earning invested capital was roughly $50 billion. Today, it’s about $150 billion, up 3 times. So don’t let the near-term monetization environment divert your attention from what matters. The forward is incredibly strong as this much larger scale of invested capital matures with the returns on the slide Craig showed you. And finally, and perhaps most important, our team has never been stronger or more cohesive. In summary, over the last several years, we’ve made the investments for the next leg of growth at KKR and see years of opportunity ahead. And as we’ve done all this, the earnings power of KKR continues to increase. This is true regardless of the near-term noise and markets and is what gives us such confidence in our outlook. So don’t get distracted by the noise. The signals are strong and our confidence is high. With that, we’re happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. Hope you’re all doing well.
Craig Larson: Hey Craig, good morning.
Rob Lewin: Hey Craig.
Craig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I wanted to get an update and hear how early stage credit quality metrics have trended inside of this business, especially given prospects that we may be entering a recession in the U.S. in the first half of this year.
Rob Lewin: Hey Craig, it’s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. The very short answer is that GA continues to trend really well as it relates to its credit exposures. We’ve talked about this in prior calls, but 95% of GA’s book is rated NAIC 1 or NAIC 2, so investment-grade in nature. The equity book at GA is sub 1% of total assets. And so we’ve done a bottoms up across the entire portfolio as we’ve gone into year-end and feel really good with how the strength of the balance sheet is holding up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Hey guys, good morning. I was hoping maybe we could talk a little bit about margins and scale in the business. So Rob, this is probably for you. But you guys were able to bring down FRE comp this year partially because of pretty good monetization activity this year, I think, as you alluded in your prepared remarks. So if monetization income weakens in 2023 for variety of cyclical factors, should we think about that drifting back higher? Or is there enough sort of scale in the business where FRE comp rate could be at a lower run rate on a more sustainable basis? And I guess, bigger picture, I was hoping we can maybe just, again, kind of double click into how monetization activity flows through the margins in other parts of the business. You guys report and we sort of think about it in silos, but that’s ultimately not how you sort of pay your people. So wrapping all of that around, we’re hoping get a little more color. Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Got it. Thanks, Alex. A lot in there. So let me try and tackle one at a time. First, let me just start with margins. We believe that we’ve created a business model that allows for best-in-class FRE margins. And we’ve been consistent for a number of quarters now, a number of years now probably that assuming reasonable market conditions. We’ve got a business that can sustainably drive a low 60% FRE margins in spite of some of the investments that we’re making back into our business. But over time, as those investments that we’re making pay off and as the fees come in on the back of those investments as well as the efficiencies, we believe that we can create a business model that delivers mid-60% FRE margins. I think that’s going to come in a couple forms. I think that will come from operating expense leverage. I think it also has the potential to come from compensation expense leverage as you would’ve seen in Q4 of this year. Now taking back to how we thought about compensation margin inside of the quarter, I’d say a couple things as it relates to that. The first, we want make sure that we’ve got and I said this on the prepared remarks, the right amount of compensation in our business such that we can recruit, retain, and incent world-class talent across the board at KKR. And as we looked at the pool of compensation that we had available in 2022, we made the determination that in Q4, we can operate at the bottom end of that range. Now you asked the question of monetization activity comes down next year where might that shake out? I instead would look at it across our total comp margin. And what we’ve guided historically is on a total comp margin, we can operate in the low-40% range. In 2022, we were at 39.7%, I believe, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We were below that 40% guidance number. And if monetization comes down and carried interest comes down, that’s our highest comp margin at 65%. And so all things equal, you would expect compensation margin across the board to come down. So there was a lot in your question, but hopefully I got at most of it and happy to catch up more offline on the topic.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Alex, the only thing I would add is our people understand that monetizations, if they come down, compensation is going to come down as a result. Our business, you get paid on cash outcomes. So I don’t think that would be a surprise to anybody.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So I’m a big believer in the big picture growth picture that you laid out. So cool with that. One of the five things you talked about getting right is performance, and I think your long-term performance is awesome. I want to focus on 2022 for a second, get the right perspective, PE down 14%. I think just the fourth quarter real estate was down 8%, leveraged credit down 3%. I want to – I know it’s a longer tail. I know your long-term track record is great. I wonder if we could talk about the right perspective on portfolio composition or how you do marks relative to Publix – that was only the only Achilles heel that caught my eye in the quarter. Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Hey, Glenn, Glenn, it’s Rob. Thanks for question. Why don’t I just start with valuation methodology because I think that that’s really important for this discussion? Then Craig and Scott could spend some time as it relates to performance. We’ve been reporting as a public entity now for close to 17 years if you include KPE, which was the predecessor closed-end fund the KKR merged into. And we really do believe that over that period of time, we’ve developed best-in-class process for determining fair value for our Level 3 assets, which are those assets that don’t have observable marks. Our exact process and methodology is, of course, by its nature, different by asset class, but what is most important to us is that we have a consistent process and methodology quarter after quarter after quarter. And we believe that aspect is critical in delivering a fair and representative view on fair value, which we think you’ve seen over time and in 2022. I think the other thing that’s worth mentioning on valuation methodology, as part of our consistent process, we’ve got a third-party valuation agent, excuse me, who is an expert in their respective space and they either perform the valuation exercise or provide positive assurance on those investments. So if you look at our history, we feel we’ve gotten that balance right and that our portfolio is certainly impacted by market movements as well as by inputs like interest rates and equity risk premiums that might impact DCFs offset over the course of the year by operating performance as well. And so I think it’s important really to understand that our methodology doesn’t change and it’s consistent quarter-over-quarter. And in that respect, we feel really good that we’re delivering the right representative mark across our portfolio.
Craig Larson: And then Glenn, it’s Craig. I did have – why don’t I just pick up on one of the statistics you mentioned on opportunistic real estate. And there are really two points there. Rob’s already hit on the first just as it relates to the consistency around that process for us and the work we do with evaluation agent. In the case of real estate, specifically that value agent will look at recent transactions and they’ll come up with cap rate and discount rate assumptions for that specific quarter. So in a quarter like Q4, transaction activity was really muted. Volumes in the U.S. were off something like 60%, but in those observable transactions our cap rates widened. And so that’s really what drove the performance figure in real estate that you saw for the quarter. Now, the second point, which we think is more important honestly, is the fundamentals in the portfolio itself. As our – we continue to feel great about the portfolio as well as those fundamentals. So our exposures continue to be weighted towards those assets and themes where you’re seeing strong fundamentals and strong growth. Industrial assets, data centers, rental housing, student housing, storage, those are over 80% of the portfolio in total, and we’re seeing strong fundamentals and cash flow growth there. On the flip side, we globally have only 1% exposure to retail, and our U.S. office exposure is below 5%. And then just to help put those two things together, to give you a sense, if we had used constant cap rate and discount rate assumptions in Q4, you actually would’ve seen the portfolio marked up in the quarter instead of that down for the quarter percentage that you did see. So again we are really benefiting from strong underlying NOI growth, and that dynamic is really the reason that we put in Page 8. So I think as our clients evaluate us across our strategies, they’re looking at this inception performance, much less focused on any 90 day period, et cetera. And I think when you look at, since inception, as you noted and we appreciate that in your beginning of the question, the performance figures and in the case of real assets and real estate, the blue bars, I think we feel great about how we’ve been performing on behalf of our clients.
Scott Nuttall: Hey Glenn, it’s Scott. Just – if I were you, I’d be trying to figure out is there anything to worry about here? And the punchline from my standpoint is no. I think as the guy said, we’ve had a very consistent methodology. It’s not at all surprise given the markets have been off, multiples have been off, they see some marks come down, but they’re just that marks. What matters to us is the fundamental operating performance of the portfolio, which continues to be really strong. If anything, we feel even better that we got it right in terms of investing behind the right themes the last several years, revenue and profitability metrics remain strong. The fundamental operating performance of our real asset book and our credit book remains strong, candidly, bit stronger than I might have expected given what’s going on with the economy and the backdrop. So, overall we’re not worried about it. I would suggest you’re not worried about it either. My expectation is as markets rebound, you’ll see the marks rebound as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you’ve done a great job expanding into a number of adjacent strategies and products over the past several years. I’m curious though, as we think about the next three to five years, should we expect this expansion into new areas to persist or will more of the focus be going deeper in the strategies you have today and moving more of these platforms from earlier stages of the life cycle to more mature and scale stages?
Rob Lewin: Brian, thanks for the question. I think it’s going to be much more focused around taking what we have today and scaling that up. We think there’s more than enough room to have very substantial growth. And as we’ve outlined, our 2026 profitability measure is greater than $4 of FRE per share, $7 of TD per share, that doesn’t rely on adding a lot of new products that we’re doing. That said, we continue the focus on innovation. We are likely to add products over time where we believe there’s large addressable markets and where we can be a top player in the world of what we do. But that list is going to be small because I think we believe that if we go execute on what we have in front of us today take that 50% of our products that aren’t yet at scale and get them to scale that the growth opportunity is going to be much larger than starting something new from scratch.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Brown: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to start with GA. It’s clearly a strong quarter there. And then given the favorable rate backdrop and the good new business trends that you’ve been seeing, any thoughts on how we should think about the next six to 12 months from that business? If you could maybe touch on the net investment income and the net cost of insurance, that would certainly be helpful. Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Clearly, Global Atlantic in the two years of our ownership has had really outstanding performance. And we had targeted 12% to 13% type of ROEs. We’ve out achieved that over the course of 2021 and again in 2022. I do still believe that that’s the right level which to model GA on a go-forward basis. We are benefiting right now on the investment – net investment side of the business, we’re certainly benefiting from greater deployment as we’ve rotated on our portfolio, which we took some upfront losses on given where interest rates are and have put that into higher-yielding securities. We’ve also benefited while we are pretty well asset liability matched. We do have a decent size floating rate book. And so as interest rates have gone up, GA has benefited from that as well. At the same time, though, cost of insurance has, of course, gone up the price at which we price our annuities has gone up. But I think the team has done a really good job on the operating expense side of the business. And overall, you’re seeing that operating leverage flow through. So, we continue to be really encouraged. I think 12% to 13% still the right range to model that business going forward, and hopefully, they’re going to continue to be able to outperform.
Operator: Our next question is from Gerry O’Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Gerry O’Hara: Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Obviously, fund raising [ph] remains a topical item. So just sort of hoping you could comment a little bit on how conversations with LPs have been evolving over the past several months. And also to the extent you might be able to sort of address this whole dynamic around LP allocations and their sort of “budget” as we look into 2023 and beyond. Thank you. 
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Gerry, it’s Scott. I’ll take that one. It’s hard to answer that question in Chris [ph] fashion because it kind of depends on where you are and who you’re talking to. So there’s no doubt, kind of as we got into the back half of last year, some of our LPs were struggling with allocations on the back of a reduced denominator, that was predominantly a U.S. pension fund dynamic. As the calendar has turned, and there’s a new budget year, some of that has softened and we’re having conversations that indicate they’re looking to put capital to work. But if you go outside the U.S., Middle East, Asia, sovereign wealth, insurance, in particular, you find investors aren’t struggling with those same issues. In fact, several of them are very forward leaning and trying to figure out how to invest into this environment. So the overall picture is not consistent depending on where you are. What is very consistent, though is, we’re finding this year, just like last, a lot of interest in a couple of themes. Anything with inflation protection and yield. So, I think real estate, infrastructure, credit, significant amount of interest. I’d say an increased awareness that in times like this, all things, private equity tend to perform quite well. So it should be some very strong vintage years coming out of this period of time. So people are kind of swinging a bit to think about how to take advantage of this environment. So, I’d say people are more in their front foot this year overall than maybe last year. And there’s more of the conversations gearing toward how do I invest into this in a thoughtful way. And then part of that is people look back and post-GFC and maybe post the initial stages of COVID, some of which they were maybe a little bit more aggressive in terms of deploying into the environment spend. And I think that’s what’s leading to some of this shift in sentiment.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Katz: Okay thank you very much. Good morning everyone and appreciate taking the question. Maybe circling back to one of your growth drivers. If you could talk a little bit about on the global private wealth opportunity. You mentioned a couple of new products coming out. Maybe update us on what you’re hearing from the respective channels, just given some of the mixed macro backdrop with higher yields in more liquid products. And what might be having in terms of behavior and demand as you scale the business? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Bill, it’s Craig. Why don’t I start? Look, I think the tone in any near-term period is going to be influenced by what we all see in broad markets. But I think we’d encourage everybody not to miss what really is a huge opportunity for us. And when we look at how we’re positioned with our brand, our track record, our ability to innovate the relationships that we enjoy with distribution partners. I think some of the things that Scott mentioned in our prepared remarks, we spent the better part of the last two years really as a firm positioning ourselves to be able to launch a handful of new products, and we’re on the cusp of currently. So, I think we just feel really well positioned in what is an enormous massive addressable market. And again, our views of the opportunity here hasn’t changed. And I think, I guess one final thought in a product like KREST, again, we think the performance of KREST and the experience that people have had with that as an entry has been great. So performance was an 8% – over an 8% return in 2022, 16% inception to date, over a 5% current yield. So, I think when we look at the initial experience that investors have had from the democratize products, we feel very good about what they’ve experienced.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Davitt: Thanks, good morning. I have another follow-up on the real estate market. Is there any specific region or specific type of assets in the portfolio where those transaction cups – comps drove the mark? And as a follow-up to that, could you give us an idea of where the cap rates were moved to and where they were before?
Craig Larson: Patrick, we haven’t disclosed the specific cap rates. I think the dynamic this quarter is, one, I think I wouldn’t be – we wouldn’t be surprised if you’d actually see a real variability in those cap rate assumptions is, again, it’s – each manager is probably going to view the data points differently. And what you’re going to see in this 90-day period. And again, like the book that we have is going to be predominantly U.S. based just given the maturation of our portfolio. And again, from an overall exposure piece, as I’d mentioned, our largest allocation is 35% in those industrial themes and 80% in those themes where we’re continuing to see really strong growth. But almost by definition, those are going to have the big – just given the significance of those in the portfolio, those are the instances that are going to be the biggest contributors to that movements in the court. [Ph]
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Just wanted to come back to the retail democratized part of the retail strategy. Maybe if you could just remind us on the AUM you have right now in the actual democratized products where you might think that could go to over the long term. Realize it’s a – it’s definitely a long-term build. And then, how many products you plan to launch this year? And then, going back to the FRE margin, part of that as you scale the overall business and improve the FRE margins, should we be thinking of the rollout of those democratized products as a near-term headwind as you pay for shelf space and build up the infrastructure to scale that?
Craig Larson: Hi, Brian. It’s Craig. Why don’t I start? And then, we’ll let Rob pick up on the FRE margin impact. Just in terms of framing that significance for us, again, we’ve got about 500 billion of AUM, roughly 6 billion are in these democratized vehicles today. So it’s a little over 1% of our AUM. In terms of the launch of additional products and where we are from here, given SEC rules and filings that we’ve made, we can’t get into a lot of the specifics. But suffice to say we think there’s more to come in the first half of the year, and we’ll keep you abreast as we continue to make progress.
Rob Lewin: Brian, some of those costs that you reference are costs that we’ve talked about, where we’ve been investing back into the firm in distribution and marketing as well as in technology. Some of that technology supports our efforts in the democratized vehicles. So as we talk about operating in the low 60s and over time, gravitating our business model to get to the mid-60s, that incorporates how we’re thinking about the democratized access vehicle space.
Scott Nuttall: And Brian, the only thing I’d add is, we’ve said over time, if you look at kind of what we’ve been selling to individual investors, so think democratized plus the more traditional fund formats sold through platforms to individuals, that’s been roughly 10% to 15% of the capital we’ve been raising ex-GA. And we’ve said that we expect that over time to trend to 30% to 50%. So to your question of where do we think this goes over time, think of it as kind of an increasing percentage of a larger base. And we’ve also shared over time that we expect to have democratized versions of what we’re doing across all of our major product areas in the near term and that’s still the case.
Operator: Our next question is from Finian O’Shea with Wells Fargo Security. Please proceed with your question.
Finian O’Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A follow on to the insurance ROE, appreciate your color on portfolio rotation into higher yields driving the impact, with that considered, how long should we expect the normalized ROE remaining elevated in today’s environment with today’s portfolio understanding the inputs can be hard to predict?
Rob Lewin: Yes, Fin, thanks for the question. Listen, I do think that 12% to 13% range continues to be a good one for next year. And while there’s some things that can elevate that number as we look forward, there were some timing elements in 2022 as well on that portfolio rotation. So I think that’s still the good range for the near term. As I said, we hope that the GA team is able to generate returns that are in excess of that. They’ve done that in 2021 and 2022. But our internal modeling suggests that’s the right range for 2023.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on deployment, just curious how you would characterize the 71 billion of capital that was deployed in 2022. Seems like a large quantum of capital, similar level as 2021, but a tougher backdrop. So just curious how you’d characterize that relative to your full potential? And what’s the scope for that deployment to say grow at a meaningfully step function higher level, maybe in 2023 or 2024. Just how you’re thinking about the capacity you have to deploy and what that might look like five years from now? And then just a quick housekeeping question for Rob, just if you could help quantify the investments and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Mike. It’s Craig. Why don’t I start on deployment. I think a couple of things. When you look at our activities, one, look, the primary markets are pretty shut. Capital is very precious. Those are good things for us in particularly when you look at a 100 plus billion of dry powder that we have as a firm. So I think when we look back at our activities in 2022, I think we feel very good about capital that we put to work. We’re value focused. We love carve-outs. One of the things Rob talked about that I think is pretty interesting against just the amount of public to privates we did in an environment where public markets are really dislocated. So I think for us to have announced or closed on 10 take privates is a pretty interesting statistic. Eight of those were done outside of the U.S. in private equity, infrastructure, real estate. So I think on balance we feel really good about that balance of activity. A couple of other thoughts just, if you look at deployment, some statistics that as we go through things, it’s always kind of interesting to reflect back. I think one, you’re seeing real diversification. So in 2022, traditional private equity deployment for us was $14 billion, real estate was $14 billion, infrastructure was $13 billion. So I think when you look back at this – it’s really a reflection of how the firm has meaningfully grown and diversified by strategy and by geography. Kind of brings us to the second point which is some of the growth you’ve seen. So in real assets, as an example is our infra and real estate footprint has grown, you’ve seen deployment grow meaningfully. Rob gave some of the statistics earlier on AUM growth in these businesses, but real assets deployment in 2018 through 2020 averaged a little over $4 billion a year be equally split between infra and real estate. Last year, that was $28 billion. So again, we’ve gone from $4 billion to $28 billion, again pretty equally split between those two businesses for us. And the third point, and I think this is not as well understood, but it’s interesting when you look at private equity deployment for us, as I think there’s a – again, I think we look at – we feel good about when we deployed where we leaned in. Let me give you a couple of statistics there. So I think in 2020 during COVID, I think everyone remember, we leaned in. So our deployment was around 33% higher in 2020 versus 2019. I think we are more active than our peers. I think people remember that. In 2021, it almost felt like the industry felt the need to play catch-up and industry deployment was up materially. So in the U.S., PE investment activity in 2021 was more than double 2020. I think that’s what many people remember and in some ways, fear. For us, deployment was flat. So again, you didn’t see any kind of an acceleration into that really throughout the environment. And then in 2022, again a year with a lot of volatility and challenge debt markets as you noted, deployment for the industry was down over 20%, deployment for us and private equity was up 35%. So again, I think you’ve seen this really thoughtful dynamic over time of how we look to deploy and take advantage of dislocation. And then the final point just relates to credit. Again, that same scaling thought. So in 2019, total credit deployment was $10 billion. 2020, that deployment was $10.3 billion, and last year deployment for us was $25 billion. So as the credit business has grown, as GA has come online, you’ve seen a meaningful increase in that deployment. So again, long-winded answer, but hopefully that gives a little bit of flavor for the activities you saw last year.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only color I’d add to that, Mike, is if you take the numbers apart you’re right, deployment was relatively flat in the low $70 billion in 2022 versus 2021. But if you look at the makeup, there’s a bit of a shift. Credit was actually down year-over-year. Part of that is overall transaction activity in the market, part of it is we had a lot of work on the GA front to do in 2021, in particular. But if you look at private markets, I think private equity, infrastructure and real estate our deployment was actually up 20%. So we were leaning in to Craig’s point into kind of what was happening with the markets last year after maybe being a little bit more cautious in late 2021 in a high valuation environment.
Rob Lewin: Then Mike, real quickly our realization deployments were about $400 million for the quarter off the balance sheet.
Operator: Our next question is from Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Please proceed with your question.
Arnaud Giblat: Good morning. If I could just follow up quickly on the last question. Could you talk about a bit about the outlook a bit more on deployments? Are you seeing financing conditions improve in private equity? Is the bidder spread starting to narrow a lot of the participants in the industry are talking about that as an issue? Is that improving? And equally, if you could comment a bit more on infra. I mean that’s obviously been a very active area of the market. How are you seeing the pipeline of opportunities for deploying there?
Craig Larson: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on deployment, I looked at the debt markets haven’t fully healed, but despite that, we’ve continued to find ways to deploy capital. I do think the capital markets business actually gives us a real leg up in helping to put together the debt side of a cap structure. Where we’re interested now would include those areas where we think we can really bring our operational resources to bear and move the needle. Again, we love carve-outs. We’ve been very active public to privates. I think by strategy, you actually hit on probably the single busiest area in our firm, and that’s infrastructure. And I think infrastructure has just continued to be a real success story and a real growth story for us. I think it’s – when we look back at our April 2021 Investor Day, we gave a bunch of statistics there of actually where we thought Infra would be over the course of 2022. Just to give you a sense, at that point Infra-AUM was $17 billion. We estimated at that Investor Day that Infra-AUM would exceed $30 billion and as of year-end we’re at $51 billion against that $30 billion estimate all organic. We look for management fees effectively to double from that $150 million to $275 million to $300 million was our estimate for 2022. And for the full year, infra management fees came in at $340 million, so nicely ahead of the top end of that range. And we’ve got $9 billion of infra for capital that will become fee-paying as it’s invested at a weighted average fee rate of about 120 basis points. So not only will we build the high end, but we’ve got lots of visibility towards future management fee growth. And I think as we look at opportunities for us, that opportunity for continued growth and innovation hasn’t stopped. So again, we think it’s an asset class that can lend itself nicely to the democratized marketplace. And we think the renewable space is again an area where our presence can increase. So I appreciate you’re asking about, but it’s been a real bright spot for us.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only color I’d add, Arnaud, is that our pipelines have been strong this year across asset classes. And I think to your question, it does take about a year for the public and private market valuations to start to align. We’re getting close to lapping that, and we’re starting to see that show up in the pipeline.
Operator: Our next question is from Rufus Hone with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
Rufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a follow-up question on Global Atlantic. I was just curious to get your thoughts around the outlook for inorganic growth for GA in the coming quarters. Any color on the pipeline that would be helpful. And would you consider raising or bringing on third-party investors to accelerate organic growth and M&A even further? Thank you. 
Rob Lewin: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rufus. You’ve hit on a spot of a lot of activity, actually. And our pipeline around the institutional side of our business at Global Atlantic as frankly is big as it’s been certainly since our ownership and probably since Jay’s founding. And so a lot of resources going into the institutional side of the business. And that’s both in the U.S., but that’s also global. I think there’s a real opportunity to leverage KKR’s franchise in Europe and Asia to help Global Atlantic grow in those parts of the world. So a lot of effort there. We do have today, as you talk about third-party close capital, we do have side car pool capital called IV Today [ph] that participates alongside some of our block reinsurance activity. It’s a big part of our go-forward strategy, and I would certainly look to continue to be able to add capacity to the IV strategy to help support Global Atlantic and its growth in the future.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the core private equity business. And I think if I heard him correctly, I think Rob referenced that it’s $600 million of EBITDA which is about 15% of your pretax earnings, but only 1% of DE. And I guess I’m wondering when and how – what is your philosophy or outlook on when and how the EBITDA starts converting into DE. I mean, do we have to wait 15 or 20 years until these investments are mature and ready to be monetized? Are these companies in a position where they can start throwing off steady dividends? Or do the cash flows have to be reinvested to keep the growth going? Or are there dividend recaps down the line? Or what is the, I guess, the strategy for converting the EBITDA into DE for KKR shareholders?
Scott Nuttall: Really appreciate the question, Chris. Let me start. Really, what we want to do first is highlight to you and all of our shareholders the fact that we think there is a fantastic portfolio that we’re building in core that is generating a significant amount of underlying value creation. And you’re right, it’s not yet showing up in our distributable earnings. Part of that – the reason for that is because we report DE, which as you know, is a cash metric. These investments by their very nature amend for a very long period of time. So it shows up in our marked book value per share, but not in DE. And you’re right, we would need to sell them or we would need to pay dividends or do some kind of a dividend recap for actually needed to show up in DE. But even that, I think would understate the quality of the underlying earnings because these businesses are designed to have recurring revenue and recurring bottom line. And so part of what we’re doing now is just sharing with you that we’ve got a little bit of that disconnect that we’re building this portfolio that we feel great about. As the largest shareholder, and we think it will show up in some parts of the financial statements but not others today. Some of these businesses will start to pay dividends in the near term. So we’ll share that with you as we go along. But one of the things that we’ve been discussing is how over time, can we make it even more clear the value that’s being created in that part of our strategy and what are the ways to do that. And just 1 example, Global Atlantic, as you know, we consolidate our share of GA’s earnings, which is a long-term compounding investment that has a lot of other strategic benefits to it but not dissimilar to some of the things that we’re doing with the core portfolio in terms of the underlying. It’s just GA shows up in earnings and core today doesn’t at least yet. So part of what we want to do is create a dialogue with you and our shareholders so you know what we’re seeing. And then over time, we’ll discuss how can we actually remedy that, but it’s a good problem, not a bad problem.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson : Rob, thanks for your help this morning, and thank you all for your continued interest in KKR, and we look forward to giving you further updates on our progress in the quarters ahead. Thanks again, everybody.
Rob Lewin: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead, sir.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I'm joined by Rob Lewin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis.  This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.  I'm going to begin the call by spending a few minutes walking through the quarter. So we look at our results, I think they really highlight the resiliency of our business model. Our management fees for the quarter were $671 million. That's up 20% compared to Q3 of last year. Management fee growth for the quarter as well as over the last 12 months has been most meaningful within our Real Assets business which, as you'll recall, we began reporting separately last quarter. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $168 million for the quarter with capital markets contributing $116 million.  To go through our expenses. Our fee-related compensation margin consistent with prior quarters, was 22.5%, and other operating expenses increased modestly from last quarter, coming in at $146 million.  In total, our fee-related earnings grew to $542 million or $0.61 per share with an FRE margin of 61%. The -- this is now the eighth consecutive quarter that our FRE margin has exceeded 60%. Next, realized performance income was $498 million, with realized carried interest driven by monetizations of CHI overhead doors, Fiserv as well as Max Healthcare. Realized investment income was $285 million, driven by similar monetization events.  Adding these 2 lines together, so looking at realized performance income, together with realized investment income, really to get a complete picture of our monetization activities Total realized gains for the first 9 months of the year are 10% ahead of last year, given all of the volatility experienced across markets in 2022, we think this speaks to the breadth of our platform, and again, the resiliency of our business model.  So overall, our Asset Management operating earnings were $959 million. And our Insurance segment had another very strong quarter, generating $127 million of operating earnings. Together, this resulted in after-tax distributable earnings of $824 million or $0.93 per share.  Turning to investment performance. You can see the details of the quarter and the LTM period on Page 7 of the press release. Just looking at this page, the traditional private equity portfolio was down 4% in the quarter compared to broad indices that were down 5% to 6%. And over the last 12 months, the PE portfolio was minus 8% compared to the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices that were down 15% and 19%, respectively.  In Real Assets, our portfolio has continued to perform again in a quarter with a lot of volatility. The opportunistic real estate portfolio was minus 1% in the quarter and plus 11% over the last 12 months, while the infra portfolio was up in the quarter and is plus 5 LTM.  On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was up 1% in the quarter and down 5% over the last 12 months, and our alternative credit portfolio was down 1% for the quarter and up 3% in the LTM. There's been meaningful volatility in the credit markets over these periods as well. The high-yield index declined 1% in the quarter and is off 15% over the last 12 months just as a point of comparison.  In terms of our balance sheet investments, investment performance was flat in the quarter and down 5% over the last 12 months. Core private equity, which Rob will touch on in a moment and is still our largest allocation, was up 2% in the quarter, and it's up 8% over the LTM.  Turning to fundraising in the quarter. We raised $13 billion, bringing new capital raised to $65 million year-to-date.  With that, our assets under management increased to $496 billion, and fee paying AUM now totals $398 billion. To help put these figures into perspective, over the past 2 years, both our AUM and our FPAUM have more than doubled. We also continue to deploy capital with $16 billion invested in Q3. And Credit strategies invested $7 billion in the quarter, with the remainder of the quarter's deployment roughly split between real assets and private equity.  And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. As you know, the third quarter and really the first 9 months of 2022, were very challenging across markets. High levels of inflation are clearly impacting global consumers, while the sharp increase in interest rates has had multiple knock-on effects that will invariably slow much of the global economy. In turn, equity and bond indices have been very volatile and virtually all of them are down significantly year-to-date. And capital markets activity has meaningfully slowed. Global equity and credit issuance is significantly below historical norms.  Now despite all of this volatility and uncertainty, the overall mood and sentiment across KKR is quite positive. And we thought it would be worthwhile this morning to go through 5 key reasons why we feel the way we do.  First, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods like this one. There are a few key reasons why. About 90% of our capital is perpetual or committed for an average of 8 years or more from inception. Our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital. And as a result, are more insulated from fluctuating NAVs of our funds. Therefore, much of our management fees are highly predictable, and that visibility in turn, provides us with the continued ability to invest back into the firm for growth.  We also have $43 billion of committed capital yet to turn on that has a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points. And finally, and may be most critical in moments like these, we have $113 billion of uncalled capital from our investors that we can use to invest into the current dislocation.  While those statistics are all meaningful in their own right, I think it's also helpful when viewed in comparison to where we were as a firm, even a short while back. 2.5 years ago, March 31, 2020. So right as we entered COVID, we had $57 billion of dry powder with $19 billion of committed capital yet to earn management fees. That compares to the $113 billion and $43 billion I mentioned a moment ago. So both of these figures have doubled more or less over the last 2.5 years. And when you consider our relative positioning as a firm, those numbers don't account for the significant increase we have had in perpetual capital. largely due to our partnership with Global Atlantic and our acquisition of KJRM as well as the meaningful increase in the diversification of our business, both by geography and strategy.  This brings me to my second reason for optimism. We're fortunate due to our fundraising success and definitely a bit of luck on timing that we are in a position to deploy a significant amount of dry powder with asset prices more dislocated and while capital is quite scarce.  As a result, we are starting to become a lot more constructive on our opportunity sets. We are already finding opportunities across the credit landscape. Our real estate and corporate credit teams are all very active. But more exciting is our outlook for the coming 12 to 18 months across all asset classes and geographies. We are mobilizing our teams and resources against what we see as a growing opportunity to put our client capital to work.  Take for example, in private equity. Oftentimes, our best vintages result from investments made during periods of market distress. Think the early 2000s, the GFC or what we went through a couple of years ago. We think 2023 could present such an opportunity. And the key here is that we have really set ourselves up to be able to outperform in this environment, given our expertise and breadth across geographies, industries and asset classes.  And most importantly, our culture really incentivizes our people to work across the firm to ensure that both information and capability travel and that we can make each other better. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to find creative and attractive investment opportunities.  Turning now to performance, which is my third point. Please turn to Page 8 of the earnings release. As Craig went through every quarter, we report our investment performance for the quarter and trailing 12-month period across our major asset classes. This really though, only tells part of the story as it doesn't capture investment returns since inception. These funds all continue to outperform their comparable public indices. Our clients, really all channels relying us to produce differentiated outcomes compared to what they can achieve in traditional asset classes. And that is just what we've been doing.  Now to be clear, we certainly have today and will, in the future, a handful of more difficult situations to manage. But our thematic approach, which we have talked about many times, and our focus on portfolio construction, are 2 critical reasons why you see this kind of outperformance, which brings me to my fourth point. The strength of our fund performance continues to allow us to raise capital from our investors.  Q3 new capital raised of $13 billion brings year-to-date fundraising to $65 billion. To put that number in perspective, that's already our second best year of fundraising ever, and we still have a quarter to go.  Even more notably, this was against a much more challenging fundraising backdrop than the past few years and with many of our largest flagships in the market. And looking ahead over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to have a really active calendar and remain constructive about the outlook for scaling our strategies that are coming to market.  And finally, I want to turn to my fifth point. and focus on the competitive differentiation that our balance sheet creates in periods like these. There's not a corporate that I know that doesn't wish they had more capital availability right now. And we are very confident in our ability to deploy our excess capital in opportunities that can both generate compelling investment returns and also help build and scale the firm at the same time.  Part of what generates this confidence is the strength of our existing investment portfolio. Our focus on asset allocation and really where the puck is going, has served us well. While the S&P 500 declined 15% over the last 12 months, our balance sheet was off only 4.7%.  And over the last 3 and 5 years, our annual returns have been 16% and 14%. Also several hundred basis points ahead of the S&P over these periods. One of the key drivers of this outperformance is the shift that we made a few years ago to increase our exposure to real assets. The fair value of our real assets investments have increased from $2.4 billion 2 years ago,to $4.2 billion as of 9/30 and today represent almost 1/4 of our investment portfolio.  Our largest allocation on the balance sheet remains core private equity, and this really gets into business building and how the balance sheet allows us to play offense. As a reminder, core PE is a long-duration investment strategy, where we expect to hold these investments for 10 to 15-plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to our traditional private equity model. We're looking for mid- to high-teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile.  So from a standing start 6 years ago, we've put together this really incredible global portfolio of 17 companies with $32 billion of AUM that is both third-party capital together with balance sheet capital. We believe we have the largest core asset management business in the world. And as shareholders, we are all participating in core PE through the compounding of value on our balance sheet, alongside the management fees, capital markets revenue, fee-related earnings and carried interest that is generated over time. That combination is incredibly powerful.  Our acquisition of Global Atlantic in July 2020, right on the heels of COVID, is perhaps the best example of how our balance sheet positions us to play offense when others could not during that period of severe dislocation. We have deep conviction that GA can be a long-term compounder of capital much like core private equity, and we are partnered here with a first rate management team. So far, GA has been performing exceptionally well. Over the last 12 months, they have generated an ROE of about 21%. And well ahead of our expectations. While AUM has increased from approximately $70 billion at announcement to over $130 billion as of 9/30, really helping to also drive our asset management economics.  Core Private Equity and Global Atlantic are great examples, but they're just 2 of many. We know that our model will continue to allow us to find ways to use the balance sheet where we can simultaneously generate compelling investment returns and also use it to grow and scale the firm at the same pace. We have also created a liability structure on our balance sheet that allows for playing real offense in this environment.  We have very intentionally funded ourselves with long-dated liabilities that have fixed cost of capital. The average maturity of our recourse debt is around 20 years, and it is a weighted average fixed coupon of approximately 3% after tax. Obviously, that just isn't replicable today and represents a huge asset for us right now. With all of this, hopefully, it's clear why we remain so excited about our long-term opportunities.  So in summary, number one, our model is durable and diverse with significant recurring revenues. Two, the next 12 to 18 months should present great deployment opportunities and we are extremely well positioned to invest into them. Number three, we are generating excellent investment performance on behalf of our clients. And fourth, our fundraising success has been notable, especially given the backdrop, and we remain very well positioned to achieve growth from here. And finally, number five, our balance sheet is a strategic differentiator whose value is even more meaningful in moments like these.  The opportunity set in front of us over the next 5 to 10 years is immense, and we have never felt better positioned competitively. That's why the tone inside the firm is so constructive right now. Our long-term goals that we have articulated for 2026 are unchanged, and we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to achieve that.  And with that, Scott, Craig and I are happy to take any questions that you have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein: Apologies for two putter, but promise they're kind of related. So just starting with private equity. So financing costs are obviously up pretty meaningfully growth slower, credit spreads are widening. So I hear the optimism to deploy capital, but curious how you're thinking about deployment in private equity specifically, and how are the return profile of where you could deploy money today varies versus what you could have done a couple of years ago? In other words, are you still underwriting to high teen to 20% IRRs. And I guess the lower multiples, the lower entry multiples enough to offset both the growth headwinds as well as higher financing costs. And then I had a quick follow-up just on the growth in private equity management fees for the next 12 to 18 months.
Craig Larson: Alex, thank you for the multiple partner. Why don't I start? Look, a couple of observations just on deployment. One, public market and why do we start there, public market valuations have obviously come down very meaningfully. Our macro team does this work every quarter where they look across a breadth of markets and asset classes and look at current valuations versus a 20-year average and Japanese equities, as an example, are at 8% of their long-term average. That's just 1 example. That's a pretty remarkable statistic.  And at the same point in time, capital is obviously very precious, as you noted. So I think the combination of markets coming down, together with capital being very precious is a great thing for us. And we have lots of tools at our disposal in terms of finding ways to be relevant. I expect you remember our deployment history during COVID again, in a period which even arguably was more dramatically dislocated and more dramatically shut down. I think we feel great about the connectivity that we had as a firm and the opportunities that we were able to find in terms of deploying capital in private equity and private markets broadly. And I guess the final thought that I'd make just as it relates to the financing market is, look, we have 70 people globally in our capital markets business and the strategic value of this business increases during periods of volatility and distress. And so I think as it relates to our ability to finance transactions, given our position, the best-in-class talent we have here on a global basis, our ability to access and finance the capital markets during periods of distress is actually something that we think of as being as a real competitive advantage for us.
Scott Nuttall: Alex, it's Scott. Just a couple of things I'd add on to what Craig said. You're right. Financing costs are up. I'd say multiples, generally speaking, are down more than financing costs are up. And if you look kind of over time and you run out the math, paying a little bit more to get the financing in place, doesn't have that large an impact on returns as long as you've got the right assets, the right thematic and you're able to make the company better while you own it. So the bottom line is we are still pricing the IRRs to where we were before. It's just a bit of a different mix.
Craig Larson: And then, Alex, switching to your question as it relates to management fees across private equity and growth from here. Obviously, as you know, a couple of our big flagships, we got done over the last 12 to 24 months. But we continue to raise a number of adjacent products that we're excited about that are in their scaling phase. And also remember that our core private equity business is a business that generates management fees as capital is deployed as opposed to committed capital at the onset of the fund. And so as we continue to deploy capital and core private equity, you should see some natural growth there as well. So we're constructive as it relates to growth in our private equity management fees over the coming quarters. And then obviously, at some point there in the future, we'll have a reraise of our flagship strategies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.
Craig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I wanted to see how early stage credit quality metrics have trended inside of GA in 3Q. And we know it's coming off very strong levels, but have you seen a pickup in delinquencies, non-accruals, criticized assets, OTTI. And then if the U.S. does enter an economic recession next year or at least if the economy does slow a lot, do you expect to see a pickup in OTTI next year off of a very, very low base currently?
Robert Lewin: Great. Craig, thanks for the question. So the short answer is that we have not seen any deterioration of credit quality across Global Atlantic. And as you look forward and as you look at different sensitivities, we feel really good with how that book is positioned. I would note that of their NAIC rated assets, that 95-plus percent of them are NAIC 1 or 2, so investment-grade in nature. And so we feel really good about the underlying strength of the book at Global Atlantic.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.
Gerald O'Hara: Just kind of circling back, I guess, on some comments made in some of the recent quarters. just around the expansion of platform distribution for some of the democratized retail products. Hoping we could get an update there. And perhaps any kind of commentary around flows in the quarter would also be helpful.
Craig Larson: Gerry, it's Craig. I'm glad you asked about why don't I start? First, just to your specific question on flows. We did see new capital raise in the quarter slow versus Q2 with volatility in the quarter. I guess we're not really terribly surprised by that. So new capital raise across all of our democratized products was about $500 million in the quarter, and KREST would have been about half of that.  Now what that doesn't tell you is all that's going on under the hood because there's quite a lot. I think first, just as it relates to Crest and distribution, there are 3 main wire houses in the U.S. As you know, we've been on 1 of those since we launched 15 months ago and we're really pleased with our market share and our positioning there. We were added to a second warehouse in August and then launched on the third right at the very end of September. So with all the volatility in the quarter and the timing of these launches, you're not really seeing the impact of that in our 9 to 30 numbers, but the breadth of our distribution there certainly increased in the quarter.  Second, we did make a series of filings, as you may have seen on our infrastructure products. Now unfortunately, not that we have an active registration statement on file, there isn't a lot of additional detail we can give you here because of the SEC's private placement rules, but I wanted to highlight that as something noteworthy.  Third, we have made additional filings on additional private equity as well as credit products in the quarter. And fourth, we continue to hire and onboard and build the team that's focused on this opportunity for us. I think the main takeaways, if you were to kind of step back from the 90-day period, if you will, is we expect to have democratized products across our 4 main asset classes, real estate, infrastructure, private equity and credit. This continues to be a real priority for us, and the great news for us, one, this is a huge end market. It's a massive opportunity. And in many ways, it's all upside for us, and it continues to feel like we're really wonderfully well positioned against this just enormous opportunity.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Gerry, it's Scott, as Rob mentioned that we continue to feel great about what we shared with you in terms of our growth plans through 2026. We had very little on private wealth in those numbers. So to Craig's point, this is all in front of us and upside for us relative to what's in the firm today. And hopefully, it will provide upside to the trajectory we shared with you at our Analyst Day amongst other quarterly calls.
Operator: Our next question is with Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: Can you give us an update on the announced but not closed realizations for 4Q? And then maybe taking a step back, any updated broader thoughts on the potential for realized cash flow to come down over the next few quarters into next year given the decrease [indiscernible] and more difficulty getting deals done?
Robert Lewin: Sure. Patrick, thanks for the question. Based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have either been signed up or we expect that have closed or we expect to close this quarter, we've got approximately $350 million of realized performance revenue and realized investment revenue that we feel good about. So continued momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment. And if we achieve those numbers, and this price is important, ballpark around 30% comes from carried interest and the balance from realized investment income and incentive fees that will come in at that lower comp range. And so a higher flow-through on monetization is at least what we've got quarter-to-date. In respect of realized monetization revenue in the future, of course, some of this is going to be impacted by the environment. and I've said this before, we don't need straight line up markets when we need or periods of time where volatility is down and pockets of time where volatility is down to be able to monetize our portfolio. And while you're right, we've taken some marks as an industry and as a firm, we still have approximately $9 billion of embedded revenue that sits on the balance sheet across our carried interest outline item as well as our balance sheet. And so that's the fair value of those assets relative to their cost that gives us a good bit of visibility in terms of generating meaningful revenue in the future when we do get those pockets or opportunities to be able to monetize our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: So maybe circling back to the insurance platform. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the implications of higher interest rates as it relates to any kind of lapse or surrender dynamics and/or block opportunities.
Robert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. I'll take this or I'll start. Overall, the punchline is we think GA should be a net beneficiary of a rising rate environment for a couple of reasons, and I'll touch on surrenders at the end. One, flows should be better, both on the individual as well as on the institutional side of that business. I think on the individual side, it's just easier to be able to sell and distribute a 4% annuity than it is a 1.5% annuity.  And then on the institutional side, you referenced blocks. We should benefit here. We're seeing this in our pipeline because all things equal, our reinsurance clients are going to realize lower losses in a higher rate environment. And so I think that's why you're seeing our pipeline pick up on the block side. As it relates to the balance sheet specifically, assets and liabilities are pretty tightly matched at GA, as you know. So we don't expect much impact here, but we definitely do have some floating rate exposure. And so overall, we should be doing better on the balance sheet in a higher rate environment.  And then you mentioned surrenders at the end. It's still early, of course. But so far in 2022, as well as in Q3 of 2022, we've experienced lower surrenders than what we were expecting. If we attribute a good part of this to the design of our products, which is incentivize policyholders from surrendering before they are expected to do so. And so as you think about Global Atlantic and our policies, but 75% of those policies either have surrender charges or aren't able to be surrendered get back to product design and why we feel like we got our arms around that kind of a risk in a rising rate environment. but of course, something that we continue to watch. But the punchline is, we think in this kind of a rising rate type of environment that we're in right now, GA should be a net beneficiary.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: My question is on fundraising, the $13 billion for 3Q. Can you unpack the real asset component of the fundraising that could only get about 1/3 or so of that from the fund tables within that $6 billion in that segment. And then also if you can sort of comment on the pension plan appetite and your view on that channel given rising long-term rates.  And then just one comment on the fundraising so far year-to-date being the second best year. I imagine it's still a challenging environment near term, at least. So I just want to be sure that you're not expecting fundraising to exceed the 2021, which, of course, was a record year with flagships.
Craig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start. And I'll start on your last point first. Look, I think with market volatility, the tone of the fundraising market has become more challenging. But to be clear, we feel great about the body of work here. So as Rob noted and as you mentioned a second ago, new capital raise for the first 9 months of $65 billion, again, through 9 months, already the second most active fundraising year for in our history without a lot of flagships in the market.  And when I think back to where consensus estimates were for us at the beginning of this year, that number for 2022 for the full year was in that $55 billion to $60 billion range. So again, we've already raised more capital relative to what was expected at the outset of the year. and that's been accomplished in a more difficult fundraising environment, and we still got another quarter to go.  So look, I think, again, we feel great about everything that we've accomplished a couple of other thoughts. One, you mentioned the fundraising that we've had in some of the real assets areas. And when I think of activity for us in strategy like infrastructure, real estate and credit. So strategies that can -- or should participate in a rising rate environment or our inflation protected. That's been 2/3 of the capital that we've raised over the trailing 12 months.  And then finally, I think also in terms of innovation, over half of the capital we raised in the trailing 12 months, again, were in strategies that didn't exist within taking our 5 years ago. In real assets, one of those contributors to the quarter is a great example. So our Asia infrastructure strategy is a great example of this. It was outside of the mandate of our flagship fund series, the first generation fund. Again, we feel great about performance. And that was certainly one of the contributors to real assets in the quarter. That would have been the largest piece as it relates to the infrastructure component. And then within real estate, you had a handful of components. The largest of which would have included GA's contribution within our real estate footprint. But again, I think the main takeaway, we feel really great about everything that we've done so far this year.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, to your pension plan question, if there's no doubt some U.S. pension plans are getting their bearings right now in trying to figure out where the market is going to go. But we're having a lot of very productive conversations to Craig's point, around anything that's got an inflation protection element or yield. So within credit, infrastructure, real estate. We're having a lot of good dialogues on those fronts even with some of those that are still getting their bearings and may be more active early part of next year than the end of this year.  But remember, we're spending a lot of time with institutions we've never spent time with before. So insurance companies globally are trying to figure out how to navigate the rate environment. Sovereign wealth funds have a different dynamic entirely as do family offices and high net worth investors. So we're having more dialogue than we've ever had before about the markets in the macro and introducing what we're doing.  And I think to the bigger broader point, and you referenced this in your question, we were incredibly fortunate. We raised over $120 billion last year. Our large flagships have been in the market over the last couple of years before the more recent more challenged markets. So we really got a bit lucky with our timing, and that's why we have the $113 billion of dry powder to put to work.  In an environment like this, companies still need capital. And we find private capital tends to have less competition at a time like this. Public markets are more difficult. Corporate M&A is more challenged. So we've got a lot of capital to put to work. Companies still need it.
Operator: Our next question is with Arnaud Giblat with BNP.
Arnaud Giblat: My question is regarding capital deployment and infrastructure. You hopefully give us quite an update on private equity. I'm just wondering if you could sum in for a second on infra other key players out there have been broadly unaffected by the macro environment deploying quite quick.  I'm just wondering specifically how you see the outlook in terms of deployment in infrastructure? And should we be thinking of a similar time frame as you experienced in the past and where the opportunity set may align in front?
Craig Larson: Yes, Craig, why don't I start? Look, on the main point, there is a massive need for infrastructure capital globally. And alongside of that massive need, you're really seeing a step function change in the footprint of our business. So whether that's our Global and for fund series, Asian for fund series, diversified core AUM 2 years ago was $15 billion, and today, we're at $50 million. So alongside of that presence, you're seeing similarly a step function increase in terms of our deployment and that teams remained among the busiest within KKR. We've invested $11 billion of capital globally over the last 12 months in infrastructure. In 2020, that number was a little over $2 billion. So again, you've seen a big ramp in that activity, and that's something that I think we'd expect that you should continue to see for us.  One of our largest deployments in the quarter was in a -- it was a take private of a French renewables business. We have another take private that is announced is scheduled to close in Q4. And I think the take private dynamic is actually also something that's just worth mentioning. It's true in infrastructure. It's also true more broadly. We've announced again or we've closed on for take private this year with a fifth set to close in Q4. But again, the main takeaway on Infra is a high level of activity for us.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Arnaud, it's Scott. I'd say the punchline is consistent with your comment. Our pipeline is strong across both value-add and core infrastructure. So we've been announcing deals and we continue to have a full pipeline.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Maybe just continuing with the real asset theme there. Can you talk a little bit about how you're expanding your capacity to invest in real assets? Where are you looking to expand the platform as you look out over the next year or where are you hiring? Can you also talk about the sort of added benefit on the transactional revenue side as real asset deployment continues to come up. It looks like that was pretty strong in the quarter there as well. And then just a cleanup question for Rob, if you could just mention the investments and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter.
Scott Nuttall: You want to start with realizations?
Robert Lewin: Sure, in the quarter, Mike, thanks for the question. About $800 million of deployment and monetization, so that's a little bit north of $400 million off of the balance sheet.
Craig Larson: Why don't I start on the first part, I'll let Scott then that. Look, I think if you look at a statistic to kind of help frame the growth and the presence in the marketplace, we had $118 billion of AUM in real assets at the end of the quarter. Two years ago, that number was 30. And naturally, in the evolution of these businesses, your CapEx runs through your income statement. And so you hire people, you need to bring on world-class talent to then have the opportunity to raise capital. And then you're looking to earn your right to grow, build and scale both those funds themselves as well as where you see opportunities to expand into other areas where you can be relevant.  So I think we feel great about the progress that we've made, but our hockey sticks aren't in the air as I think we see the opportunity set ahead of us and look where the leading 1 or 2 providers are in some of those businesses, and it just feels like there's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to build and grow and scale off of all of the growth that you've already begun to see.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Just a couple of other thoughts, Mike. Thanks for the question. Just take real estate, we'll take the 2 pieces of real assets in turn. Real estate, a few things I'd call out. One is Asia. We continue to expand the team. You saw the acquisition that we completed in Japan of the platform now called KJRM. We have 160 people now in Tokyo focused on what is the second largest real estate market in the world, and that's a J-REIT platform as a reminder. So Asia would be one thing I'd call out.  We've also expanded the platform. We started an opportunistic, but we've also now expanded to core plus. And so we're raising capital across U.S., Europe and Asia core plus. So that would be a second area I'd call out. Third would be credit. Right now, we think the real estate credit opportunity is very attractive as those financing markets have become more challenged in the traditional format. We're seeing excess return and a very strong pipeline across all we do in real estate credit. That platform, as a reminder, is now approaching $30 billion of AUM, that's all on top of the regular way opportunistic funds where we remain highly thematic and we're raising capital and continuing to build the teams.  In infrastructure, similar set of themes. I'd call out again, Asia. Our Asia infrastructure platform. Rob referenced it from a fundraising standpoint, but we continue to see a lot of opportunity there and frankly, less on the ground competition, and that platform has scaled meaningfully and quite quickly. We are also building out our core infrastructure business and moving from value add into core in a bigger way. And per the discussion earlier about some of the take private, I'd say Europe would be another area that I called out. There's just a lot of activity and a lot of opportunity in particular lately on the renewable and energy transition front.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.
Rufus Hone: I was hoping to get your thoughts around the trajectory of fee-related performance revenues and a fairly big increase this quarter from the Real Assets business. Can you give us a bit more detail about how we might think about the growth of that line item looking at a year or two and perhaps if you take a normalized view on investment performance and growth of some of the democratized products?
Robert Lewin: Yes, Rufus, you hit on it there at the end. As we think about that line item in our P&., -- that is going to be largely driven by our open-ended and more perpetual vehicles that are more yield based in nature. As you would have heard a couple of times already on this call, we have a lot of conviction that we can scale that part of our business. We've got a lot of conviction that we continue to perform on behalf of that client base and as you combine those 2 things, our view as you look over the coming quarters and years, you're going to see a real ramp up in that line item over time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.
Christoph Kotowski: Yes. I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on the financing markets. I guess Twitter has done Tenneco got European approval. So the banks are, in fact, kind of perhaps have some inventory to work through. And I'm wondering if you can talk a bit about how long do you think that, that is going to be an obstacle for financing transactions in the public markets? And how much is that an obstacle for you to do pursue public to privates in general?
Craig Larson: Chris, it's Craig, why don't I start? Look, the financing markets have become more challenging, certainly relative to a year ago and 6 months ago. But again, we look at that, honestly, as an opportunity for us, and we mentioned it earlier. If you go back to 2020, we very creatively were able to find lots of ways to deploy capital in very dislocated environments. So I'm not at all trying to minimize your thoughts or points of view on the banks, et cetera. And you've seen a lot of the impacts of that in broad statistics. But when you see that the broadly syndicated market in Q3 was at its lowest level since the global financial crisis. That gives you a sense of how dislocated markets are and what that means and how things can become more challenging and financing in the broadly syndicated markets.  Now there is a flip side to that coin, obviously, as it relates to private credit. And I think we look at the environment in private credit currently, and we are very, very constructive. So when syndicated markets are challenged. And as Scott mentioned earlier, companies still need capital. That's a really interesting opportunity for us.  So base rates are higher, spreads are higher, protections are better. The risk reward just feels like it feels very attractive to us at this moment in time. And the opportunity for us in our direct lending business is not only going to be in new transactions and new deals like the ones that you referenced, but historically, around half of our deployment has traditionally come from companies where we're the incumbent lender. And in markets like these where volumes are down and there's uncertainty, that percentage is even going to be higher. So if you look more recently, that number would be at about 70%. So I think there are two sides of that coin, again, on the top of broadly.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Chris, it's Scott. Just a couple of other things. One, I use the word obstacle. I think first, it's important to understand, we think it's a real opportunity for us. So to Craig's point, private credit deployment, real estate credit deployment, we are seeing dramatically more interesting risk reward than we saw even a few months ago. I'd also point to mezzanine. We think this is going to be a really interesting opportunity for mezz. New transactions with sponsors in particular, tend to be over-equitized in this type of environment and you've got a more attractive risk reward there. Opportunistic credit fundraising. Every time the high-yield market trades below 85%, the 1-year returns tend to be in the high 20s. And so we're having really productive dialogue with investors all around the world who are looking to pivot into the leveraged credit markets on the traded side in addition to the private side.  You're right, new deals are harder to finance. It's part of the reason we built the capital markets business, and we have that team sitting in the middle of the firm that can dock directly to debt investors, so we can place our own capital structures. You may lean a bit more on the private credit market in this environment, maybe some portable capital structures. But we're finding ways to get deals done. So I think as we sit here today, we're finding ourselves incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunity that this environment represents for a large part of the firm across our credit platforms.
Operator: It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson: We'd just like to thank everybody for your time and interest in KKR, and we look forward to connecting next quarter. Thank you so much.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR’s Second Quarter 2020 [ph] Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, as usual, I’m joined by Rob Lewin, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. We’d like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future rental performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. This quarter, we’re reporting fee-related earnings per share of $0.52 and after-tax distributable earnings of $0.95. Looking at the first half of 2022 compared to 2021, we feel very good about our performance. Against a challenging market backdrop, our management fees are up 39%, fee-related earnings increased 28% and our after-tax DE increased 14%. Now, before we go into more details on our results, we’d like to highlight the changes to our business lines that we posted to our website last week and are also reflected in today’s earnings release. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the scale of our real assets business. So, we split private markets into two business lines, private equity and real assets. Our private equity business line is comprised of our traditional PE, core PE and growth strategies while real assets include real estate, infrastructure and energy. And at the same time, we’re changing the name of our public markets business line to credit and liquid strategies, a more descriptive name for the capital that we manage here. The driver of these changes is the growth and increasing significance of our real assets business. KKR today is a meaningfully more diversified firm by strategy and by geography than it was only a few years ago. To give you a sense of the growth we’ve experienced here at the end of 2019, so two and a half years ago, real assets AUM was $28 billion. Today, that number is $114 million. So it’s over four times the size today compared to just two and a half years ago, and the drivers of this growth are several. At the end of 2019, infrastructure AUM was $15 billion, driven by the scaling of our flagship fund together with our expansion into adjacencies like Asia and core infra, AUM today is almost $50 billion. Within real estate, AUM has increased from $9 million at the end of 2019 to over $60 billion today, and that’s pretty evenly split between real estate equity and real estate credit. Our opportunistic equity strategies have been scaling. We now have core plus [ph] strategies across the Americas, Europe and Asia. We acquired the Japanese REIT business earlier this year, and that’s all alongside a meaningful increase in the breadth of our real estate credit platform driven by Global Atlantic. And in energy, our strategic positioning has improved through our ownership interest in Crescent Energy, while AUM has increased to almost $4 billion. Page 9 of the earnings release helps profile is increasing significant more visually. So the bars that you see on this page in total reflect to what we previously referred to as private markets. And you see each of the bars broken into their private equity and real assets components. So alongside of the AUM growth we just ran through, you’re beginning to see a meaningful increase in real asset management fees and deployment. And at the same time, private equity strategies have been scaling. AUM increased from $92 billion at the end of 2019 to $172 billion [ph] today, driven by the continued growth of our flagship private equity funds alongside the scaling of core private equity and our growth strategies. When you look at the private equity figures for June 30, 2022, and compare those to 2019, AUM, management fees and capital invested have all been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 30%. Now turning to the quarter itself in our key operating metrics. Assets under management came in at $491 billion. That’s up 14% year-over-year, while fee-paying AUM increased to $384 billion, up 20% compared to last year. This growth is driven by our continued fundraising momentum with $25 billion of new capital raised in Q2 and $52 billion for the first half of the year. In terms of fundraising for the quarter, we’d highlight four things. First, really building on what we just ran through a few moments ago, is the increasing significance of real assets as fundraising across infrastructure and real estate contributed over 40% of new capital raised in the quarter. Of particular note, we closed on over $4 billion of capital for our Asia Infrastructure strategy. Second, we closed on a new $5 billion multi-asset class strategic partnership in the quarter. The broad framework of this partnership is similar to those we’ve talked about with you before. It’s long-dated in nature with recycling provisions. And with around $2 billion recently committed, the net impact on new capital raised in Q2 was approximately $3 billion. This helps bring our total strategic and perpetual capital to $232 billion or 44% of our fee-paying AUM. Third is Global Atlantic. It’s been a good environment for organic activity at GA as new capital raised in the quarter totaled approximately $6 billion. This is seen in both our credit and real assets business lines. And finally, the fourth point is really the breadth of activity that we’re seeing across the credit business. In addition to GA, we were active in the CLO markets in the U.S. and Europe and the private credit markets. And of note here, in Q2, we held the final closing of our Asia Credit Fund. And early in Q3, we announced the final close of our asset-based finance firm. Now alongside of our capital raising, we also continue to find compelling opportunities in which to invest. We deployed $19 billion in the quarter and over $40 billion year-to-date. Again, one of the key drivers of our activity in the quarter was our real assets business with $8 billion of capital invested. Within Infrastructure, core infra was most active deploying across the U.S. and Europe, real estate credit, including Global Atlantic and KREF totaled $4 billion. Real estate equity investment was concentrated in the Americas, really on both the opportunistic and core plus fronts and private equity accounted for $6 billion in the quarter, driven by activity in the U.S. In credit, deployment of $5 billion was driven by GA-related private credit activity. And importantly, at the end of the quarter, we had $115 billion of dry powder ready to deploy into new opportunities. Now before turning it over to Rob, we want to spend a few minutes on a piece of KKR that permeates everything that we do, and that’s ESG. So two things here. First, in June, we published our 11th annual Sustainability Report. The report this year titled scaling up outlines how we’ve been scaling efforts to manage ESG issues across our investment portfolio as well as our global operations. This year marked a significant expansion of the scope of our ESG reporting, which builds on our history of transparency. We hope you’ll take time to go through the report in more detail. And on the back of that, we want to drill down and spend a few minutes on the S in ESG, the social component. This is really important to us. And one spot where we’ve shown real leadership and we’re going to walk through now is our work around broad employee ownership in our portfolio of companies. And we plan to share more stories like this with you in the future. Many of you will recall Pete Stavros’ presentation on C.H.I Overhead Doors at our 2018 Investor Day. We were the fourth private equity owner of the business. It’s across to our manufacturing business and EBITDA margins at that time were already top quartile for building products company at 21%. Now one of the things that our team saw was an opportunity to engage with this workforce in a way that hadn’t been done before. And so began our seven-year journey. We introduced a broad-based equity program at the outset of our investment, so all 800 employees, largely hourly workers, received an ownership interest in the company and we continue to invest in the employee base along the way. And by partnering with the workforce, operational improvements were seen at every level. Injury rates declined meaningfully, employee engagement increased meaningfully and product quality improved. So in total, revenues more than doubled over our ownership and EBITDA more than tripled as EBITDA margins increased from 21% to 35%, all organic. So it was a very successful investment for us. It was a 10x multiple of money transactions for our clients. And through the broad-based equity program, it was also a very successful investment for the employees of C.H.I. On average, the warehouse and factory workers each made $175,000 on the sale and the most tenured workers made approximately $800,000. So they are in multiples of their annual salary through the sale. And now just this morning, we’re pleased to have announced the sale of Minnesota Rubber and Plastics or MRP. Like C.H.I, we introduced a broad-based equity ownership program across all of MRP employees, including many hourly workers when we acquired MRP in 2018. Over 1,300 non-management employees across six countries and four states. In the company and it employs it performs, we’ve seen significant improvements in safety, waste reduction, the speed of new product delivery and earnings growth as EBITDA margins grew from 21% to 25% over our ownership. So again, this will be a strong investment for our fund investors. We expect the sale to be a 3x multiple of our cost in approximately three and a half years. And at the same time, we think it’s a great event for MRP’s employees. On average, employees will receive 100% of their annual income and equity payouts from the sale with the more tenured employees receiving 200% of their annual income. And now we want to turn these experiences into a movement. We’ve implemented broad-based employee ownership programs across many of our traditional PE and impact investments over 25 to-date. We’ve touched over 50,000 employees, and that number is going to grow meaningfully from here. In addition, we have found a new nonprofit called Ownership Works to support public and private companies that are transitioning to shared ownership models like the ones we implemented at C.H.I and MRP. At this time, Ownership Works includes over 60 member firms pursuing this mission. We think part of creating a movement will be storytelling, which is why we walked through the C.H.I and MRP examples, and we look forward to having many additional stories to review with you in the quarters and years ahead. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. First, to go through our quarterly P&L. Our management fees came in at $655 million. That’s up 36% compared to the second quarter of 2021. To put that into context, Q2 of 2021 already reflected a full quarter of Global Atlantic management fees. So the 35% plus growth really reflects the organic momentum that we have across the firm today. Net transaction and monitoring fees were $107 million for the quarter. The decrease here was driven by our capital markets business, which I will spend a bit of time on shortly. As it relates to our expenses, our fee-related comp margin consistent with prior quarters, was 22.5%. Operating expenses totaled $137 million. This increase was driven by a few things, including a heightened level of activity in corporate travel and office operations as well as continued investments in both our technology build-out and marketing organization. This is all critical investment that we feel is setting us up for future growth and is very consistent with our plans for the year. Bringing it all together, our fee-related earnings totaled $461 million or $0.52 per share this quarter. Moving to our realization related revenue, which was very positive for us this quarter, and in aggregate, represented one of our highest in the firm’s history. Realized performance income came in at $731 million. Our carried interest was driven by monetization of internet brands, a number of public market exits and the sales of opportunistic real estate assets. Realized investment income totaled $277 million, driven by these same transactions. In total, our asset management operating earnings were just over $950 million. Our Insurance segment also had a very strong quarter, generating $137 million of operating earnings. Together, these earnings streams resulting in after-tax DE of $840 million or $0.95 per share. Year-to-date, our after-tax DE was over $1.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, which I think highlights the continued strength of our business model. Taking a step back from the quarterly numbers, the momentum across the firm continues to be exceptionally strong. And there is high confidence that we’re doing the things that we need to do really across the board to set ourselves up for the future. We have had continued fundraising success with $52 billion of new capital raised year-to-date. We are on our way to reaching our goal of being top three in everything that we do. And with 65% of that new capital coming into our real assets and credit businesses we’re becoming a meaningfully more diversified asset management firm. Management fees in turn, are up 39% for the first half of 2022 and with $44 billion of AUM that will become fee-paying when it enters its investment period, we have a good line of sight on future management fee growth. The quality of our investment portfolio is evidenced by our relative investment performance, as well as our ability to monetize these investments through the cycle. Realized gains for KKR are up in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. Though we had a lighter quarter in capital markets, fees for the first half of 2022 are approximately $340 million, very solid against what has clearly been a challenged market backdrop since the beginning of the year. We remain really excited about the potential for our capital markets business. We have a unique business model and an ability to recruit and retain best-in-class talent. Additionally, we have $25 billion of total cash and investments on our balance sheet. Last quarter on this call, we spent a lot of time detailing the strength of both our investment portfolio as well as the unique nature of our long-dated and fixed liabilities. We have no doubt that our position here represents a real competitive advantage, especially in a more volatile market environment, and it will allow for us to emerge from this period in an even stronger position. Turning to our investment performance. The traditional private equity business was down 7% in the quarter compared to broad indices that were down over 16%. And over the last 12 months, the portfolio was up 4%, while the MSCI World was down 14%. Importantly, inception-to-date IRRs for the key flagship returns across geographies remains strong at 32%, 19% and 38% across our Americas, Europe and Asia portfolio companies. Similarly, opportunistic real estate was up 1% in the quarter and over the last 12 months, up 23%. With infrastructure down 1% and up 8% over the last 12 months. On the leveraged credit side, the portfolio was down 6% for the quarter and down 5% for the last 12 months. Our alternative credit portfolio was down 1% in Q2 and up 6% in the LTM. Next, to go through our balance sheet. Investment performance was down 5% in the quarter and up 1% over the last 12 months. We spent time last quarter reviewing the core private equity portfolio. Core PE remains the largest allocation on our balance sheet today. Over 30% of our investments are in the strategy. For Q2, this portfolio was down 2.5%, but up 16% over the last 12 months. The underlying fundamentals of the core PE portfolio remain resilient, with organic revenue and EBITDA up approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, through the first half of 2022. Turning a minute to focus on our Asia franchise. With the closing of our acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager KJRM, the growth in our Asia Infra strategy and our first Asia private credit fund, we continue to feel that we have a really differentiated position in a critical geography. Our Asia-focused capital has increased threefold since the end of 2019, now reaching $59 billion. Most recently, we have raised over $4 billion of capital so far for our Asia infrastructure strategy, making the capital raised already larger than its predecessor, which at $3.8 billion was previously the largest infra fund in the region. We now clearly have the number one franchise in a space that is a tremendous addressable market and real secular tailwinds. As a result of all of this activity, the moat that we have created around our Asia business continues to expand. Finally, I want to take a minute just to review our long-term financial goals. As we have stated on the last few calls, we expect our FRE to be $4-plus per share and our after-tax distributable earnings to be over $7 per share by 2026. These goals have not changed. And we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our targets. Relative to what we are all reading right now in many corporate headlines, KKR is in a really unique position where we have both the P&L and the business momentum to be able to continue investing back into our business for growth. It’s one of the many reasons that we are all so excited about the long-term potential. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call this morning. A few weeks ago, we hosted a conference for our global private equity and real asset clients. People from around the world came and spent three days with us at our first in-person event like this since 2019. I thought today, I’d share a handful of key takeaways from the event. First, as a whole, investment performance has never been stronger across the firm. This is a quarterly earnings call. So the discussion on investment performance tends to be focused on the last 90 days. But when you take a step back and look at inception to date IRRs across our key funds, we’ve been delivering differentiated absolute and relative performance for our clients. Second, we’ve talked a great deal on these calls about how we’re highly thematic in our investment approach. This was evident in all of the presentations. We think we got the macro right. And with volatility expected to continue and a more challenging economic environment ahead of us, it will be critical for us to continue to be on the right side of key macro trends and highly connected across the firm. Third, we’ve been balanced investors. As just one example, across our traditional PE funds over the last 12 months, we’ve returned more capital than we deployed. This is in contrast to perception and has helped us in the fundraising numbers that you’ve been seeing. Fourth, our newer businesses are off to a fantastic start. Over the last five years, we’ve launched a series of adjacencies that are early in their life cycle. You’re seeing innovation across our firm. And in our experience, it takes 10 years for businesses to scale and inflect in a way that can move the needle. So there continues to be a great deal of growth ahead of us. And finally, our people. We have never felt better about the talent in the firm. It was fun to be able to show up our deep bench at the conference. As we listen to three days of presentations and discussions, it becomes apparent, we have a unified team that is focused on generating exceptional outcomes. Our numbers speak to the strength, quality and resiliency, not only of our model, but of our most important asset, our people. As we step back from the conference and the markets for a minute, while there’s no doubt the operating environment has shifted compared to six months ago, we are not overly concerned with near-term volatility or the business cycle. In fact, nothing has changed about the path we are on. With record dry powder, multiple scaling businesses, a large and liquid balance sheet and further innovation and expansion underway, our confidence level is high. And we find it as exactly times like this when we make some of our best investments and strategic moves. So, our outlook has not changed, and we are focused on capitalizing on the opportunity any short-term market behavior gives us to create even greater long-term value for all of us. With that, we’re happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question then is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody, thanks for the question. Question on deployment and a bit of a multipart, I guess, but all related. So the $44 billion of committed capital, they’ll turn on fees once deployed. Can you help break down, which businesses these balances sit within? And how are you thinking about the pace and timing of deploying this capital over the next over the next 12 months or so? What it means for management fees and transaction fees is kind of part of that? And I guess when you take a little bit of a step back, we’ve seen a pretty meaningful decline in sponsor-backed announcements in the space over the last month or two. To what extent is sort of tighter financial conditions do you think could weigh on KKR’s ability to deploy capital?
Rob Lewin: Good morning, Alex, it’s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. When you look at the $44 billion of capital, that’s up, I think, $8 billion quarter-over-quarter from last quarter, blended management fee rate on that is just north of 1%, at 1.04%. And it’s spread pretty nicely across our three asset management businesses. And so in our private equity business, our core private equity business would be reflected in that number across real assets. You see our Asia Infrastructure strategy where so far, we’ve raised over $4 billion of capital, as Craig noted, that has not yet turned on, so it would be in that $44 billion figure. And then our credit business, most of our credit business, the closed-end funds are going to be turned on when that capital gets invested. And so it’s spread nicely across our three asset management businesses.
Craig Larson: And then Alex, it’s Craig. Maybe just on point two. Look, I think as it relates to deployment, it’s interesting. A couple of things. One, just on the stacks. private equity and real assets deployment in the first half of the year was $27 billion. That’s up from 12% in the first half of last year. So, when you look broadly in terms of overall level of activity, you’ve actually seen a healthy amount of activity. Now your point on the state of the credit markets, though, is certainly a fair one. I think we’re seeing a couple of dynamics there. Announced M&A as a whole is down. So, I think when you look at new issuance, you’re seeing that, that overall new issuance number is down. I think banks to us are feeling more cautious. So, I think when you’re seeing both of those things reflected in terms of overall levels of activity in the private credit markets. But I think importantly, markets are open and functioning and we still have the ability to finance transactions. We’re not at a point where our ability to finance transactions is impacting our ability to get things done.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank. Good morning everyone.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Craig Siegenthaler: I had a question on private equity performance. And I know it’s just 90 days. But inside of the 7% mark for corporate Private equity, do you have the breakout of public versus private in the quarter? And also, do you have any color on the main funds like Americas XII, Next Gen 2? Thank you very much.
Rob Lewin: Hey Craig, good morning, it’s Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Certainly, what you would have seen in the quarter is that our publics were down more than our privates. In part, that was impacted by an M&A trade where on one of our privates strategic trade that resulted in a north of $1 billion write-up on our private portfolio. I think you’re right, when you said it is only a 90-day period. I think that’s important to put into context. We feel really good about how we valued our book this quarter. We spent a lot of time on it. Of course, we’ve got a mix about DCF and comparable companies that are going to flow through and impact our marks. I do think it’s important, though, to think about coming into 2022 where our private equity performance was. And in 2019, we generated a 27% return for our investors. That was 17% in 2020 and 46% in 2021. So we came into this period of volatility with a lot of embedded gains. If you invested $1 with us, there’s a lot of ins and outs of course, but just on those returns alone. In 2019, it would still be worth close to $2 today with some of the marks that we’ve taken in Q2.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. I think the only thing I’d add Craig, fundamentally, the companies are continuing to perform well. So I think you’re largely seeing some multiple contraction this quarter. But in terms of the underlying fundamental performance of the portfolio continues to be strong.
Operator: Thank you very much. The next question is from Gerry O’Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Scott Nuttall: Hey Gerry, are you there? We can’t hear you.
Operator: Gerry, your line is open. Would you like to ask…
Gerry O’Hara: How about now? Can you hear me all right?
Scott Nuttall: There we go. Hey Gerry.
Gerry O’Hara: Okay. Thanks. Just actually hoping to get a little bit of an update on capital management. And it looks like just during the quarter, there wasn’t any incremental buybacks or at least from the period from May 1 onward, just kind of hope we might get a little bit of an update how you’re thinking about that and potentially how we should think about it going forward.
Rob Lewin: Hey Gerry, thanks for the question. Like most things, I think in our business, probably looking quarter-to-quarter is a little bit less relevant than looking over time. And since we initiated our buyback program several years ago, we’ve bought back or canceled approximately 85 million shares. I think that’s done, give or take, around $25 per share, which is a little bit lower than our book value today. And so when we look back at our body of work over the last several years, we feel good. In addition to that, if you look at Q2 in isolation, we had also completed the acquisition of KJRM, almost $2 billion and issued no equity as part of that. And so as we think about capital allocation and buybacks, what we are most focused on as a management team is ensuring that we drive the highest level of profitability on a per share basis, and there’s multiple ways of being able to get there. And ultimately, if we’re moving our capital around in a way that maximizes ROE, and we think that’s a real core competency of ours. Then ultimately, we will drive long-term best performance from a profitability on a per share basis. Our expectation is share buybacks are going to continue to be a part of that as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you very much. And the next question is from Brian Mckenna of JMP. Please go ahead.
Brian Mckenna: Thanks. Good morning everyone. So if I look at net realized performance income prior to 2021, it was running at about $1 billion annually for a few years despite varying operating backdrops, and then as the business scale that essentially doubled the $2 billion plus in 2021, and based on results in the first half of this year, you’re still run rating at about $2 billion. So is this $2 billion run rate level of reasonable expectation moving forward, despite the more challenging backdrop or if the volatility persists, do you think you’ll trend back towards the prior $1 billion level? Just trying to get some additional perspective here, on the baseline level of realizations moving forward.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. And so we’re probably going to stay away from providing levels of forward guidance, certainly on things like realization. I think what we will say though is that we’ve been really proud of our ability to be able to monetize through the first half of this year in a highly volatile environment. I think that speaks to a couple of things. Scott touched on the strength of our underlying portfolio. And no doubt, without real strong performance in our portfolio, we wouldn’t have been able to achieve those exits. It also speaks to the diversification of our business model. And what we have talked about over time is a real scaling of our capital that is eligible for carry as well as our deployment. And as a result of that, our expectation over time is you’re going to see our carried interest and realized performance income scaling over time and we think can be pretty significant scaling as we move out a number of years and some of our newer funds that are much larger start to get to scale and are maturing. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Patrick Davitt: Hi, good morning everyone. It looks like the mark-to-market on the fee paying side of the AUM rolled forward was significantly worse than most people expected. So could you flush out kind of some of the key drivers in the negative marks on the fee-paying AUM side, maybe by strategy and/or vehicle? And in that vein, it looks like management fees actually came in more or less in line. So is it fair to assume that the fee rate on the more negatively marked AUM was dramatically lower than the inflows.
Rob Lewin: Patrick, you hit it perfectly. So the majority of that change in value is a result in really interest rates going up in the fixed income portfolio at Global Atlantic trading down. And so that’s what’s driving it. And as you think about our fee rate on the Global Atlantic pool of capital that’s materially lower than the rest of our business. And so that’s why you end up in a scenario where our management fees are pretty disproportional to what you see in terms of the change in value on our fee-paying assets.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Arnaud Giblat of BNP. Please go ahead.
Arnaud Giblat: Hi, good morning. My question is on secondaries. Could you discuss your view on the outlook [ph] for secondary funds at this point in the cycle? And how you’re thinking about positioning there and gaining exposure either organically or inorganically? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Yes. And so we have no – thanks a lot for the question. We have nothing that’s imminent to report as it relates to secondaries, whether that’s organic or inorganic. It’s a space that we continue to look at with interest. It is certainly adjacent to our core private equity strategies across the firm. And so it’s one that we’re spending time on. I think what’s important to note is we’ve talked about our goals, our financial measures that we expect to achieve over the next four to five years generating $4-plus of FRE. That’s based on principally things that KKR is doing today. Doesn’t rely on any inorganic activity. And so while we’ll continue to look at the space, and spend time on it. There’s a lot of areas that we’re focused on KKR that are in front of us that we’ve started where we have track records, and we’ve got a lot of opportunity to scale this.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to focus on the real assets segmentation and more strategically and how you’re thinking about it. I guess a two partner first, are you – you’ve already built this business, obviously, hence this, the – reason for or justification for segmenting it out, but is there also a change in management focus in focusing on this area disproportionately going forward? And then the second part of that is on the infrastructure side. Can you talk about your view on energy transition? I don’t know if that would fit into an infrastructure strategy or whether you would consider over the long-term raising an energy transition fund. And maybe just your views long-term in that area given that you’ve got a lot of focus on real assets broadly in general.
Craig Larson: Hey Brian, it’s Craig. Why don’t I start? I’m sure on the overarching question you’re asking, Scott will add. Look, I think in terms of the two businesses, you mentioned in infrastructure, you’re right, we have seen really dramatic scaling in both of those businesses. If you go back to our Investor Day in April of last year, we walked through infrastructure as a case study of how honestly; we look to build investment platforms. Begin with strong performance of flagship strategies and then look to scale and innovate at the same time. And that innovation can come geographically as a big with Asia infra, and it also could come in terms of expansion into new risk/reward as we’ve seen also with core infra. So we have, at this point, three distinct market segments in Infra. We’ve got the global infra funds series, Asia diversified core. It’s interesting at that Investor Day again a little over a year ago. We gave some goals or targets we set out. AUM at that point was $17 billion. We estimated that Infra AUM at the end of this year would exceed $30 billion. We’re in the high 50s now. So we’ve obviously had a lot of success there, all organic. We talked to management fees doubling from $150 to about $300 for 2022. Through the first six months, we’re at $170. So we’re comfortably on our way to exceeding that target. And in terms of real estate, really from a blank – beginning with a bank like late in 2013, the platform has grown into a powerful, fully integrated platform $60 billion of AUM today split pretty equally between debt and equity. We have over a dozen vehicles with independent economics. So I think when we look at how we’re situated and the opportunities for continued growth, on top of that, we feel great about how we’re positioned. And then you’re right, as it relates to the opportunities that we have to continue to grow and invest in a lot of the areas of ESG. I think to date, you’ve seen that both through our impact strategy. You’ve also seen that through our infrastructure strategy. So nothing new to report on that as it relates to how we think about renewals or a dedicated strategy along those lines, nothing to report today. But I think you’ll continue to see that as a real focus of ours. It’s absolutely one of the six or seven core themes that we’re pursuing on a global basis.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Brian, just in terms of your question on the strategic focus, is there any change? The answer is no. I think it was really just recognition that these businesses had scaled both infrastructure and real estate were efforts that we started post financial crisis. And we’ve been in business building mode. We continue to be. But we found that there was a time a bit of a misunderstanding under the private markets prior segmentation. There is periodically a presumption that, that was mostly Private equity. And that’s just not the case, as you can see in the chart. Just to give you a sense for the numbers. We deployed about $40 billion in the first half of this year. real assets was $17 billion of the $40 billion; credit was $13 million; and private equity was $10 million. So to the – partially pick up the prior question on the deal environment, private equity has been sub-25% of our deployment over the last 12 months, give or take, and real assets just as a larger and larger part of our firm. So we thought it was time to break it out and share it with you more explicitly going forward, but no change in focus.
Operator: Thank you sir. The next question is from Finian O’Shea of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Finian O’Shea: Hi, good morning. A question on BDCs, one of your peers lowered its fee pretty meaningfully this morning, seeing if you have any initial take on what that might mean for the product line? And maybe if this is more of a first mover or just a one-off for that group? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey Fin, it’s Craig. Thanks for the question. FSK is obviously a publicly-traded entity. It got its own management team, its own shareholders, its own board. So really, it’s probably a better question for their upcoming earnings call and not ours. Just in terms of FSK, broadly, we’re really pleased with the performance of the business and the progress that we’ve seen over the last couple of years. But in terms of your specific question on fee structure, we point you to FSK.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk about retail on the private wealth side. Hoping you could just update us on some of the initiatives there that you have on the retail side. How much was raised in the quarter? Maybe where that, sits from an AUM standpoint today and more broadly on retail, talk about some of the distribution initiatives in the private wealth channel, including around the KREST product and platform expansion. And just a quickie for a cleanup question for Rob at the end, just around the amount of capital raised and monetized off the balance sheet in the quarter. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thanks Mike. So why don’t I begin? Just first, as it relates to overall AUM, we have about $70 billion in total. That’s in three buckets. That includes funds and strategies that we market through channels. That also includes the efforts of our own team that is focused on direct sales and activities with wealth and private wealth and high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals. And then that also includes the democratized piece that you’re mentioning, which was a hair below $6 billion as of June 30. In terms of the update on the democratized front, so first on KREST. So reminder on KREST, we began taking third-party capital in June of 2021. As of June 2022, it was $1.3 billion. It crossed that $1 billion threshold earlier this year, obviously. We believe that’s the fastest that any private REIT has crossed that threshold. Performance has been very strong. Net annualized returns net north of 20%. And the distribution footprint is growing, which is great to see. So as I know you will be well aware, in particular, there are three main wire houses in the U.S. KREST has been on e of those since launch. It was onboarded at a second quite recently within the last week, actually, and it’s scheduled to be launched on the third in the coming weeks. So also in Q3 and these are important milestones for us with the wire houses. And at the same time, we’re focused on expanding distribution. That’s true as it relates to the RIA and broker-dealer channels domestically as well as the private wealth channels internationally. So we feel great about the long-term path that KREST is on, the performance that’s delivered and the opportunity ahead of us. And then as it relates again to the – just your questions on democratize where we are holistically. Again, AUM in total was 5.7% a year ago. It was at 3.5%. We’ve been hiring distribution talent and we expect to continue to do so as we think about broadening distribution of these products. And then finally, you’re going to see more innovation here. So we expect over the coming two or three quarters, we’ll have launched democratized, infrastructure and private equity strategies, and we expect to see those launched quite broadly, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So I think to date, these democratized products have really been focused in real estate and credit. And it feels to us like there’s real interest in expanding those opportunities into additional asset classes like Infra and PE, where honestly, there’s a lot more white space for us. So I think with our track record, our ability to innovate the brand, how we’re positioned, it just feels like we’re really well positioned.
Rob Lewin: And then my quick follow-up in the quarter, we had realizations of about $400 million off the balance sheet, deployment of about $800 million, and that $800 million does not include the roughly $1.7 billion that went into the KJRM acquisition.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rufus Hone: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the fund performance in traditional Private equity. Could you give us a little more detail around the fundamental performance of the portfolio companies, you gave us some helpful metrics related to the core PE book. And I was wondering, how that was tracking relative to the core book. And could you also update us on the marks in growth equity this quarter? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Sure. And Rufus, you cut out on the second part there. So I’ll let you repeat that or actually, if you could repeat that in a second. So it was private equity portfolio. And then what was the second part?
Rufus Hone: It was around the marks in growth equity this quarter. If you could provide us any detail, that would be great. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Got it. First, as it relates to the revenue and EBITDA trends I think as Scott noted at the outset, we’ve been really well situated given the focus we have and the themes that we’ve invested behind. So the underlying performance of the portfolio of companies continues to be quite strong. So we’re in – looking back historically and we look at this on a fair value weighted basis, the revenue and EBITDA growth that we’ve seen in the private equity portfolio is in double digits on a trailing 12-month basis. So we’ve been really pleased with the resiliency that you’ve been seeing in terms of the underlying private equity portfolio. And then as it relates to the growth strategies that we’ve seen in performance this quarter, again, recognizing that the S&P and MSCI were down 16% in the quarter, our next-gen tech portfolio was down in the low double digits. Healthcare was actually up honestly in the quarter. So I think in the quarter, a really volatile period, we feel good about that overall performance and in particular, feel very good about the performance and the experience that our LPs have had on an inception-to-date basis.
Operator: Thank you very much sir. The next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. I thought Craig’s discussion of the equity participation was interesting. But both of the examples you listed were kind of traditional Midwestern industrial companies. And so I’m wondering that kind of deep equity participation is that a strategy that you kind of pursue across the board in all your transactions, whether it’s Private equity, Energy, Health Care or – do certain industries lend themselves to this kind of deep broad participation and others don’t? And just kind of curious, how you think about employing that strategy strategically.
Scott Nuttall: It’s a great question, Chris. It’s Scott. And astute, so you’re right. We actually started piloting this program with our U.S. industrials private equity investments. And this was a bit over 10 years ago that we started this effort. And so some of what you’re seeing is some of those early investments now being exited, which is why you got C.H.I and MRP as the two examples that have happened in the very recent past. What we have done though is now that we’ve kind of developed this strategy as we are rolling this out across all of our control investments. In private equity starting in North America, and we’re actually looking at it now for Europe and potentially Asia as well. So it was piloted there, and we’re now expanding across everything that we do that’s control. So there’ll be more to come on this, but we’ve been really pleased with the results. And we think this effort is applicable across industries and geographies.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Please go ahead.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I’ll actually have a little bit of a multi-parter. So the first one is maybe, Rob, if you could update us on where things stand this quarter so far as you’re thinking as you’re looking ahead for realization activity? And then second question on – really on the insurance business. Could you give us a sense of kind of global land contribution to flows, organic growth this quarter, kind of how that business should be a very good environment for obviously, annuity sales and maybe update us on the momentum of that business and with that kind of current spread expectations?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Rob, I’ll take both of those. And so on the monetization point, another positive area for us this quarter, and I think continues to show the momentum. So as we sit here today, based on transactions that have happened or where we have deals that have been signed up and we expect to close this quarter, we have visibility to around $500 million of monetization related revenue. So again, some pretty good momentum on the monetization front in spite of the environment that we’re in. And if we achieve those numbers, ballpark will be about 75% realized performance revenue and the balance from realized investment income. As it relates to Global Atlantic, you are right, in a rising rate environment. I think we see a little bit more momentum certainly in the individual channel from a sales perspective. And flows this quarter were really strong. They were about $6 billion of total inflows in the quarter, which is a great quarter for GA. Again, there’s no block activity in that number. And the spread, give or take, around 100 basis points in the business. And so we’re feeling really good about how GA is positioned going into this period of time and their relationships across the bank and broker-dealer channel I think have served them really well and to take advantage of what is quite an apply environment in terms of annuity sales.
Robert Lee: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is a follow-up from Brian McKenna [JMP Securities]. Please go ahead.
Brian Mckenna: Great. Thanks for the follow up. Just on the quarter-to-date realizations, how much of that $500 million is tied to the C.H.I transaction. And it might be a little early for this, but how has Marshall Wace been performing year-to-date? Just trying to think through what that incentive fee might look like in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks, Brian. And so we’re not going to give specific numbers on individual deals as it relates to the Q3 monetization. I think the punchline is we feel pretty good across the board in terms of our ability to generate monetization outcomes at least so far this year. And you’ve seen that in Q1 and Q2, and we’re off to a good start in Q3. As it relates to Marshall Wace, maybe just take a step back, we feel great about that partnership. They’re north of $60 billion of AUM today, when we started that partnership. That business was right around $20 billion of AUM maybe a touch below. So they’ve done just a phenomenal job on behalf of their clients and have grown considerably as a result. Again, year-to-date, they’ve got a bunch of different strategies. But overall, the performance has been strong. It’s been on the positive side. We’ll see how things wrap up between now and the end of September. As you know, that will dictate their annual incentive fee for most of what they do. And so as we sit here today, they’re in positive territory, certainly not quite like last year, but we feel overall, just great about that partnership so far.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Rufus Hone [BMO Capital Markets]. Please go ahead.
Rufus Hone: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I wanted to come back to your earlier comments around returning more capital to LPs than you’ve deployed, and that’s helping conversations in Private equity. And I was wondering whether you’ve seen any change in LP appetite for core Private equity, and how do you view the outlook for deployment there? thank you.
Craig Larson: So I think we feel – and Rufus, thanks. I think on core, we’re just really thrilled with how the business is positioned. The opportunities for us, as we think about our trajectory going forward. Now just to give you a sense, two years ago, AUM was $12 billion as of June 30, that number is 32%. And you’re going to see that through our balance sheet. You’ll see that through the management fee line. Over time, with continued performance, you’ll see that in investment income. And again, you’re going to see that over time as it relates to capital markets. So we have a number of ways to win, which is exciting for us. That business is global. So I think it’s just – it continues to feel like the business is wonderfully well positioned. On the deployment outlook, again, we’re in a choppy environment. So we’ll have to see the willing buyer, willing seller dynamic, certainly, but as we think about the long-term trajectory and opportunity for us, just feel exceptionally and uniquely well positioned.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Just a quick follow-up there, Rufus. So of our $115 billion of dry powder, approximately $13 billion of that is in core Private equity. So we came into this period of time with a lot of firepower in that part of our business. And as Craig said, we feel pretty advantaged. And as we think about owning businesses in that part of our business for a 10- to 15-year period of time, gives you just a different lens in being able to evaluate acquisition opportunities and some of the things that might matter more than a three- to five- to seven-year investment might matter a little bit less when your hold period for that duration of time. So we would continue to expect there to be a real deployment across that business over the next several quarters.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Just more broadly, as a reminder, Rufus, as we came into this period of time in a really fortunate position around PE broadly, that we had raised the vast, vast majority of the capital for our flagship private equity funds before this year started, including the vast bulk of the capital for our core strategy. So while investors maybe take a little bit of time to get their bearings on PE in particular, that’s not really impacting much what we’re seeing in terms of PE fund raise. The vast majority of capital we’re raising right now is around credit and real assets where we continue to see a good amount of interest.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn, the call back to Craig Larson for some closing comments.
Craig Larson: Chris thanks for your help and thank you everybody for joining us. We really appreciate the time and attention on our quarterly results. And if we don’t speak with you in between, I look forward to chatting with everybody next quarter. Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co. Chief Executive Officer; and Rob Lewin, our CFO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com and as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted-share basis. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements. So we're pleased to be reporting strong results this morning. Fee-related earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.69, up 66% year-over-year and as high a quarterly figure as we've ever reported and after-tax DE per share came in at $1.10, that's up almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and is the second highest quarterly figure we reported. And when you look at the quarter, our results and our activities you're seeing really four things. First, you're seeing the strength and resiliency of our model, as well as our people. Despite all of the volatility and uncertainty, we reported strong results pretty much across every metric. Second, as businesses inside KKR are growing and scaling, they're inflecting and they're having a real impact on our numbers. In private markets, for example, our infrastructure and our real estate platforms of scale, so our real asset strategies comprised over half of both our fundraising and our deployment over the last 12 months. Third, we're finding creative ways to enhance our strategic positioning. Last week we closed on the previously announced acquisition of a Japanese REIT business. It's one of the largest real estate platforms in the second largest real estate market in the world. And finally, despite the volatility and increased uncertainty, our limited partners are continuing to entrust us with their capital. Strong investment performance has been a critical driver of all of the success that we've had here. Now looking at a few topics in more detail, let's begin with fundraising. New capital raised in Q1 totalled $26 billion and $132 billion over the last 12 months. Of note in private markets, both our Global Infrastructure IV fund and North America Fund XIII held final closes in the first quarter. Including employee commitments, Infrastructure IV totalled $17 billion, that's over two times larger than Infra III and North America XIII closed out at $19 billion over 35% larger than its predecessor. Also we're continuing to raise capital for our European private equity strategy. At this point, we are at $7.1 billion already surpassing in size, the prior European PE vintage, and it's worth highlighting the regional approach we've taken in our traditional private equity business with individual funds across the Americas, Asia and Europe, instead of having a single global fund. We think this allows us to maximize our fundraising potential. Committed capital across our three regional private equity funds currently exceeds $40 billion, and we're still raising capital for our European PE strategy. At the same time, it allows us to diversify our carry pools, reduces our vintage risk across these funds and importantly, we're less susceptible to the tone of the fundraising environment at a single point in time. And at public markets, $9 billion of new capital raise is among the highest quarterly figures we've reported. Activity here was widespread, including hedge funds and credit. In alternative credit, we raised capital across our asset-based finance, Asia credit and direct lending strategies, private credit strategies in Europe and the next vintage of our opportunistic strategy. And in leverage credit, we saw activity across a number of separately managed accounts and loan strategies, in addition to our CLO business, where we issued our 41st US CLO in the quarter. Global Atlantic closed on a block transaction in the quarter, which contributed $3 billion. This is reflected in both private and public markets and so these fundraising efforts helped bring AUM to $479 billion and fee paying AUM to $371 billion, both up approximately 30% year-over-year. Turning to investment activities, capital invested in the quarter, totalled $21 billion. In private markets, our real assets platform invested $9 billion of capital, including $4.5 billion in real estate, driven by activity in our Americas and our European opportunistic equity strategies as well as real estate credit. Our infrastructure platform invested over $3 billion of capital led by activity in the US and Asia with $3.5 billion of PE deployment, relatively evenly spread across geographies. In public markets, GAs really added to the pace of investment activity in private credit, most meaningfully in asset-based finance as well as in direct lending. Spending a minute, actually in asset-based finance, we invest in ABF across a number of pools of capital that are all looking for different risk reward, all the way from our private credit funds and our BDC platform to global Atlantic. So the addressable market for us and available investable capital has increased materially as our credit platform’s grown. We're excited about this. And deployment here has become meaningful. In the quarter, total ABF deployment was a little over $5 billion and we had $2.4 billion in direct lending activity and Q1 alongside of this. Now shifting to investment performance, you can see these details on Page 7 of the press release. The private equity portfolio was marked down 5% in the quarter, which was right in line with a decline of the MSCI world. While over the last 12 months, the PE portfolios was up 19%, 800 basis points ahead of the MSCI world. In real assets, our portfolios continue to perform. In real estate, the opportunistic portfolio feels well positioned given its focus on industrial and multi-family themes, you see the opportunistic real estate portfolio appreciated 11% in the quarter and is up 30% over the last 12 months. And in infrastructure, a strategy in our view, that's also well positioned in an inflationary environment, you see the portfolio appreciated 6% in the quarter and it's up 11% over the last 12 months. On the credit side, leverage credit was down two for the quarter and up three over the last 12 months, essentially in line with broad high yields and leverage loan indices, while alternative credit was down 1% in the quarter and up 9% LTM. Circling back to the acquisition of the Japanese REIT, which is now known as KJRM, the acquisition adds AUM, but it really goes far beyond that. It's a wonderfully strategic transaction for us across a number of areas of focus, including real estate Asia, perpetual capital, as well as private wealth. And one final note here as a piece of the financing for the acquisition, in April, we raised approximately $475 million equivalent of Japanese yen denominated notes across a range of maturities at a weighted average coupon of around 1.2%. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I'll try and quickly step through our quarterly financials. Our management fees continue to scale at a really rapid pace, increasing by 46% in the LTM period to $2.3 billion and reaching $625 million just for the quarter alone. Our management fee growth this quarter was really driven by the fundraising activity that Craig ran through. Of note, Europe VI entered its investment period in the quarter and we had approximately $20 million of catch-up fees from the final closes of Americas XIII and Infra IV. Our capital raising success alongside our investment activity brought fee paying AUN to $371 billion, which is up 29% year-on-year. Our net transaction and monitoring fees were $306 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our capital markets franchise, which earned $255 million, almost $1 billion for the LTM period. The quarter's transactions consistent with past trends were diversified across clients, strategies as well as geographies. Our operating expenses totaled $126 million for the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, we would continue to expect modest increases here as we expand our footprint, invest in marketing and technology, and hopefully have our employees back out on the road and traveling. When you pull it all together, our fee-related earnings this quarter increased to $605 million, that's up 66% compared to just a year ago. Moving down our income statement, our realized carried interest totaled $580 million in the quarter while realized investment income came in at $349 million. In any environment, we think these are very solid results. However, when you layer on the volatility in Q1, we were quite pleased in our ability to achieve this outcome and very much reflects the breadth and scale of our firm today. Turning to our insurance segment, we had a very solid quarter generating $116 million of operating earnings. In aggregate, our after tax distributable earnings were $969 million for the first quarter or a $1.10 per share. I now want to turn to our balance sheet for a moment. During periods of market volatility, we'll hear from some who are concerned that the balance sheet increases our risk profile. That's not our perspective. It's actually quite the opposite. So we thought it'd be worthwhile explaining what we believe to be true. That having a balance sheet, especially one with the attributes of ours is a meaningful differentiator and a real positive during periods of market dislocation. Let's begin with the liability side of our balance sheet, which we think is pretty unique and a real source of differentiation. We are very fortunate to have access to long-dated and low cost liabilities. The average maturity of our recourse debt outstanding, including our recent Yen issuance is approximately 20 years with a weighted average coupon of about 3.5% and a 100% of that coupon is fixed. So we have minimal duration risk, no exposure to margin calls, our after-tax cost of debt is less than 3% and we have no risk around rising interest rates. In terms of the asset side of our balance sheet, as you'd expect, we have a very deep commitment to asset allocation risk, which has helped deliver exceptional results for our shareholders. Over the last one, three and five years, our annual returns have been 15%, 20% and 16% respectively. And as we go a layer deeper around KKR's investment portfolio, one of the key strategic decisions we made a number of years ago was the launch of core private equity business. It's a great example of how we used our balance sheet to help create what we believe is today, the largest business of its kind and an important contributor to our management fees and fee-related earnings, as well as representing the largest allocation we have on the balance sheet today. Core private equity is a long duration strategy. We expect to hold these investments for 10 to 50 plus years and believe they carry a more modest risk return profile compared to traditional private equity. We're looking for mid-to-high teens gross IRRs that we can compound for north of a decade. These are businesses we believe have strong secular tailwinds with defensible market positions, solid cash flow dynamics and as a result, benefit from a more stable earnings profile. And with equity and fixed income indices, our 5% plus in the quarter, a key reason our balance sheet portfolio was flat in Q1 was the 3% appreciation in our core portfolio. This portfolio is performing extremely well, and we believe has many of the right attributes to outperform if we go through a period of volatility and real inflation, including having real pricing power. Today, core private equity accounts for 30% of our balance sheet investments or $5.5 billion. Now, we entered core private equity, not only because we thought it would be a stable long-term compounder for our balance sheet, but also because it's highly synergistic with our overall business model. We were confident that we had the ability to become a global leader in core PE asset management, and that our capital markets business would be able to support these investments over time as they access both the debt and equity capital markets. So from a standing start five years ago, we've put together this incredible global portfolio, which now number over 15 companies and growing, and with $32 billion of AUM that is third party capital together with balance sheet capital, we believe we have the largest core PE asset management business in the world and a return since inception have been very strong with a gross IRR of 26%, which gives us the confidence that we'll be able to continue to scale the franchise. And alongside the management fees, we'll earn over the duration of these long data investments, we are also entitled to an annual allocation of carried interest from our clients, which we earn every Q1. For 2021 performance alone, we generated approximately $250 million of carry, which is reflected in Q1 results. So the opportunity for performance-related revenue can be a very significant one-over time with continued compounding, deployment and performance. Moreover, our core portfolio companies have generated approximately 10% of capital markets fees over the last couple of years and as the portfolio grows, we'd expect transaction activity to grow alongside it. So to recap, we have created an exposure on our balance sheet that has performed extremely well and has more stable return characteristics. And we have been able to meaningfully augment our asset level return by becoming the leading asset manager in the base and therefore creating a combination of incremental management fees and carry as well as capital markets revenues. Given the increased scale and diversification of our balance sheet portfolio, we have decided to enhance our disclosure. In our 10-Q beginning this quarter, we will provide the 20 largest balance sheet positions with their cost and fair value, instead of just our five largest investments. We think this will enhance transparency and with 13 of the top 20 positions, as of March 31st being core private equity investments, it will help highlight the performance of this portfolio going forward. Now, turning back to our broader balance sheet strategy and the benefits it provides in periods of dislocation. We think this is the type of environment where our connected and collaborative business model excels. This was particularly evident in the first half of 2020, where I think we really outperformed. Having access to this additional source of capital when the market goes risk off is hugely valuable and we would bet all investment firms would love this of liquidity in markets like these. And finally, there's obviously a huge advantage of this capital base as we pursue strategic acquisitions. The best example of that, there's really no way that we would've been able to pursue Global Atlantic in early 2020 when capital markets were severely dislocated without the benefit of our capital base. And as Craig mentioned, we recently announced a highly strategic acquisition of a Japanese REIT manager, where we funded the entirety of the $1.8 billion purchase price without issuing any equity. We understand the value of that limited dilution to all shareholders, especially right now, given our current trading price. Between these two transactions alone, we expect to generate well north of $300 million of fee-related earnings next year with most coming from perpetual capital. And we required relatively little equity dilution to be able to achieve that. So w0e're using our balance sheet to generate really high ROEs while at the same time, creating additional FRE. And while supporting all this business building and inorganic activity, we've used the balance sheet to buy back our own stock. Since 2015, we have used $2.2 billion to repurchase or retire, 85 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.50. So hopefully that helps provide additional context around the balance sheet, including some examples of its strategic value and how that can enhance overall economic outcomes across different market environments. With that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. It's been a dynamic three months since our last call and there's certainly more information to process and uncertainty to navigate. While environments like this are anxiety creating for most, it is exactly times like this, when the strength of our culture and business model becomes more apparent. Our connected firm and culture is excellent at making sure information travels and opportunities find the right pools of capital. With valuations down and costs of capital up, more companies need solutions that are not readily apparent and our clients want more information. The result is the investments we make during times like these have the potential for higher returns and our clients develop an even better understanding of what makes us special. Said another way, when dislocation occurs, you get a real sense for culture and investment acumen, and we feel incredibly well-positioned for this environment. We have record dry powder. We have clients that trust us. We have multiple growing businesses globally. We have sustained our connected culture and we feel ready for what's next. I'm sure we'll talk more to today about the macro and what all this means, but regardless of speculation about near term rates, inflation and the economy, we remain focused on executing our strategy and confident we will achieve the five-year plan we shared with you in November. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could start with fundraising comments. For the last couple of months, we've heard a lot and talked a lot about some of the crowdedness in the private equity space. It doesn't seem to be affecting you guys a whole lot, given your comments on the latest fundraisers and obviously Europe is going quite well as well. So while I understand it's probably hard to generalize, but maybe you can help us sort of contextualize what are you hearing from LPs that's going well and maybe some of the areas as you look out for the next 12 to 18 months that could become more challenged with respect to your own fundraising efforts.
Scott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. Good morning. We've heard some of the same comments you have regarding the environment. You're right. We're not really being impacted by this dynamic, but let me give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing and why that's the case. It is true. We are hearing from some LPs that they're seeing GPs come back to the market faster than expected and is a bit of a crowding effect. This is particularly true from our seats around the more traditional and institutional investors. So think some of the public pension funds and some sovereign wealth, but importantly, it's the traditional investors in private equity proper. We're not hearing that about other alternative asset classes. We're also not hearing that from newer investors in the alternative asset class broadly defined including PE. So from our vantage point, we raised $26 billion in the first quarter, $132 billion in the last 12 months and as a reminder, we raise almost all of our flagship private equity funds over the last couple of years. So it's a bit over $40 billion for that fund cycle. So any private equity market crowding is just not impacting what we're doing today. If you look at where we're raising money this year, most of the dollars we're raising is around real estate, infrastructure and credit, where we have a lot of investor interest. If anything, we're seeing that interest go up as inflation and rates rise. So we're really not experiencing that crowding dynamic for multiple reason and that's before you even get to the increased interest from private wealth and insurance company and all the new entrants that we've talked about in prior quarters. So we continue to feel great about how we're positioned. We're not changing our plans for the year. And in terms of your question about what do we see, kind of down the road that could impact us, there's nothing negative. We're kind of feeling a little bit like right now, real assets and credit where you want to be and we're lined up well against that.
Alex Blostein: Great. Thanks for that. And my follow up is around the wealth channel and Scott, you mentioned you guys are kind of continuing your build out there. I wanted to zoom in on KREST a little bit, really strong investment performance, looks like you guys are up 9%-ish year to date, and that's on the back of north of 20% return last year. The pace has been slower than maybe some of us would've expected. So wondering if you can talk to some of the hurdles that you might be facing in accelerating growth in KREST and getting it out on platforms and what would it take for that product to scale perhaps a little bit faster?
Craig Larson: Hey Alex, this Craig, why don't I start? And before we -- why don't I take a step back even to just to begin. Look, we think overall the opportunity within private wealth to introduce these tailored democratized products is massive and we think we're really well positioned against this really interesting asset class. And over time, we do expect to have democratized products really across all of our asset classes and alongside of this, we're continuing to invest in sales, marketing data, digital talent, etcetera. So where we are today and we do tend to look at these in a more aggregate basis. We've got the three broad democratized solutions. They're on multiple platforms and on top of that, we have bespoke solutions. They're tailored for individual platforms. Looking across these products, we have about $5.6 billion of AUM and I don't think we really want on these calls to get in the habit of giving individual updates on all of these. I think the overall takeaway that we want you to have is one, we've got a great brand that we think in this channel is second to none, an exceptional long-term track record. I think that can be buttressed from some of the individual product track records that again, appreciate you're noticing. We think we have a proven ability to innovate in product design and we have strong relationships at all levels with these distribution partners. So it's a really exciting long-term opportunity, and we actually feel great about the progress that we've made to date.
Alex Blostein: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just given everything going on from inflationary backdrop, rising rates, supply chain bottleneck, so we're just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see that impacting your portfolio companies. And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're helping your portfolio companies manage through this environment. And if you could just update us on what sort of revenue and EBITDA growth trends you're seeing across your portfolios.
Robert Lewin: Hey, Mike, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. So, as we're looking across our portfolio today, obviously like others, we're seeing a stickier inflation environment. There's three things that we're watching quite a bit. One is labor availability and wage inflation. We're certainly seeing that across our portfolio on a global basis. In, particularly in the US, we're focused on housing short supply there due to underbuilding over the last 15 years, especially as millennials now are moving their way into prime home ownership years. And then the last thing that I think you know is creating the stickiness is just an under-spend on CapEx related to energy supply, which is going to continue put pressure on pricing there. Now, the one thing that we're definitely seeing on the other side of this across our portfolios is an easing around supply chain. And so as we look at 2022, our expectation on inflation is we're going to be in the 7% to 8% range. We do see that moderating into 2023. There's a lot of work that we're doing across our portfolio right now to share best practices. Obviously a lot of work for years has gone into interest rate hedging, and that continues given a potential increase here in rates going forward. But you would've heard us on these calls and in other forums for a long period of time talking about these potential inflationary trends. We feel really good about how we've set up the broader portfolio. As you look at the underlying revenue and earnings growth across our portfolio, it's continues to be exceptionally strong and we feel really good with how we've positioned the overall portfolio going forward.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Michael it's Scott. Let me just add a couple things. As you know, we have taken this thematic approach the last several years. One of the things that we have been focused on besides some of the very specific themes we've discussed in the past is we knew at some point inflation would show up. So we've been quite focused on investing in businesses all around the world that have real pricing power. And that's part of the reason I think you've seen the portfolio perform well, and in terms of your question about how we're helping our portfolio companies, in addition to the very specific procurement programs and other things that we do to kind of be able to use our scale thoughtfully, we're making sure that they have access to the information that we have, that the information is traveling. They can see what we're seeing across the markets and I think that's helped them get ahead of what you know is kind of happening in some of these supply chains. And the portfolio is performing well. Our stats through last year revenues and EBITDA in a lot of parts of what we're doing up 20%, 30%, we continue to see very strong trends in the first quarter, despite the macro backdrop.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And just as a follow up question, just around rising rates, I was hoping maybe you could help frame for us how you see rising rates impacting different parts of your business. Maybe just in credit, maybe you could help us understand what portion of the credit book is floating rate and then when we look at GA, how should we think about the sort of repricing of that portfolio there in terms of rising rate benefit, and then on the fixed rate side, how do to think about the timeframe for that? Is there any sort of risk around the liabilities rescinding customer rescision activity in a higher rate environment?
Scott Nuttall: Yeah, of course. All good questions. Thanks Mike. So, there's obviously a lot of pros and cons across our business as it relates to a rising rate environment. But on balance, we feel like we're relatively pretty well positioned. You reference that we've got a very sizable credit business. Most of our leverage credit AUM is floating rate in nature. Most of our private credit AUM is also floating rate in nature. And so as interest rates go up, our returns will go up. And as you know, most of our fun products, our hurdles are fixed. So the likelihood of earning additional incentives goes up as well. On the whole, as we look at Global Atlantic and there's some puts and takes, we think a rising rate environment over time is largely a net positive to Global Atlantic and what you can see certainly is rising rates impacting the fixed income book you referenced, but our assets and liabilities are very well matched at Global Atlantic and so as interest rates rise, the value of your liabilities effectively offset the degradation and value in your assets, in a rising rate environment. I think the other important point to note across KKR and I reference this in our prepared remarks, think about our own liability structure. We've set ourselves up a 20-year duration capital that's all fixed in nature at less than a 3% after-tax cost of debt. And then I think the last thing that we think about at KKR in this kind of a rising rate environment, increased volatility in the markets, potential for multiples to come down is we sit on $115 billion of dry powder across the firm. That's a record number for us and really allows us, I think, to be on our front foot as it relates to investing through this period of time.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.
Glenn Schorr: Hello there. Thanks. So a question, capital markets and transaction fees were pretty good, pretty darn resilient considering the environment. But the markets, got a little worse in April. So I wonder if you could just help talk through, exits down, but deployment is good, diversification is good, like tell us what to expect because I feel like people discount it as a component of management fees, but it's a big piece and it seems to be more resilient than something. Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Hey Glen, it's Rob I'll start off here. So last quarter what we talked about on this call was that we felt like in normal functioning markets, our capital markets is a plus or minus $200 million a quarter type of revenue business. Now in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we were on the plus side of that. Probably a couple things in Q1 this year that we were expecting in Q2 that probably got pulled forward a bit, but I think what's more important is that not mistaken and I think you reference this in your question, not mistaken the quarter-to-quarter variability in our income with the durability of our franchise, as well as its growth prospects. And what you've seen, I think over the last number of years is both, highly durable pipeline to potentially generate fees, a broadening of transactioning transactions and just loss of growth areas and those growth areas are going to come from continuing to follow KKR's loan growth. I referenced core private equity a little bit earlier, but there's a number of different opportunities like that across the firm and obviously we believe we're going to continue to be able to take a lot of share given our business model and our access to talent with third party clients as well. And so as we think about that business and the future, we're very excited to continue to invest behind that and we see a lot of growth over the next number of years.
Glenn Schorr: That's great. Something you said during the prepared was interesting on ABS deployment I think you said $5 billion with an average fee. So the question I have is you're -- do you expect to be increasing the ramp in terms of ABF both growth and deployment on a quarter basis, and is that going to increase and give a higher steady fee flow coming up from that? I'm just curious on how big of a contributor can that get to?
Craig Larson: Yeah, Glen it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question, and honestly, we probably don't spend enough time talking about the platform that we've built here. So, first taking a step back, ABF is a massive market. So it's 4.5 trillion in size and it's expected to go to 7 trillion plus over the coming four or five years, by, in comparison, the high yield market is a 1.5 trillion market. So we're already talking about a market that is multiples of the high yield market with better growth prospects and much like leverage lending to corporates, look ABF plays a critical part in the financing market. So it's helping finance day-to-day operations through mortgages, credit cards, receivables, financings, equipment leasing, etcetera and what you have is alongside of this massive market, you have high barriers to entry and honestly, in our view, a lack of scale capital. So we're finding attractive risk return and at the same time, we also like the diversification on top of regular away or away from regular way traded credit. So in terms of us in our approach, really three things of note. One, as we noted during the prepared remarks, we have different pools of capital and we're looking for different risk rewards. So that's all the way from private credit funds in the BDC to Global Atlantic. So the addressable market is huge. Our available capital has increased materially. And so to your point, this is why you're seeing this ramp in deployment for us. The second point is we've been busy. So last year deployment exceeded $15 billion, including GA, $5 billion this quarter. So yes, this is as the overall credit platform has grown, this becomes a really interesting air area for us and third, and this is important, we've partnered with 15 or so specially financed platforms globally and those folks who are originating opportunities, that from our view again, are otherwise difficult to access. So these platforms have 5,000 employees over a $100 billion of AUM. They're global, it's across industries, and they're helping us access attractive risk return. So again, we've built this unique platform, which allows us to have confidence when we think of the forward origination. So it's becoming a growing and interesting part of the firm. No question.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks, Craig. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please receive your question.
Bill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Look forward to looking through that queue a little bit later on. In terms of maybe going into the new course since the dynamics have changed pre-dramatically first quarter to second quarter, even within the period, can you talk a little bit about where you've seen the opportunity to deploy quarter to date? And then I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to maybe the monetization activity and how the decline in the private equity and the net accrue carries sequentially might impact the opportunity for that realization outlook. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thanks Bill. It's Craig. Why don't I start on deployment and then Rob will give the modernization update and look, deployment is a meaty question. So you have inflation interest rates outlook for economic growth, all being front of mind for us as they have in for some time. And alongside of that we expect a number of rate hikes this year with central banks tricking their balance sheet. So against these topics, we're expecting more volatility. So, what are the implications of this? If you one as a firm, we need to be as connected as ever, and we need to continue to be thematic. So in terms of areas of focus for us, a couple of thoughts. One, you've already heard this from what Rob and Scott said earlier, but get long pricing power. So with labor shortages, higher input costs, we think companies with pricing power, our advantage. Number two, own more collateral-based cash flows. So we believe real assets investments that can keep up with nominal GDP are interesting. So that's infrastructure, real estate asset based finance and you heard us again in the prepared remarks. When you look at private, when we're asked about deployment, it often tends to be with a private equity lens for us. So if you look in, both last year and as well as in the first quarter, private equity deployment, as a percentage of our firm has been a teen's percentage. And so as the breadth of the firm's increased, you've seen these real assets become materially greater for us in terms of deployment. So when you look at real assets, in terms of private markets deployment real assets, we're 55% of private markets deployment in 2021, 67% of deployment in the first quarter of this year. Three, digitization automation logistics we're in the midst of an innovation boom in disruption and technological change from our standpoint spins continue. Four, security, including energy security, data payment, cyber, all areas and these are areas where we think we bring a unique lens in a lot of industry expertise. And then five, we're in many ways a savings bull market. And in Asia, you have a billion millennials who want to build a safety net through increased savings for the families. So that means themes like nesting, retirement products, financial planning, all should benefit. And I think the other point in this again, I would just touch on relates to culture and this I'd reinforce something that Scott had touched on, but, we have a culture that's wonderfully connected and our view and dislocation occurs, that some solutions for companies become less apparent and that's when you get a real sense for culture and acumen and we think we have a culture that really allows us to stay wonderfully connected and allows us to be on our front foot in these periods.
Robert Lewin: Hey, Bill. It's Rob. Let me follow up on your question around returns and monetization. You referenced our Q1 returns in private equity. Just want to put that into context for a bit. We were up 46% in 2021 in PE. And so we gave back about five points in Q1, but over the last 15 months, our PE portfolios still up on 40%. And as you think about that decline, quarter on quarter, the down five points, we actually had a position at 12/31 that was marked at about 24 times multiple of money that traded down about 40% in the quarter, still marked at 14 times multiple of money, still a fantastic investment for us at 3/31 and represented a good chunk of that decline. In terms of the impact around monetization, we feel great about our monetization pipeline, right now, certainly relative to where we are from overall volatility in the markets and so you saw a very healthy Q1 monetization revenue number and as we head into Q2, you're based on transactions that have happened, or that we have line of sight to either through signed deals and LOIs or equivalent, we already have line of sight to $600 plus million of revenue that we feel good about. And I think this represents a couple things. One, just the overall breadth of KKR's portfolio today, global nature, different products, and two, that underlying strength of our portfolio that we've talked about. Now like all quarters, there's definitely some risk in some of these deals happening, but at the same time, given the strength of the pipeline, I referenced there's some upside to these numbers as well. And just in terms of character of revenue, assuming that we're able to achieve these numbers, I'd say about ballpark 75%, that revenue would come from realized performance revenue and then the balance would come from realized investment income. Hopefully that helps provide a bit of color there Bill.
Bill Katz: That's super helpful. And then just as a follow up, I'm not sure if you Rob, or Scott, you want to chime in, but there's been some conversation around some budding regulation in the insurance side. I guess there's sort of a split house between your peers about whether not having a balance sheet is a good or a bad thing with that. I just appreciate your ownership of GAs maybe slightly different to all that. Can you talk a little bit about how you might see any regulatory risk in the insurance business, in any pros or cons that were opportunities that might surface for you as a result? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. Hey Bill, it's Rob. So we talked a bit about this last call. I'd say really no new update from us. What we're focused on with Global Atlantics focused on is continuing to have a really close and transparent relationship with its regulators. We know that the regulatory community continues to gather information and industry feedback, and we want to make sure that Global Atlantic are part of that. Beyond that, there's not a ton that we can comment on other to say that we really don't anticipate many changes to the business model of trying to thoughtfully invest behind the long-term promises that we've made to policy holders. And so, we feel again overall very constructive around the Global Atlantic relationship with its regulators and are focused on continuing that type of transparency in the future.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Brian Mckenna: Great, thanks. If we annualize the first quarter FRE, you're at a $2.75 run rate for 2022. And as you noted before, back in November, you updated your FRE target to $4 plus in five years or by 2026. So if you're approaching $3 FRE this year, are you willing to move forward this five-year timeline at all?
Robert Lewin: It's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. Listen, we don't spend honestly a ton of time thinking about, FRE near-term target is not how we manage our business. And so I think what you're less likely to get from us is a continual update around where we see FRE going in the short term. But what I would tell you is that we will update you hopefully very continually on how we see our business trending. And hopefully what you've heard from us is the level of excitement we have across our firm today. We have so much more momentum today than we had even six or 12 months ago. You look at many of the big product raises we've had over the last six or 12 months, we've well exceeded the fundraising targets that we had for those. We're likely to have Scott mentioned close to 30 products in the market over the course of the next 12 months, many of which are poised to scale in areas like infrastructure, real estate and floating rate credit, areas where we're seeing real secular growth. Obviously Global Atlantics market positioning and where they're sitting from a growth perspective is much better than when we underwrote that transaction two years ago. And a lot of momentum across our capital markets business as I referenced. So our expectation is for really robust near-term and long-term FRE growth. And hopefully that helps give you a little bit of color with that, providing continual updates around FRE targets.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. The only color I'd add Brian is historically, if you look back when we've shared kind of a view as to where we might end up, we've had a tendency to outperform. Our intention is to continue that record.
Brian Mckenna: Yes. Got it. Helpful. And then could you talk about the mix of your net unrealized carried interest? How much of the $4.2 billion is tied to traditional private equity products and then how much is related to newer strategies that have expanded meaningfully over the past several years, and then how should we think about that mix evolving over time?
Scott Nuttall: Yeah, it's a good question. I'd say it's still very much weighted towards our traditional private equity products, our regional private equity products today, but you are starting to see a climb in our unrealized carried interest in infrastructure real estate in particular. And as we think about mix and as we look forward to what that can become over time, we certainly see a much higher percentage of our realized carried interests coming from areas like infrastructure and real estate and parts of our credit business.
Brian Mckenna: Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please see a few questions.
Patrick Davitt: Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked. Could you maybe walk through the economic impact of KGR in particular to AUM and the earnings and maybe also frame how its organic growth has tracked over the last few periods?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. It's Rob. So what we've announced is at current exchange rates, I think close to $14-ish billion of incremental AUM, that's all perpetual capital to managed REITs in the Japan market, we see a lot of opportunity to grow that franchise in Japan. We see a real opportunity to leverage that team and their strength in the Japan markets for the benefit of both our core plus franchise in Japan, as well as our opportunistic franchise in the region. So we believe we should be able to raise more capital from those strategies as a result of this transaction. And lastly, we're setting up our capital markets business to make sure that we're able to support the franchise locally in Japan, as they pursue acquisitions on quite a regular or basis, as well as refinancings. In terms of the economic implications, what we set is that our expectation is on a synergized basis. We should be able to deliver around a $100 million of incremental FRE from that platform in 2023.
Patrick Davitt: Great, thanks. And then how is the organic growth looked?
Scott Nuttall: It's been strong and they've done a couple things, I think really well. One, they launched the second REIT, which has had a good market following trading at a really nice level relative to book and their organic flows have been strong as well. So this is a business that was started not all that long ago by me to BC [ph] and UBS together. And so really it's been their entire growth has been organic in nature.
Patrick Davitt: Great. Thanks. And then one quick follow up on the $600 million pipeline. Is that what you expect to close in 2Q or is that kind of a two quarter view?
Scott Nuttall: No, that's a one quarter view based on what we have line of sight on today. So that would be all Q2.
Patrick Davitt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next questions is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I was looking for a state of the union on your Pan Asia business, especially given the Japanese REIT acquisition. And you also have a pretty big pipeline of fundraising in your Asian products over the near term. But what I was really looking for is what were the real strategic merits of the Japanese REIT acquisition, including cross sell. And then also, how is your China business faring following some decoupling between the West and China? And I know I asked a few questions in there. So I'm just not going to ask the follow up.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks Craig. Maybe I'll start and Craig will chip in here along the way. In terms of just state of the union to our AsiaPac business, we've talked about this in prior calls. We have every expectation that over time, our AsiaPac business will be as big as our US business and we're investing behind that deal and I think the acquisition of the Japanese REIT manager is very much consistent with that overall theme. Just to put some numbers around it. I think at the end of 2019, we had about $20 billion of AUM in AsiaPac. Two plus years forward proforma for the acquisition, we're close to $55 billion. So almost a tripling of our AUM in a short period of time. I think we've got a lot of competitive advantages in the region and we've got a real opportunity to take advantage of that head start, we have the access, we have to talent really across the region to be able to drive further growth. In terms of the strategic merits of the acquisition, honestly, that piece of it was a really short conversation. We want to be able to double down on our lead in Asia. We've got ambitions to really be able to scale a real estate business, both in AsiaPac and in Japan, the second largest real estate market in the world and globally. We want access to more perpetual capital at the firm, as well as different avenues to be able to reach private wealth investors. And so this acquisition, really was something from a strategic perspective, made a ton of sense as we were evaluating it. Craig, you want to hit on…
Craig Larson: Yeah. Craig on China, a couple of thoughts. One, I think look, China investing in China has become more complex and so we think it's critical to have the right resources in order to navigate the complexity. So we think it's -- you need a best in class local team, but you need more. We think it's important to have specialized resources like our public affairs team, like our global Institute to help navigate that complexity. So we think China is going to continue to be a critical long term engine of global growth. So it's a very important market, no question. And we think we bring unique skills and a differentiated approach to that market. Now, I think when you look at where we've been investing, a lot of it has been behind themes like domestic consumption. So we remain committed to being a leading investor domestically in China. And we want to help leading local firms to continue to grow and prosper and we think we're well positioned and to give you a sense, just a significance overall as a firm, when you look at our exposure, it does remain quite modest just given the breadth of our firm today. So, investments in China from an AUM standpoint are probably, a little over 1% of our AUM just to give you a sense of scale,
Craig Siegenthaler: Craig, Rob. That was perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. That was my question on Asia as well. So that's -- I think that was a good detail. Can you hear me?
Scott Nuttall: We can, yeah,
Brian Bedell: Great. Okay, so then I'll just do one as well. Going back to Craig, I think what you said in the prepared remarks on enhancing a few related earnings with other creative ideas like KKR, but maybe if you can just talk about what you view as maybe the pipeline for doing more acquisitions to enhance to -- grow the FRE inorganically and how important is private wealth management within that thought process?
Robert Lewin: Sure. Brian. It's Rob I'll take that. So when we evaluate anything for our balance sheet, the first measure that we're going to look at always is going to be what drives the highest and best ROE over a long period of time. Now given how we're situated, I think with our brand and our track record and our access to distribution, there's a lot of inorganic asset management activity where we think we can help make those businesses better. Maybe they can help make us better. And ultimately that's, what's going to drive the highest ROE. And that's what you saw. I think, in the acquisition we closed last week. That's what you saw with our partnership with Global Atlantic, and we've got multi different examples of that over the years. And so we've got a team that's very much focused on how we can really leverage the core competencies we have here at KKR to be able to continue drive ROE and we think a lot of times that's going to lend itself to incremental FRE as well, but that's not necessarily going to be the primary driver here of any transaction. But you're certainly seeing that as it relates to the things that we've done, inorganically over the last number of years. The last point on inorganic growth while we're going to be focused on it. And it's something that we think is a real opportunity here, long term, it was referenced earlier in the call that we had a couple of targets we had put out there four plus dollars of FRE. seven plus dollars of TDE that was on an in -- that was on a organic basis and so anything that we would do from an inorganic perspective on the FRE side should certainly be accretive to that.
Craig Larson: Yeah. The only thing I would add Brian, is I think the point we're trying to get across as well, we'll continue to remain active looking at inorganic opportunities and that's something we'll keep you updated on, but if you just look back, I think what we're trying to say is that the balance sheet has allowed us to pursue those with minimal equity issuance while also buying back 10% of our outstanding shares since 2015. And if you think about it, Marshall Waste, Franklin Square, Global Atlantic, what we talked about with core, not the J-REIT that's over $200 billion of AUM that was bought with minimal equity dilution and using the balance sheet as that strategic weapon. And a lot of the things that we've done that I listed have been done during periods of time where there's some dislocation or some volatility.
Brian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you very much.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arnold [ph] with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Oh yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow up on the on the M&A question. I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit more generally about corporate M&A in the market in general, given what you're saying about certain pockets of the market being more congested on the fundraising side, and also maybe a more challenging market for GP IPOs. Generally, are you seeing a bigger pipeline of potential deals at the industry level?
Robert Lewin: Hey, Arnold, it's Rob. We weren't able to hear all of that question. I think is relates to corporate M&A and the pipeline we're seeing. Certainly a lot of activity across the GP space and I think we get to take a look at quite a bit of it, but inorganic activity in our space, particularly inorganic activity, that requires integration is hard. And so while we'll look at a lot and there's quite a bit that crosses our desk and the pipeline is full, I think the likelihood of any one of these deals happening is still, relatively low and so we've been fortunate that we've been able to do some large things over the years. We would anticipate being able to do that in the future especially given that the size of the M&A pipeline line, but it's also not a need to do for us either. I think we're in a fortunate position where we've got a lot of avenues to organically really grow our business, but if we can find something where we can use our balance sheet to complement what we're doing and drive additional growth, we're certainly going to look at that.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. Arnold, this is Scott. The only thing I would add, if it's corporate M&A from a third party capital investing for our funds standpoint, as Craig mentioned that deployment's been active, the pipelines are busy and there are public private dialogues happening. So it's not as much fun to be a public company right now and so that's part of the, the pipeline that we're seeing build up. In terms of, for the firm itself, dialogue continues, it's been active and I think in an environment like this probably makes people think it, maybe it's not such a bad idea that to be part of a larger firm that has a lot of different ways to win and raise capital and invest. So we're active on both fronts.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Rufus Hone: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to your comments around the balance sheet and I hear you on the differentiation and the optionality it offers, but it seems like many investors haven't given you full credit for the balance sheet yet. So would you consider capping the size of the balance sheet at some point or pursuing other strategic options? If the market doesn't give you credit for your balance sheet over the long term? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Yeah Rufus. Thanks for the question. I think the first thing to consider as you think about our balance sheet strategy is that it's very much an aligned strategy. KKR employees are the largest group of shareholders in the firm on an almost 30% of KKR. So we start from a very aligned perspective and as we sit here today, we see more opportunities to leverage the broader platform and ecosystem of KKR to drive ROE with that capital inside of KKR. And so long as that continues and we're able to drive additional ROE on that capital base for the benefit of all shareholders, then, you're going to see a consistency strategy. To the extent that that changes over time, where we're not seeing that attractive level of return, then obviously we might have a different strategy, but certainly as we sit here today, we are highly convicted in the way that we're operating the opportunities we see and the long-term accretion that we're able to create for all shareholders by virtue of the capital base that we have.
Robert Lewin: Yeah. The only thing I'd add Rufus is if you think about the job we have get to think about how do we double the stock price as quickly as possible? How do we double our market cap as quickly and thoughtfully as possible given the risks we're taking? And the reason that we built the model that we have is that we believe with the combination of third party capital plus our own capital invested alongside, we can create that next $50 billion and then, the next a $100 billion of market cap after that with greater line of sight and more confidence. So no, the answer to the question is, no, we're not planning to cap it but, over time, if the market doesn't certainly appreciate the model of the way that we do, we have lots of different things that we can do to express our view on that. We've been buying back stock, we've been making acquisitions and converting balance sheet into fee-related earnings. There's lots of different things that we can do strategically with that balance sheet, but that's really where it's coming from. How do we get the market cap from $50 billion $200 billion and so forth,
Rufus Hone: Understood. And as a quick follow up, any thoughts around shifting the compensation mix between FRE and carry rates to a greater extent? Thank you.
Robert Lewin: No, is the short answer Rufus. I think we feel good about the compensation structure that we put in place now a little bit more than a year ago. I think it's working really well for our firm making sure we've got alignment in the right place between our employees, our shareholders, and our limited partners and we think that balance is about right for us right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Yeah, good morning. I like Craig's formulation of the state of the union overview. And I wonder if we could have something similar on your approach to energy invest because, you have had four different energy or natural resource dedicated funds. None of them are investing and obviously fossil fuels has been just a terrible place to be for most of the last decade and people were wondering whether it would ever be an investible sector again. Now there's obviously a big capital need there, but at the same time, you've kind of got to navigate your ESG commitments and I guess I'm wondering, if you can explain the rules of the road as you see them between investing in fossil fuels versus new energy transition and how you plant to thread that needle.
Craig Larson: Sure. Chris, great question. Why don't I start, it's Craig. So look at a high level, we're committed to investing in the energy transition and the shift to clean energy. So reflecting this, we invest in a diverse range of energy sources. So let's touch first on renewables. So think, global clean energy developers and operators, we've been increasingly active in this space and you've seen that across really a number of strategies, including areas for us like infrastructure well, as our impact business. Now alongside of that is conventional energy interactivity here is really being done through a permanent capital vehicle that we own a teen's percentage of that's called Crescent Energy. And we think Crescent can become a real leader in developing best in class ESG programs in addition to creating significant equity value. We receive management fees that increase over time as Crescent scales its business. It can send a fee eligible based on the total return of the equity and from a business standpoint, Crescent has low leverage. It's free cash flow positive, has an excellent team in place. And it is operating in an area that we think there's real M&A opportunities. So, that's our overall approach. Hopefully that gives you a better sense.
Chris Kotowski: Yeah. And just I was curious of about the idea of like a traditional fossil fuel dedicated fund. Is that an idea the market that who's placed has come and gone, or…
Craig Larson: I think it and maybe this is a -- this gets perhaps into a little bit of a history lesson around Crescent, honestly, Chris. So, in 2020, we traded in an entity that was called Independence Energy and through that, we had combined our energy income and growth fund some energy investments from the balance sheet, co-investment assets and those were contributed together with investments from an insurance client and that formed Independence Energy. And then what you saw five or six months ago, it was in December of 2021 was we merged that entity with a public ENT company to form Crescent. So Crescent is a $2.6 billion market cap company. Again, we own a teens percentage, but what really Crescent is, is the next step and it's the next evolution of those dedicated of funds for us. So that's really the -- that's how our views and our focus is really, we expect will be through Crescent.
Robert Lewin: Yeah, there's no plans Chris, for a traditional fossil fuels fund. We haven't actually invested in conventional oil and gas in our private equity fund since 2018. Don't have any plans to really -- the work we're doing is through Crescent on the more conventional side and focused on improving the ESG footprint of every investment that they make and the team is doing a great job around that. And then as Craig mentioned, we're doing a lot in renewables across infrastructure, asset-based finance through GA and otherwise. So those are some of the areas of focus right now.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. Thank you. That's it for me.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is on the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.
Finian O'Shea: Hi, good morning. Mostly asked and answered for me as well. But if you haven't updated us on today's call on the private wealth progress, do you have any highlights for upcoming product rollout type ideas or progress in relationships on across the retail channels?
Craig Larson: So Finian again, we actually feel great about the progress we've made. Rome wasn't built in a day and how we're positioned against this opportunity. Nothing to announce right at the moment as it relates to incremental products. But again, over time, we expect to have democratized products across all of our asset classes and we're investing in all of the areas that we think it takes to be successful in this channel. Reflecting that point of view, we've said a couple of quarters ago that we think new capital raised from individuals is going to be a third to half of new capital race for us as a firm in the medium term and no change in that outlook or point of view for us. It's just a really exciting opportunity that when we look at our brand, our long term track record, the ability that we have to innovate and product design and the relationships we have, we just think we're really position against this enormous market.
Finian O'Shea: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes into the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please just see with your questions.
Robert Lee: Thanks so much, and thanks so much for your patience this morning with all the questions. So just had one last quick one. Many of peers have either acquired or has started to build organically, a secondaries or solutions capabilities if you will. Can you just remind us of, your interest in that business segment, which is I think not a place you've traditionally you've been focused on, but it seems to be a hot sector for across the industry and for many peers.
Craig Larson: Yeah. Hey Rob. It is certainly a sector, we continue to look at. It is not a need to do type of acquisition for us. But if we find a platform that we've got conviction can be a top three player that we can help make them better, they can help make us better and valuation makes sense. It certainly could be something that we could pursue in the future and so, yeah, we've got, as I mentioned earlier, we've got a team that looks across different inorganic opportunities of the firm as we line up different potential sub-sectors of the asset management space. Clearly the addressable market and the secondary space is quite large. But from our perspective, it's got to work for us. And it's got to be something that we've got a lot of conviction is going to fit in well within our firm which in part is going to require it to be a top three player. And so we'll continue to keep you updated of course on our progress and our thinking but that's where we are right now.
Robert Lee: Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks for your patience this morning.
Craig Larson: Thank you. Our pleasure. Thanks
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Thank you, our everybody for your time and patience this morning and your interest in KKR. We look forward to following up with many of you directly and if not, we look forward to giving you our next update in 90 days or so. Thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Rob Lewin, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted-share basis.  Our call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release and SEC filings for cautionary factors about these statements.  Now before we jump into our results for the quarter, we'd like to take a step back and talk about KKR in full.  As we look at our business, we see 4 things. First, we see scaling. Organically, over the last 12 months, AUM at KKR increased 48%. For an asset management business of our size, that alone is a pretty remarkable statistic. And including the Global Atlantic acquisition, AUM increased 87% year-over-year.  Second, you're seeing the impact of the scaling across many of the numbers that we're reporting today. You see it in our financials. Management fees for the year increased 44%. Fee-related earnings increased 54%, while distributable earnings more than doubled. All of these figures are at a record level for us.  And you also see it in our operating statistics Investment activity, for example, is at a new level. In 2020, we invested $30 billion across the firm. In 2021, that increased to over $70 billion. And new capital raised of $121 billion for the year reflects breadth and diversification. Approximately 1/3 of that capital was raised from the broad private equity franchise, so including our growth strategies and core PE. Another 1/3 came from our real assets businesses with the remaining 1/3 coming from public markets. So fundraising was truly diversified across the firm. And the other neat point about that $121 billion is that 45% of it came from strategies that didn't exist at KKR 5 years ago. We think that says a lot about our culture and our focus on innovation.  Third, looking forward, we remain very constructive on the opportunities we have ahead of us with multiple identifiable growth avenues on a global basis. Rob is going to touch on our fundraising pipeline and our areas of focus in a few minutes. And finally, remember, we feel advantaged during periods of dislocation. There are very few long-dated pools of capital as large as ours that can take advantage of dislocations, and we have a unique business model and a unique culture that we think can lead to differentiated outcomes during these periods, and that's all alongside of $112 billion of dry powder. Suffice to say, there's plenty to focus on and a lot of compelling opportunities in the uncertain world in which we all find ourselves.  Now turning to our results. The fourth quarter was another very strong quarter for us. Fee-related earnings per share of $0.69 and after-tax distributable earnings of $1.59 per share are record quarterly figures for us. And full year FRE of $2.23 per share, an after-tax DE of $4.44 per share are record annual figures for us.  Looking at the quarter's operating metrics. New capital raised totaled $19 billion driven by several strategies across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. Notably, Healthcare Strategic Growth II held its final close, bringing the fund to almost $4 billion or approximately 3x larger than its predecessor. This brings new capital raise for 2021 to $121 billion, and this record fundraising and the addition of $98 billion from the Global Atlantic acquisition in February significantly increased our asset base. AUM now totals $471 billion, up 87% year-over-year.  The strength of this year's fundraising is importantly quite diverse, as I mentioned a minute ago, with about $70 billion from non-flagship strategies. Our younger strategies are scaling as they enter their second or third fund life, and we continue to innovate and expand into adjacencies across strategies and across geographies. And GA grew by $25 billion through block activity, alongside of organic inflows in the year.  We deployed $23 billion in the quarter. Capital invested in both traditional private equity and core private equity were strong. Our real estate platform continues to see robust deployment with real estate credit particularly operating a high run rate, and that's been amplified by Global Atlantic. Similarly, on the public market side, GA has added to the rate of private credit deployment in the quarter, most meaningfully in asset-based finance, with additional deployment in direct lending and opportunistic strategies.  Q4's activity brings capital invested for 2021 to $73 billion, up 2.5x year-over-year. We've seen a step function type change in the level of deployment driven by the size and diversity of our capital base while at the same time remaining judicious in choosing our spots.  Now just as we continue to see strength on the fundraising and deployment front, our funds and strategies continue to perform at a very high level. You can see this on Page 7 of the earnings release, where we detail investment performance for the quarter and the year across investment strategies.  And finally, I want to touch on capital return before Rob walks through our earnings profile. As you can see at the bottom of Page 2 of the release, consistent with historical practice, we're pleased to announce an increase in our annual dividend from $0.58 to $0.62 per share. This is the third consecutive year we've increased our dividend since we changed our corporate structure, and the change will go into effect beginning with any dividends to be announced for the first quarter of 2022.  And since our third quarter earnings call in November through last week, we repurchased $363 million of our stock in the open market with the majority of that coming in 2022 in the midst of all of this volatility.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Now to walk you through our quarterly P&L, our management fees increased by 49% this quarter versus Q4 of 2020. Management fee growth was driven by close across a number of active funds in the quarter. These closes, alongside our investment activity, bring fee-paying AUM to $357 billion million. The fundraising success experienced over the past few quarters is really starting to flow through this line with another $38 billion of committed capital not yet paying fees.  Our net transaction and monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise this quarter, which earned $320 million. This is a high point for us. This revenue figure also encompasses a record number of transactions in a single quarter, and we only had one fee event that was greater than $20 million.  For the year, Capital Markets totaled $847 million with revenues diversified by type, approximately 1/4 of our revenues related to each of private equity, infrastructure as well as third-party clients with the remaining quarter diversified across multiple different asset classes.  Moving to our expenses. Fee-related compensation came in right at that 22.5% mark, the midpoint of the range we've discussed previously, while our other operating expenses came in at $140 million. The increase here was driven by higher placement fees as well as professional fees given high activity levels across the firm. We are also all back in the office across most of our locations, leading to an uptick in operating costs versus this time last year. In total, this brings our fee-related earnings to $606 million for the quarter, which is up 45% versus Q4 of 2020. The quarterly and yearly FRE margin both came in at 63%. And on a per-share basis, FRE is $2.23 for the year.  Now moving on to realizations. Realized carried interest totaled $568 million in the quarter. Our realized incentive fees totaled $351 million in the quarter, largely due to Marshall Wace's strong investment performance. And realized investment income totaled $336 million. Together, these earnings streams resulted in $1.4 billion of asset management operating earnings. Our insurance segment also experienced an incredibly strong quarter with $347 million of operating earnings.  In Q4, Global Atlantic sold its interest in Origis Energy, a solar renewable energy developer, at 12x cost, resulting in a $200-plus million benefit to segment operating earnings. This was really an amazing result for Global Atlantic and all of its shareholders while still recognizing that 12x gains are not representative of our go-forward expectations here.  Excluding all variable investment income for the year at GA, ROE would have still been a bit above 14%. This return represents a strong core operating level and modestly above our 12% to 13% expected range.  Most importantly, a year into our partnership with GA, we couldn't feel any better about our collective progress, including the performance of management, the profitability of our stake, scaling of the AUM and the integration of our teams.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings were $1.4 billion for the quarter or $1.59 per share. Comparing 2021 to 2020, DE per share is up over 2x. Alongside an increase in earnings, we are also seeing continued compounding in our book value per share, which now totals $28.77. As a component of this, our 61% economic interest in Global Atlantic's book value now totals $3.4 billion, up 15% since the first quarter of our ownership.  In summary, our business continues to perform at an exceptionally high level, and this is clearly evident in both our Q4 as well as our 2021 results.  Now there are 2 additional topics I would like to go through in a bit more detail. The first is our potential. In 2021, we generated almost $5 billion of distributable operating income, really a step function increase from the $2.3 billion that we generated in 2020. And to be clear, we don't believe these results yet reflect even our run rate profitability, let alone our potential.  There are a number of reasons why we have room to run. Let's start with management fees. At 12/31, we had $38 billion of committed capital that isn't yet running through our management fee line. A year ago, that number was $20 billion. And as that $38 billion, which has a weighted average management fee north of 100 basis points, is either invested or enters its investment period, it will drive management fees in a meaningful way. And I will come to our future fundraising potential from here in just a minute.  Next are our embedded gains. Gross unrealized carry at year-end totaled $8.6 billion compared to $4.7 billion a year ago. So even after a record realization year, gross unrealized carry increased over 80%, positioning us really well for future realized performance income. And embedded balance sheet gains at 12/31 were $6.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. So similarly, while we saw a meaningful step-up in balance sheet realizations in 2021, our embedded gains increased over 50%.  And finally, as the overall footprint of the firm continues to grow, leading to increased deployment and more relationships, this, in turn, continues to expand the opportunities we expect to have in our Capital Markets business, so really strong performance in 2021 over the really meaningful potential still yet in front of us.  That leads into the second topic I'd like to touch on: fundraising and our pipeline. As we look forward, we expect to be fundraising across 30-plus strategies in 2022, so we have a lot of runway and opportunity in front of us.  In terms of areas of focus, I'd highlight 4. The first area is private wealth. We now manage a little over $50 billion in private wealth assets, and we've been investing meaningfully into this channel. Historically, private wealth has contributed about 10% to 20% of the money that we raise annually. With the investments we're making in people, technology and new product innovation, alongside the strength of our brand and our track record, we believe over time that it should be 30% to 50% of the money that we raise.  The second area would be Asia. More than half of global GDP growth is expected to come from Asia. And as a reminder, 8 of our 21 offices are in the region. We were early in Asia, and we've seen significant scaling as AUM across our Asia-dedicated strategies has gone from $20 billion to $42 billion over the last 2 years with private equity being the biggest driver of that growth. In 2022, we expect to be fundraising for 5 Asia-focused strategies outside of PE across our infrastructure, real estate, credit and growth businesses. We have a leading footprint in Asia today, and building on our presence is a priority and a big opportunity for us.  The third area would be our broader core franchises. These are all adjacent strategies to what we're doing in private equity, real estate, as well as infrastructure. So think longer-term capital, a lot of which can be raised on a continuous basis for strategies that are leveraging resources and deal flow that are already resident within the firm today. A year ago, we were at $17 billion of AUM across core. And today, that figure is north of $40 billion. In 2022, we look to continue the momentum and expect to be fundraising across 5 distinct strategies in private equity, real estate and infrastructure.  And the fourth area is what we're doing across our real estate franchise. A year ago, AUM across real estate was $15 billion. Today, that figure is $41 billion. In 2022, we expect to fundraise across 10 distinct real estate strategies, including the next generation of our opportunistic real estate strategies across all 3 geographies.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As Craig and Rob reviewed, 2021 was a very strong year with record AUM, FRE and earnings. The hard work of the last 10 to 15 years of business-building began to show up in bigger ways last year, and we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. And with a record $112 billion of dry powder, we are well capitalized to invest in opportunities presented by more volatile markets and an evolving macro picture. In summary, we feel incredibly well positioned.  While we're together today, I also want to give you a little color on our annual planning meetings. Last week, we gathered 35 of our partners for 2 full days to review where we are, where we're going and what we need to get right to capture the opportunity in front of us. It was an extremely energizing discussion.  As we discussed at our Investor Day last April, we had significant runway in all of our businesses and see the opportunity to meaningfully scale across multiple platforms and markets simultaneously, including Asia, real estate, infrastructure, our core suite of products, private wealth, growth, impact in ESG, insurance, credit and private equity, amongst others. What we discussed last week is that our progress makes us even more confident in the opportunity ahead and what these businesses can become. Said another way, we believe we can get to the destination faster than we thought a year ago, and the quantum of the growth opportunity is greater than we anticipated.  So while 2021 was a great year for the firm, what's particularly exciting is how the progress we made last year positions us for more growth in the years ahead. And critically, Joe and I have never had more confidence in our team. We have a focused and highly motivated group driving our businesses and functions and responsible for each of our growth initiatives. So we enter 2022 with significant conviction in our growth prospects, our model and our people and look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein: Why don't we start with just the dynamics around fundraising and management fee growth? And I really kind of want to zone in on a couple of things. I guess, first, whether or not the current macro conditions are having any impact on LP appetite to allocate to private markets, broadly, even if just tactically, but curious what to hear what you guys are hearing on the ground. And then, secondly, Rob, you mentioned a number of fundraising initiatives for 2022. I was hoping you could size how much you expect to raise across those 30-plus strategies and ultimately what that means for 2022 management fee growth.
Craig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? To the first part of your question, really, no change in terms of the interest level that our LPs are having from a fundraising side, and it continues to feel like we have a lot of momentum which is great, why don't I give a little bit more granularity in terms of all of those -- the areas where we're fundraising to give you a sense of the breadth of that activity for us? Rob obviously ran through the 4 areas of focus for us in 2022.  More narrowly, in private equity, we're still fundraising for Americas Private Equity. We're fundraising for our Europe private equity strategy. In growth, fundraising is launched for both the impact and next-gen tech strategies. In core, we're fundraising across the core businesses, so that's core private equity as well as core infra and core plus real estate strategies. Now the latter 2 are open ended. And in addition to core plus, in the U.S. that we've spoken about, we've also launched fundraising for core plus real estate in Europe and Asia. Both of those are also open ended, as well as in infra, where fundraising continues for the benchmark infra strategy. In real estate, in addition to the core plus strategies in all 3 geographies, we're fundraising for a stabilized real estate credit strategy and our opportunistic real estate credit strategy as well. In credit, we're active in U.S., Europe and Asia. We're fundraising for lending partners, European revolving credit, Asia credit, asset-based finance, credit opportunities and that's in addition to Global Atlantic sidecar strategy. Our CLO business has been active. And as we look to raise capital across the leveraged credit platforms and our hedge fund partnerships on a more continuous basis, and that's all in addition to the suite of democratized products that we have.  So again, really, it's -- I think the overall takeaway, lots of activity, and it just continues to feel like we have a lot of momentum.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Alex, agree with Craig, no change in LP appetite. The only incremental color I'd give is, if anything, we're seeing more interest in real assets with yield. So anything with some inflation protection, so think infrastructure and real estate. As we see inflation expectations go up, we're finding even more interest in those asset classes. Rob, do you want to pick up on the second part?
Robert Lewin: Yes, Alex. As it relates to the management fee piece of it, Alex, we've never felt as good as we do right now about our ability to sustainably grow management fees over time. Obviously, I referenced the $38 billion of capital that hasn't yet flown through our management fee line item, the 30-plus products Craig just went through, our relationship with Global Atlantic where assets are much higher than where we thought it would be and, frankly, just the new product innovation that's happening across the firm today that gives us visibility around our ability to grow management fees tomorrow. So I think the expectation should certainly be continued management fee growth from us and being able to do so on a sustainable basis over time.
Alexander Blostein: Great. And then just my follow-up is around capital management. So you guys obviously picked up the pace of buyback so far in the first quarter. Given your comments around the robustness of the business going forward, obviously, lots of capacity on the balance sheet given realizations and embedded gains. How are you thinking about the buyback at this level for the share price? And should we be thinking about acceleration in share repurchases from here?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Alex, the key for us on capital allocation is to have a consistent approach, and you've heard that for us over the last number of years, and we'd anticipate that continuing. And so as we think about our overall capital allocation strategy, we want to make sure that we're striking the right balance between capital return to shareholders and investing back into KKR for growth, so long as that can be done at high ROEs and above our cost of equity.  So let's take those in order. You would have seen, obviously, that we just increased our dividend 7%, third consecutive year since we became a C-corp where we've increased our dividend.  And then we want to continue to invest back into KKR stock, as you said. Certainly at these levels, we feel really good about our overall body of work on our share buyback. We've repurchased or retired north of 80 million shares now. That's almost 10% of KKR shares outstanding, almost 15% of our free float. And our goal is to keep our share count flat as it relates to employee dilution. So I think the expectation over time would certainly see us be in the market and acquiring and retiring KKR stock.  In terms of balancing that with overall opportunity to grow KKR, it is a big priority for us to reinvest back into KKR, whether that's in M&A or supporting new products or supporting new innovations so long as we're seeing returns that are commensurate with that capital commitment. And over the last number of years, we certainly have.  So we're going to continue to have a capital allocation framework that is very much ROE-based. We feel that's a real core competency of ours as we think about moving capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if you think about our overall capital allocation framework, I think it's also worth remembering that KKR is an employee base is the single-largest shareholder in KKR. So we come at that from a very aligned basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.
Robert Lee: Great. Maybe, first, looking at wealth management. Generating 30% to 50% of your fundraising from that channel in several years is a pretty big step-up, particularly in light of your overall fundraising. So could you maybe put a little bit more meat on the bone? Like I know you had just hired a new Head of Global Wealth Management. But whether specific products or specific things that kind of give you that confidence sitting here today that in the next couple of years, you can have that magnitude of an increase coming from that channel. I mean, what would drive that?
Craig Larson: Yes. Rob, it's Craig. Why don't I begin? So private wealth is as big a priority as we have as a firm. And the addressable market here, as everyone knows, is massive. Total client assets are estimated to be around $280 trillion. That's pension funds, sovereign wealth, insurance, private wealth combined. And private wealth is almost 65% of that and is growing, so it's a massive end market. But at the same time, allocations, as we all know, for individual investors is a fraction of what you find at institutions. And so individual investors are less than 5%. And by our research, we actually think that number is in around 2% to 3%. . We have this enormous end market. It's underpenetrated with allocations that are increasing. And so it's a huge opportunity. And I think as we think of our investment skills, our track record, combined with our brand, we really think we're exceptionally well positioned to be a winner here.  And the focus, I'd say, is really threefold. So one, we're focused on our partnerships with private wealth platforms. So in the U.S., that's the wirehouses, the independent broker-dealers, the RIAs. And outside the U.S., it's the global private banks and the regional private banks. And so the business is organized by geography here. And you're correct. You've seen some hiring related to that.  Second, we're related -- we're focused on the family capital part, so think about that single-family offices, multifamily, ultra-high net worth. And some of those folks are very large and very sophisticated. And again, we're organized by geography here.  And then third, we're focused on product creation. So historically, we've offered private fund solutions through the private wealth space. But really, there are only a limited number of private wealth investors that are qualified who could look at private funds as appropriate. So we're focusing on creating these new investment solutions, these more democratized products, democratized solutions that are in a registered fund format and have much wider applicability within the private wealth channel. So I think suffice to say, when you combine with where we are in the development of the channel, the maturing of our product set, including, and Scott mentioned this a moment ago, all the products that we have with the yields, real assets, et cetera, and put that together with our brands, which is really encouraged with how we're situated and all of the opportunities that we have ahead of us.
Robert Lee: Okay. Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, lease equity mark has been a pretty rocky start to the year, so I guess investors are generally concerned about kind of the realization outlook from here. Could you maybe update us on where things are for you guys right now through the start of the year, the first half of the quarter in Q1?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Rob, some good news here. As it relates to Q1, we already have a good amount of visibility into some pretty meaningful revenue from monetization activity. As of now, that figure is around $700 million, maybe a bit above that. As you know, that's collectively across both our performance as well as our investment income. And as a reminder, that is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q1. So we're off to a really good start there. This is one of the strongest figures we've ever had at this stage of the quarter. And then the other I know relevant thing for your models is the split. It's weighted around 75-25 carry investment income right now. So yes, we feel like a pretty good start to the year and gives us some support going into Q1 in 2022.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.
William Katz: Okay. So maybe come back to interest rates for a moment. I was wondering if you could let us know what is your rate assumption that you have that sort of supports your sort of 12% to 13% ROE for Global Atlantic? And then if rates were to go up, can you walk us through what the net impact would be between maybe a higher ROE there versus any impact on management fees?
Robert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. Maybe let's start with where we think interest rates are going, and so we do see rates certainly increasing like the rest of the market. I think we're likely to get 4 more fed funds increases this year. But at the same time, we do see that coming on the back of robust financial conditions. So our expectation is that we can be in an environment here where rates are still low or negative over the next couple of years, which I think is an overall positive place for us to be from a business model perspective.  Now of course, there are uncertainties around weights are going, but I think there's a number of areas where we're, I think, pretty well competitively positioned. As you referenced, Global Atlantic, they are largely biased to benefit from interest rates rising over time. So $120 billion of capital there as well as how we think about their individual channel and our ability to be able to generate sales from that channel we think are all positively biased in a rising rate environment.  And so I think there's a number of other areas around KKR as well where we think we're competitively well positioned. You look at our credit business, over $200 billion or close to $200 billion of AUM. Much of our third-party business there is floating rate exposure in nature. So as interest rates rise, all things equal, our returns go up. And the hurdle rates across many of those products tend to be fixed in nature, so the likelihood of earning additional incentive fees is that much higher. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.
William Katz: Okay. And just a follow-up, just coming back to maybe your prior guidance. I certainly appreciate the tone and tenor of what you're saying about the confidence. But can you sort of still triangulate back to sort of your guidance for this year in terms of $2 plus of FRE and sort of how you think about that, not only for this year, but maybe into 2023, just given the compounding nature of growth? And then maybe just sort of level set where you are in terms of the capital raising flagship of the $100 billion plus well into that as well.
Robert Lewin: Yes. No updates to the numbers. Bill, obviously, we're well ahead of where we thought we would be even 6 or 12 months ago.  And as it relates to both fundraising as well as management fee growth, this isn't just a result of acceleration of fundraisers. In many cases, we have well exceeded the expectations that we have for ourselves, and so we continue to see a robust environment to be able to raise capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see an environment where we should be able to really drive substantial management fee growth as well as FRE growth off of a base of $2.23. So we should be well ahead of our target for 2022 that we laid out. I think it was about 12 months ago.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Bill, last quarter, we said we thought we could double fee-related earnings in TDE over the next 5 years. That's still very much the case. So no updated guidance for '22, but suffice it to say, we well exceeded what we told you a year ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr: So there's -- it's been a slower start to the year for just Capital Markets activity. It's early. But if you look at all the pipelines for M&A and IPOs, they're down. I think that's just a market jitters thing. But anyway, with the slower pipeline, just curious how insulated you think -- you just gave us the number on dollars for realization pipeline. But just broader picture, as you look at the year, how susceptible could a realization pipeline or Capital Markets pipeline may or may not be to that? In the past, you've given some -- what you think the core run rate of transactional monitoring fees or Capital Markets, that would be helpful.
Robert Lewin: It's Rob. So let's -- I think it's worth spending a little bit of time on our Capital Markets business. It did have a really step-function increase in 2021. If you take a step back, our Capital Markets business over the last several quarters has averaged about $200 million of revenue per quarter. Now markets have definitely been open and compliant, but I think we've also continued to really take share here.  So I think that's -- as you think about our business in a market environment where capital is being deployed, it can be still a relatively volatile market environment. But in one where there's activity, we think that's a reasonable run rate for our business.  But much more important for us is how we take our business from the $850 million of revenue in 2021 and over the next several years continue to take a lot of share and grow that in a meaningful way. And we think we've got plans in place to be able to do that. We've gone through this a bunch of times. It includes following KKR in terms of its own product expansion, following KKR in terms of its own geographic expansion. We think by hiring the right capabilities internally, that could lead to a lot of revenue growth. And I think it's worth calling out our non-KKR issuer business, our third-party business, it generated almost $200 million of revenue in 2021. And I think that really speaks to our business model and the quality of our people, that we were able to take that business and scale to the point that is not too different from a revenue perspective from where our Capital Markets business was in aggregate not too long ago.
Craig Larson: Glenn, it's Craig. We were looking at some of these statistics and are kind of interesting, just to give you another sense of the breadth in Capital Markets fees. When you look at deployment for us as a firm, deployments increased materially, obviously. We were $30 billion in 2020, $70 billion in 2021. And if you look at where that came from and the impact of that, it had a big impact on Capital Markets revenues. So that increase in deployment for us, it really didn't come from private equity. So we invested $10 billion in 2020. We invested $10.2 billion in 2021. And so KCM feds from Capital Markets went from $230 million to $250 million in the year. I think they were up modestly.  But what you really saw, the big driver, when you add up deployment for us in infrastructure, core private equity growth and real estate equity, so these are the areas that are going to generate on deployment can generate sizable capital markets fees, that deployment for us went 2.3x, went up 2.3x in 2021. And Capital Markets fees cumulatively, similarly, went up 2.3x, went from $150 million to about $350 million.  So it is a -- the dynamic that you have is one where deployment is becoming a lot more broad-based. And again, KCM is not solely going to be based on how we're deploying capital, but it's certainly going to be one of those factors. So I think, really, in that number, as Rob said, you're seeing a real development in the footprint, in the framework of the firm, which is exciting from a management fee standpoint. And it's also exciting from a Capital Markets standpoint.
Robert Lewin: Glenn, one other. I know you had referenced the impact of the Capital Markets environment have on monetizations. I think the big advantage here as we come into 2022 with over $15 billion of embedded revenue that sits in our balance sheet between gross unrealized carry and the embedded gains of our investment portfolio. And I think Q1, and we were off to a good start from the monetization perspective, a good example of that. We don't need straight-line markets up to be able to monetize that $15 billion of embedded revenue, but what we will need is we will need a market environment that does have some stability over periods of time and is flexible in nature. And I think there's going to be areas where we're going to be able to continue to pick our spots in this kind of a market environment and generate monetizations for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.
Gerald O'Hara: Great. Hoping we could get an update just on the strategic investments within your kind of perpetual capital sleeves. Clearly, a nice uptick year-over-year, but perhaps you can talk about some of the drivers of that increase and what we might be able to expect on a go-forward basis.
Craig Larson: I think -- Gerry, it's Craig, very broad-based again. I think when you look at a lot of the core is an example area for us in -- from a perpetual standpoint where we're raising capital. Infrastructure, real estate, as I mentioned, 2 aspects of both Europe and Asia real estate perpetual or capital is going to be perpetual in nature. Global dynamic by itself continues to grow and scale, in addition to that, which is great.  And I think we've, over time, also mentioned these longer-dated strategic-type partnerships. That activity continues. It's multi-asset class. It's again capital where you can have recycling, which can be very valuable from an economic standpoint. You're not going to see that activity from us every quarter. But again, those dialogues continue, and we'll keep you up to date and abreast on that.
Robert Lewin: Gerry, one other thing, if you look at Page 5 on our press release, you can see our perpetual capital. It was up year-on-year over 7x. Now a lot of that is Global Atlantic. But what we don't want to get lost in that slide is that, ex Global Atlantic, our perpetual capital year-on-year was still up 4x versus this time last year. And so there's a lot of momentum across that part of our business.
Gerald O'Hara: Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I appreciate the thoughts around the private wealth channel. But as it relates to the sort of investment, I think last quarter you talked about sort of looking to triple headcount, if my notes are right, and continuing to sort of invest in operations and technology. Can you just perhaps give us an update on how things have progressed there and how we're tracking relative to perhaps where you were last quarter.
Craig Larson: Gerry, it's Craig. So we don't really want to get into the habit, honestly, of giving individual headcount updates on the part of the business and where we are from that. But again, suffice to say, this part is a real strategic priority for us, as we've spoken about. And there's lots of underlying activity and growth. We feel really well positioned and we're very active as it relates to hiring talent on a global basis. I hope that, that gives you a clear sense of the importance for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.
Craig Siegenthaler: So my question is on Global Atlantic. I just want to get an update on your progress to reinvest Global Atlantic's portfolio into KKR-originated product. And also how this could or will impact your blended fee rate as GA reaches your longer-term objective?
Robert Lewin: Craig, it's Rob. That's going to be a multiyear process, and we're going to do it in a very prudent way and make sure that we're rotating GA's balance sheet from quality investments that they had today into opportunities for KKR to be able to invest that capital with a similar or better risk level and at an increased yield. And so that process is taking place. And I would say 11 months in, we're probably in a better place than we thought we'd be at the beginning of the deal. But there's no doubt, as we complete that rotation or we make progress on that rotation, that's going to increase the blended management fee rate in our overall relationship with Global Atlantic. I think that blended management fee rate today is in the mid-teens, and so it definitely has the ability to go up over time based on the rotation that you referenced.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Craig, is that it's going to be a constantly evolving answer to your question because if you think, especially as Global Atlantic pursues block activity, we're bringing on more assets, and then those blocks need to be rotated themselves. So I'm not sure we'll ever reach stasis, frankly. But to Rob's point, we're a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be, and we'll keep you updated. But the block activity has obviously been significant since we signed the deal.
Craig Siegenthaler: And just one other question on that one. What assets or KKR-originated assets are being allocated into Global Atlantic today?
Robert Lewin: Yes. It's a lot across our real estate credit franchise, our private credit franchise, structured finance, asset-based finance. Those are really the big areas of opportunity that we're working together with the GA team.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Brian Mckenna: This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So there's clearly a lot of momentum across the entire platform, and I appreciate all the color on the outlook. But what do you think will be the biggest driver of growth over the next 5 years? And then what products will be the biggest contributor to achieving your FRE and DE targets of $4 plus and $7 plus?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Brian, it's Rob. I'll take the first shot at it. The reality is we've got a lot of confidence across many parts of our business. I'll call out a few, and we talked about them on our prepared remarks.  Asia is a really massive long-term opportunity for us, and we've talked about in the past that we think we could take our Asia business and make it one day as big as our North America business. That's for a couple of reasons. One, we think more than global -- excuse me, half of global growth is going to come out of that region over the next several years. Two, we have a huge head start and competitive advantage versus our competitors. And really, the key for us is to take our leading position there with our leading position across infrastructure, real estate, credit growth equity on a global base in the marriage of those 2 things. And we think that could lead to a lot of growth for us in that part of the world. We've got 5 products, ex private equity, that will be fundraising for capital in Asia in 2022. So that's really a big theme for us. What we're doing across real assets and real estate and infrastructure we think is really exciting. We've talked about our build out of private wealth. So there's a number of different avenues and ways that we have to be able to achieve P&L growth over the next several years.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Brian, it's Scott. Thanks for asking the question, it's kind of fun to answer, honestly. Because we talked about last April, we just got a lot on. We went from 6 to something like 28 investing strategies over the last decade plus, so it's kind of -- the answer to your question, it's hard to be succinct, frankly. We got to scale everything we started, which is a long list of asset classes, real estate, infrastructure, growth, insurance, core. The list goes on and on. We have an opportunity to meaningfully expand our client base. We talked about private wealth a lot today, but there's a lot happening also in the institutional channels. We're creating new growth vectors, so not just the existing 28, but you're going to see more things from us in terms of other ways that we can grow. I think smart M&A is going to continue to play a real role here, not only expanding through Global Atlantic, but we're also looking at other acquisitions, and then having the balance sheet and the currency gives us real tools to accelerate our growth.  So we've got lots of opportunities to scale, and we haven't even hit all of them today. I'm not sure we're going to be able to identify 1 or 2 biggest drivers, I think it's going to come from a lot of different places. And part of the reason you hear such confidence in our voices to double again after we doubled in such a short period of time is everything I just mentioned.
Brian Mckenna: Yes. Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then just 2 quick modeling questions for Rob. How should we think about margin expansion in 2022 relative to 2021? And then is there any updated guidance on the tax rate moving forward?
Robert Lewin: Yes. I'll start with the second one. What we -- our tax rate this year was a little over 17%. And what we said over time is we would expect that to migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s. As it relates to margin, we've talked about operating in the low 60s. In Q4, we were at 63%. In 2021, we were at 63%, so a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be. We're investing a lot back into the firm right now. So I think low 60s is the right level to think about in the near term. But we believe over the medium term that we could take our margins to mid-60s on a sustainable basis if we're able to execute on the revenue opportunity in front of us. And so that's what we're very much focused on as we continue to invest back into the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great. Just back on the retail side. Of the $50 billion in private wealth assets right now, are you able to break that out between what you would call democratized products? I know those are still very much in development but just to try to get a sense of how you're thinking about that fundraising in retail from new products. Scott, you mentioned obviously some products on the yield side gaining attention. Maybe just a flavor of that growth path of that 10% to 20% to 30%to 50%. Maybe even just in the next 1 to 2 years, what kind of AUM you think you could raise in new democratized products in retail? And then to what extent would there be significant placement fees attached with the retail side of that?
Craig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Look, in terms of where we are today, we have 3 broad democratized solutions that are on a bunch of different platforms, in addition to bespoke solutions that are tailored for individual platforms.  To your first question, we have about $5 billion of AUM across that family, if you will. And we do believe over time that we'll have democratized products really across all of our asset classes. And alongside of that, we're going to continue to invest in sales, marketing, data, digital talent, et cetera. And alongside of where we are today, we do expect we'll see these products launched on additional platforms over the course of the year which will be additive to all of this.  So it feels like, collectively, we're off to a great start. It still feels to us like we're in the earliest stages. One of those products that seems to be taking or having a lot of mind share, we only began accepting capital in June, it's off to a great start. It's pressed in the real estate business.  So it just feels like we have a lot of momentum, which is really exciting for us. We don't have any breakdown of democratized products for you in terms of where we think that number could grow. There's certainly lots of data points out there that highlight the opportunity. And again, just given the investment we have, the brand investment performance, we think we're really well positioned to be a big winner in a massive end market.
Brian Bedell: Fair enough. And then just on the follow-up, just the timing of a couple of things. The -- your expectation of the $38 billion that's not earning management fees now. Over what time frame do you expect the rest of that to move into fee-paying AUM? And then the dry powder also, $112 billion, is almost double what it was 6 quarters ago. As you raise product, should we be thinking of that deploying that dry powder running down in terms of how you're seeing opportunities to invest that you concerned that within the call? Or is it possible that, that dry powder will continue to build given your fundraising?
Robert Lewin: Brian, it's Rob. So on your -- on the first part of your question, I'd say in that $38 billion, I mean, it's a mix of different things. In some cases, it's some investment products where the fee turns on when you invest it, and some of those have lives of 3, 4, 5 years from an investment period perspective. And so I think about that on a blended basis of about 3 years.  And some of the other products, it's just capital we've raised and funds that we haven't yet turned on. And so we would think that, that's more in the next 3-, 6-ish month time frame. So I think on a blended basis, a couple of years overall feels like a reasonable assumption for that $38 billion, maybe a little bit inside of that.  And then as it relates to the dry powder, it's a tough question to answer. It is really a function of how active the investment environment is, coupled with our fundraising activity. And so I think what you've heard from us a number of times on this call is the excitement we have for future fundraising. At the same time, in these volatile markets, we think the opportunity for us to be leaning it from an investment perspective might get more interesting. And so I think it will just be a balance of those 2 things. Hard to be prescriptive about where that number goes over the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: I wanted to circle back to a comment Scott had made. Scott, you had mentioned that the quantum of opportunity was greater than anticipated. I'd just be curious to hear your perspectives on why that's been the case. What's changed across the industry over the past 12 to 18 months? And as you look forward, are there any sort of risk to the outlook that you're paying attention to, either regulatory-wise? Clearly, there's been some movement there or on the macro front. Just curious your perspectives there.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Michael. Yes, I think part of it is -- let me take it back to kind of the strategy that we laid out last April, which is that we said that we only wanted to be in businesses where we thought we already were or could get to be top 3 in the world. And we wanted to stay focused in those areas. And I think part of the reason you hear us saying now that we think the quantum of the opportunity is greater than we anticipated is the end markets that we're facing off against are growing quite rapidly. And we're finding investor appetite, not only from the traditional sources, but new sources, are increasing faster than we'd anticipated.  So end markets are growing very quickly, and more and more people are investing in what we do. And so that's kind of part one to the answer to your question as to why the quantum is greater than we'd anticipated. We already expected growth. I think it's a bit more than we expected.  The other thing I'd say is that we are approaching top 3 faster than we'd anticipated in some of these asset classes. And a lot of that's on the back of good investment performance and building like and trust with a broader client base. And so the end opportunity is bigger than probably we thought, and we're getting there more rapidly than we thought. And so the definition of top 3 in terms of what that means in terms of magnitude of AUM, revenue, profitability is, therefore, bigger than what we'd anticipated probably 12, 18 months ago.  The risks I think are pretty straightforward. We've got to execute. It's a pretty straightforward business when you back up. If you have strong investment performance and you have products that clients want to invest in and they like you and they trust your judgment and you perform for them through a cycle, it's very straightforward to scale. So a lot of the risks, and this is one of the reasons we like our business so much, it's on us. We've got execution in front of us. We just need to perform. And I think a big part of the reason you've seen us scaling so rapidly is we've had really strong investment performance at the same time that we've been operationalizing a broader client base. And we do see a significant amount of running room on both of those topics.  So I know there's been a couple of questions today about market volatility, and it's been a little more bumpy at the beginning of this year than what we saw last. But from our standpoint, that tends to be quite good news. We've talked about the $112 billion of dry powder, if we can invest into volatility, that tends to create long-term opportunity for us in terms of incremental revenue and profit down the road. So a long way of saying we really like the way we're positioned right now. Low volatility is probably good for our business long term, and the opportunity ahead is significant.
Michael Cyprys: And just on the regulatory point, just any sort of thoughts there around potential for regulatory changes, enhanced transparency around fees, et cetera?
Scott Nuttall: Look, I think the level of regulatory scrutiny of our space is probably a positive for larger players that are more institutionalized. And so there's aspects of how the regulatory environment is developed that I think the barriers to entry in our space have gone up, and that's good for incumbent players. So nothing that we see that I would call out today. Our job is to react to what the regulators talk to us about. And so far, we actually think it's been long term helpful to our business.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And just a quick cleanup question for Rob, if I could. Just hoping you might be able to update us on the amount of capital that was invested off the balance sheet in '21 and the realizations as well off the balance sheet in 2021 and how that compared to 2020, if you have that.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Activity was certainly up across the board, Mike. We monetized just over $3 billion of the balance sheet in 2021. And we deployed about $3.7 billion. That deployment does not include Global Atlantic. So if you include Global Atlantic in that number, we'd be a little bit below $7 billion of deployment for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities.
Finian O'Shea: To follow on the insurance topic, are you able to touch on what you're seeing on the regulatory agenda, focusing more on structured products and alternative asset manager affiliates and if you see any major impact to the product that you and your peers are providing to insurance clients?
Robert Lewin: Thanks for the question. It's a topical one, and we're spending a lot of time internally focused on it. Part of the answer is similar to the answer Scott just gave from a regulatory -- overall regulatory environment perspective. I'd say the insurance industry, just like other financial services industries, is going through a period of change. In general, the industry is getting more sophisticated, and we think that is ultimately a good thing for policyholders. And so as a result of that, we think it's entirely appropriate for regulators to adapt as the industry evolves, and we think smart regulation is a good thing for the industry overall.  And so as it relates to Global Atlantic specifically, we've got really close and transparent relationships with all of our regulators. We know they are working to gather information and industry feedback. And beyond that, there's really not a lot that we can comment on. All that we can say is that we don't anticipate really any major change to our core business model, which is investing thoughtfully behind the long-term promises that we're making as an institution to policyholders. I appreciate the question, and it is a topical one.
Operator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Rufus Hone with Bank of Montreal.
Rufus Hone: Great. Had one on Global Atlantic. Clearly, strong AUM and earnings growth since the acquisition, and I was curious if you anticipate any change in the appetite for block transactions and on your regular quarterly inflows as interest rates start to rise. Any details there would be helpful.
Robert Lewin: Yes. So no change in our appetite. It's been an area of very meaningful and we think very smart growth that Global Atlantic has had over the past 12 months. I would say the space around block transactions, I'm sure, as you noted, has become a little bit more competitive. But we think with our capital base, quality of our management team, the relationships we have and really our systems and processes, they position us all to compete really effectively for block transactions. I think a big reason why Global Atlantic partnered up with KKR, in addition to that, was our capabilities on the asset management side and our ability to rotate assets in these blocks into KKR-originated product. And so when you combine all of that, we think we're really well positioned. No change in appetite, and the institutional part of GA's business will continue to be a big growth driver for them going forward.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Larson for any final comments.
Craig Larson: We would just really like to thank everybody for your interest in KKR, and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Take care. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our co-CEO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO.  We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And as a reminder, we report our segment numbers on an adjusted share basis.  This call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings and our earnings release for cautionary factors related to these statements.  Now turning to our results. We're pleased to be reporting another very strong quarter with fee-related earnings per share of $0.60 and after-tax distributable earnings of $1.05 per share. Both of these figures are as high as we've ever reported. Building on the success we've had in fundraising, management fees increased 16% from just last quarter, and management fees are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2020 to $559 million. This growth is the key driver behind the 60% increase in our fee-related earnings per share that you see on a year-over-year basis. Book value per share for the quarter came in at $28.06, up 38% from 1 year ago.  And turning to fundraising. We continue to have a great deal of momentum. New capital raised in the quarter totaled $28 billion organically, bringing the year-to-date figure to $102 billion. Last year, in 2020, for the full year, we raised $44 billion, and that was a record year for KKR. So over the first 9 months of 2021, we've raised over 2x what we raised for all of last year, and that's with an active pipeline of fundraising initiatives as we look forward.  Focusing on the $28 billion raised in the third quarter, we'd highlight 2 things. First, in private markets, 40% of the capital raised in the quarter came from our real estate business. We held the final close of our Americas Real Estate Fund. REPA III is more than 2x larger than its predecessor, and total AUM across the real estate platform now totals $36 billion. And Global Atlantic was particularly active with block activity helping add $14 million of new capital, largely in public markets.  And alongside all of this fundraising, we're finding interesting opportunities to invest. We deployed a record $15 billion into private market strategies into the quarter, as well as $10 billion in public markets. This brings our total deployment for the quarter to a record $24 billion and on a year-to-date basis to $50 billion. One of the key drivers here is the continued scaling of our infrastructure and real estate platforms. Year-to-date, real assets deployment is a little more than half of total deployment in private markets. If we look back in 2020, real assets comprised 25% of private markets deployment. So as real assets deployment is scaling, private markets deployment is increasing and is becoming more diversified. In public markets, the scale of our credit platform grew meaningfully before the Global Atlantic acquisition, and that growth has continued after GA. So similarly, you're seeing a step-up in deployment here with the increase driven by both direct corporate origination as well as in asset-based finance.  To give you a sense, last year, total private and opportunistic credit deployment was a little over $10 billion. Through the first 9 months of 2021, that has increased to $23 billion. So deployment has more than doubled, and we're only 9 months into the year.  Now I'll turn the call over to Rob to walk you through some additional details. Rob?
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Just as we continue to see strength in the fundraising and deployment front, our funds continue to generate really strong relative investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds increased by 11% in the quarter and 79% over the LTM period, while the entire PE portfolio appreciated 9% and 52%, respectively.  In real assets, our opportunistic real estate state funds increased by 14% in the quarter and 29% over the LTM. Infrastructure continues to perform really well, up 4% in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months. And on the public markets side, our leverage and alternative credit funds increased by 1% and 2% in the quarter, respectively, with continued performance over the LTM, up 11% and 26%.  The combination of strong investment performance, as well as the capital raising that Craig just went through, has yielded a really robust acceleration of our AUM, which now totals $459 billion, and our fee-paying AUM is $349 billion. That's up 7% and 9%, respectively, versus just last quarter. When comparing our AUM and fee paying AUM relative to this time last year, they're both up, close to 100%. And importantly, much of this AUM is now either perpetual capital or in long-dated partnerships. Just 9 months ago, this number was $55 billion. It's now $205 billion out of our almost $460 billion of AUM. You can see this growth and the transformational change in the composition of our AUM on Page 16 of the earnings release.  And finally, as it relates to our capital base, we currently have $38 billion of committed capital that comes online and becomes fee paying at a weighted average rate of over 100 basis points when the capital is either invested or enters its investment period.  Now turning to our quarterly P&L. Our management fees increased over 50% this quarter versus the same time last year. As we signaled on last quarter's call, management fee growth was driven by a combination of new capital raised and various newer funds hitting their run rate. Net transaction monitoring fees were primarily driven by our capital markets franchise, which saw a continued strength this quarter and were up 24% versus the same quarter in 2020. And over the last 12 months, our capital markets transaction fees have totaled $720 million, which is 42% higher than the average during the 2018 to 2020 time period.  The growth in the platform is stemming from many of the expansion areas that we touched on at our April Investor Day, including our build-out of real asset, core PE and third-party coverage, which have all generated meaningful market share gains. We remain really constructive around the future growth of this business. This all brings us to fee-related earnings of $530 million for the quarter, which is up 63% versus Q3 2020. On a per-share basis, our FRE is $2.02 over the last 12 months.  Moving on to realizations. Realized performance income came in at $433 million for the quarter driven by exits in Bountiful, Ingersoll-Rand and Academy. Realized investment income totaled $448 million for the quarter driven by additional exits in Mr. Cooper and Flutter.  Even with these very strong monetization figures, we have still seen healthy gains in both our unrealized carried interest and the embedded gains from our balance sheet investments. Gross unrealized carried interest increased to $8.5 billion, while our embedded gains on investments increased to $7.1 billion. That's almost $16 billion of embedded revenue, which has grown over 70% since the start of the year, and that's all happened while we've been generating record levels of realizations.  Coming back to our P&L. Our asset management operating earnings were a bit north of $1 billion for the quarter, which is up 80% from the same quarter last year. And our insurance segment operating earnings totaled $115 million, largely driven by strong core operating performance at Global Atlantic, together with the sale of 2 strategic investments that helped bolster net investment income.  In total, our after-tax distributable earnings per share came in at $1.05 for the quarter and $3.47 for the LTM period. Both numbers are up 100% and 79%, respectively, versus the prior period.  Turning to our balance sheet. Book value per share came in at $28.06, which was up 38% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong investment performance. It's worth noting that our result for this quarter includes an $0.80 increase to our deferred tax liability associated with the corporate reorganization that we announced last month and that we expect to close next year.  In summary, we are really doing all the things that matter most for our business to perform at a high level and to ensure that we're set up well for the future. We keep coming back to these 5 things and really do believe we are optimizing for outcomes across the board. Number one, we are sourcing unique investment opportunities in which to put our capital to work. Our year-to-date deployment is up 2.5x. Our investment performance has been exceptionally strong, both on an absolute basis and relative to many of our peers. Because of this performance, our monetization opportunities have been abundant, and we have delivered substantial distributions to our clients and record levels of monetization for our shareholders. And these first 3 points all enable us to have the fundraising successes we have achieved. $100-plus billion of year-to-date flows is the proof point, and this sets us up incredibly well for the future.  And finally, we have conviction that our business model allows us to generate greater financial outcomes. And I think you're clearly seeing that flow through our P&L.  We have also talked on these calls and on Investor Days about inflection points. Our overall business has seen a fundamental shift, an inflection point, in its operating level. Beyond our distributable earnings being up approximately 2x since this time last year, all of our forward indicators are in the best shape they've ever been in. AUM is up 2x. Year-to-date fundraising is up 3x, and the embedded gains in our balance sheet have increased by approximately 300% in just the last year. We really couldn't be any more excited about the future.  And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Craig and Rob did a nice job walking through our numbers, which were strong again this quarter. So I'm going to spend my time on a few strategic areas of focus and give you our sense for how we're progressing.  The first is perpetual and long-dated strategic capital. As you know, we are big believers in the power of compounding in all aspects of our business, including AUM. The more capital we can attract, that is perpetual or recycles, the faster we expect our AUM will scale and compound over the long term. A year ago, perpetual and strategic capital was $49 billion, 21% of our total AUM. Today, that number is $205 billion or 45%, $49 billion to $205 billion in 1 year. So we've seen over a 4x increase in 12 months, and we are nowhere near done. We have a lot of new ideas and efforts to generate even more perpetual capital going forward.  The second big strategic focus area is insurance. As you know, Global Atlantic advance materially in this area. GA assets have grown from $75 billion a year ago to $120 billion at the end of Q3, a 60% increase. In addition, we have seen our AUM from third-party insurance clients increased from $33 billion a year ago to $48 billion today, an increase of 45%. Putting GA and third party together, our insurance AUM has grown from $108 billion pro forma for GA to $167 billion in a year or an increase of 55%. While we're pleased with the progress, keep in mind, we only closed the GA deal in February of this year and see a lot more opportunity for significant growth in insurance.  The third area of focus is private wealth. As you know, individual investors have been 10% to 20% of the capital we've raised the last few years. We believe that with the investments we're making, combined with our brand and performance, that number will ramp to 30% to 50% of the capital we raised over the next several years. We are investing in sales, marketing, data and digital talent, and we are creating more democratized products that are relevant for a wide number of individual investors. This is a big opportunity for us, and we think we're incredibly well positioned.  So long story short, the Q3 numbers are strong, but they tell only a small part of the story of what's happening at the firm. These initiatives and others give us confidence we can more than double KKR again over the next 5-or-so years, including our fee-related earnings, where we see a clear path from the $2 of FRE per share we've achieved over the last 12 months to an excess of $4 over that time frame. So while recent growth has been exciting, we see a lot more ahead. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein: Great. So maybe we'll pick up, Scott, on where you left off with doubling the business again and growing FRE to north of $4 a share. As you go through the kind of key initiatives that you outlined, whether it's perpetual capital insurance or private wealth, can we zone in on private wealth just maybe a little bit more? As you think about the ramp to 30% to 50% of kind of flows from that channel, what is sort of the key product and maybe key distribution partnerships that you're considering? Obviously, we have KREST out there, so would be good to get an update on that. But how else are you thinking about tackling this part of the market?
Craig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Thanks for asking about -- taking a step back, we think the opportunity within private wealth to introduce tailored democratized products really is massive, and we think we're incredibly well positioned.  Now to review, we have 3 broad solutions that are on multiple platforms as well as bespoke solutions that are tailored for individual platforms. And in total, we've raised about $2 billion year-to-date. So we're raising a couple of hundred million a month. So we're pleased with our first steps here. We're just getting started, as you know, and we're focused on ramping. So I thought maybe it made sense to touch on the democratized parts initially as it relates broadly to the ramping and the momentum that we have.  Scott or Rob, do you want to add on?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Just a couple of things I'd add, Alex. I appreciate the question. As Craig mentioned, today, the products that we have, we put in this democratized category, focus on credit, real estate, private equity. And we have a number of others that we're working on across different asset classes.  In addition to those that I'd put more into kind of the '40 Act, fully democratized zone. We also have a number of our funds that we actually sell through private wealth platforms, which is another big contributor. And in the past, as I mentioned, it's been about 10% to 20% of the total money we've raised has been from that individual investor channel, broadly defined. I think what Craig mentioned is really critical. Though it is still early, we see a lot of upside here. That's why we're guiding you that we think that 10% to 20% number will move up to 30% to 50% over time, and it's an area for us that -- where we see a significant amount of growth ahead. In addition to building our own team, which we continue to expand and invest in, we are creating partnerships, to your point, with external managers. We'll have more to share with you on that front over time, but we're creating partnerships with wealth platforms around the world, in addition to building our own team.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.
William Katz: Okay. Congrats, Scott, on promotion. Just coming back to maybe your commentary and I think embedded in part of Alex's question. But can you expand a little bit on a lot more to do like yet on perpetual capital? Is that just retail? Are there other opportunities out there to continue to scale that more annuitized business opportunity?
Scott Nuttall: Happy to, Bill, and I appreciate the kind words. I think we see it across a number of different aspects of our business. There's the institutional channel. I think there's a lot of focus lately for good reason on private wealth, but we're continuing to invest in the build-out of our institutional capabilities as well. So we've seen a 40% increase, just as an example, there and headcount focused on institutional fundraising. So I think you're going to see it institutionally where we're continuing to talk to partners about long-dated partnerships, some with recycling. So that's going to be part of the answer to your question.  Part of it, of course, will be what we just talked about in terms of private wealth in the individual investor. Part of it will be growing in insurance where we see opportunities all around the world. And then we're working on new structures and new designs where we could actually elongate our -- the duration of our capital base even further to a variety of different channels.  So a bunch of different opportunities all across the world, and I think you'll continue to hear us talk about this going forward. So the $49 billion to $205 billion is great progress, but we expect to continue to make great progress here going forward.
William Katz: Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Rob. So I appreciate the sort of the broad guidance of on pace to sort of double FRE over the next few years, but it seems like your management fees are pacing even more quickly than maybe the last set of guidance. Can you just level set where we are in terms of pacing to the previous goal? And then how -- against ongoing capital raising, how that might play through over 2022?
Robert Lewin: Yes, sure. Bill, thanks for the question. I think, in retrospect, I think it's fair that some of the historical guidance we gave over the last 6 to 12 months is on the conservative side. But at the same time, if you look, our business has so much more momentum today than it did, even 6 or 12 months ago. And you could look at how we're performing in our different fundraises globally, all or pretty much all well ahead of expectations. The assets we have from Global Atlantic are far ahead of where we expected them to be. The momentum in our capital markets business is as good as it's ever been. And the last piece of it, less on fees, but I think also really pertinent to the discussion of growth going forward is we now have $16 billion of unrealized revenue or close to that on our balance sheet.  And so if you come back to your question around where growth can go from here, I think we should pause on the $100 billion of capital that we've raised year-to-date. If you think about it, only a very small percentage of the revenue and economics that we expect from this capital has hit our P&L so far in 2021. The vast majority of it is going to be in 2022 and beyond.  And the other neat point on the $100 billion of AUM that we've raised is that 50% of it has come from strategies that we weren't even in 5 years ago. So the ability to scale from there on that piece of the capital base, we think, is very real as well.  So maybe bringing that back full circle to where you were going and what we expect of ourselves, while our earnings base today is at a higher level than we expected 6, 12 months ago, as Scott mentioned earlier, we still have every expectation that if we execute really well going forward that we can more than double our FRE off of this higher base.  And likewise, looking at the full picture of our P&L, even off the higher distributable earnings number, the $3.50 or so that we've delivered over the LTM period, I also think we've got clear line of sight in that same period of time, the strong execution to double that to $7 plus. And so hopefully, that gives you a broader picture for how we're thinking about growth across the platform, Bill.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr: One quick one. There's a transaction or 2 in the secondary space lately. It feels like a strategic need. For as great as you're doing, you can do greater. Curious on what your plans are at this point for organic versus inorganic build in that area.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Glenn. Nothing new to report today. We continue to assess whether there's someone that we could partner with or buy all or a meaningful portion of or whether we should build our own. As we've talked about in the past, the secondary and co-invest space is adjacent to a lot of what we do. It's something we think we could be a value-added partner to somebody or build something truly distinctive. So it's not a have to do, but it is something that we continue to spend time on. Nothing new to share with you today however, but we're continuing to spend time there.
Glenn Schorr: Okay. Maybe we could follow up on. You teased us in the past with a comment about the Asia franchise, at some point, being as big as the Americas. Maybe you could break down a little bit more in terms of retail, institutional and which asset classes might be -- what might we expect to see have more growth in the next couple of years as opposed to the someday.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Glenn, it's Rob. Clearly, we've got a first-rate private equity franchise in Asia, a $15 billion fund, probably somewhere around close to double the size of our next biggest competitor in the region. The growth opportunity from here continues to be in private equity. We think it's still very much an under-addressed private equity alternatives market.  But really, it's the marriage between the best-in-class teams we have across 8 offices in Asia and what we do in the private equity side with the global capabilities that we're building up in areas like real estate, infrastructure, credit, growth equity, what we're doing in capital markets. We think the marriage of those 2 things with our market-leading position will create a bunch of growth going forward for us in that part of the world where we've got a real competitive advantage and think a real moat around the business franchise that we've built so far. And for our competitors to catch up requires a lot of investment.  So we feel really good about how we're situated. And we continue to believe that, over time, our Asia Pac business can be as big as our U.S. business one day.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.
Robert Lee: Great. Scott, also, congrats on the promotion. Just really maybe is a little bit of a riff on Glenn's question. But as he mentioned, there's a lot of action in the secondaries market, like M&A, but you've talked about your CPS business as being a replacement for that. Could you maybe update us on that initiative and how you see that kind of progressing as maybe a replacement for secondaries or fund to funds business?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Happy to take it, Rob, and thanks for the congrats. Yes. So CPS, and we haven't talked about it in a while, but it stands for customized portfolio solutions. So this is a team and a business that we built on the back of the observation that a number of institutional investors were trying to get exposure to private equity, in particular, but did not have a big team to get after that and wanted a bit of an outsourced solution and partner to try to build a more diversified pool of private equity exposures.  And so the team has built a business which has a combination of KKR funds and co-invest. And third party, we think best-in-class private equity partners also investing in their funds and looking at their co-investment.  And so the business has continued to perform really quite nicely. It's now about $6 billion of AUM and has been quietly a top quartile performer. And we'll continue to scale that business, and we're getting more traction with investors around the world. So it's an opportunity for upside and a real nice performer for us that we think will continue to get bigger over time, and we'll keep you posted.
Robert Lee: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, going to the inevitable question, I guess, on capital management. So I mean, you've got a huge amount of embedded gains on the balance sheet from your own investments, could carry businesses growing at a higher rate. Is there -- or do you think about, call it, a tipping point where, hey, we've got enough kind of cash generation that we can more than amply fulfill our capital needs and growth requirements and maybe start shifting towards somewhat greater return of capital, whether it's a little bit higher dividend payout or share buyback or something? Do you feel like that tipping point may be approaching the next couple of years?
Robert Lewin: Yes. I'll start off, Rob, and I'm sure Scott will jump in as well. I think the most important thing to any capital allocation framework is to make sure that you're consistent. And our approach to capital allocation has always been very much ROE based. And so we're always going to start that with what's an appropriate level of capital return to our shareholders and balancing that with investment back into KKR growth, assuming that it's able to achieve compelling ROEs. So let's take those in order.  We've said that we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy on an annual basis. We'll do that in Q1 next year. But what we've said is we'd look to grow that consistently over time. We want to continue to be a buyer of KKR stock. We feel really good about our body of work here over the last 5, 6 years. We've repurchased or retired close to 80 million shares. It's almost 10% of our outstanding shares today, close to 15% of our free float. We'd look to continue to do that going forward, and we're going to look to invest back into KKR for growth.  And I do think one of the areas of core competency that we do have is to be able to move capital around to the highest ROE opportunity. And if we're not finding that inside of the KKR platform, then we'd certainly evaluate greater returns of capital to shareholders through one of the first 2 buckets. That's really how we're going to approach it. And I think probably the most important point of any here is we do this in a really aligned way. The KKR employees are, as a group, the largest shareholder in KKR. And so we -- as we think about how to allocate our capital base, obviously, the mindset there comes from a very aligned perspective.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add is the balance sheet, if you really step back and look at how we -- it has allowed us to grow our fee-related earnings a lot faster, whether it's seeding new businesses. And as a reminder, 10 years ago, we were in 6 investing businesses, and now we're in 28. The balance sheet has clearly accelerated the growth of what we're trying to do in terms of the organic build.  Our capital markets business, as you know, we operate in a capital-light model, but we've used the balance sheet to be able to scale the growth of capital markets in a meaningful way and perhaps, even more powerfully, M&A. If you think about Marshall Wace and our partnership there, if you think about Global Atlantic, we've been able to use the balance sheet to really convert balance sheet earnings into fee-related earnings and TDE.  And so we view it, Rob, as a strategic weapon. So you'll continue to see us use it that way and think of it that way. And then to Rob's point, we'll continue to reassess the dividend level and buybacks and try to get the balance as right we can with the vantage point of being the largest shareholder.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great. Congrats, Scott. Just maybe just go back to the fundraising, obviously way ahead of schedule here compared with your Investor Day. And just wanted to get a sense of -- for 2022 as we move into that year, is it even possible for that to be as successful on a fundraising standpoint versus '21 if we ignore insurance blocks? And what would be some of the drivers given you've raised your flag -- a couple of your flagships already?
Craig Larson: Brian, it's Craig. Why don't I start? Thanks for the question. We don't have any updated fundraising guidance for 2022, but let me try and help frame things. I think really what you're seeing in this quarter is kind of interesting in this way is what you're seeing is the continued scaling of businesses and the increased diversification across the firm.  7 or 8 years ago, if we reported one of the strongest fundraising quarters in our history, it would have meant we had a big fundraising event in private equity. And so today, we're reporting an excellent new capital raise figure. New capital raised in Q3 is the second highest quarterly figure we reported in our history, and over 90% of that is coming from strategies outside of traditional private equity. So in private markets, half the capital was raised in infrastructure and real estate, as we talked about it. We have all these new initiatives. As Rob had mentioned, 50% of the capital year-to-date being raised from areas that didn't even exist within the framework of the firm 5 years ago. In Global Atlantic, as you mentioned, again, AUM meaningfully above where we would have ever expected it would have been at the time of announcement. And when you think of huge addressable market opportunities like we've touched on with these democratized products, that's all on the come.  So we don't have an updated figure for next year, but it just continues to feel like there's real momentum, and we're really well positioned, which is exciting.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Brian, is, look, as Craig said, we got a lot of ways to win now. The firm is really scaling and diversifying. Last time I counted out what we have coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months, it's something like 27 different line items. So there's lots of different products in the market, and that's away from Global Atlantic.
Brian Bedell: Yes. No. That's it. It's incredibly powerful. But maybe as we think about that march towards $4 of FRE, if you could comment on a couple of areas, in addition to your traditional ones, and that being the -- on the retail side, that moved into 30% to 50%. Do you see that as an incrementally positive growth driver to that FRE target over and above what your traditional plan is in the institutional channels?  And then I guess sort of same question on the capital markets business. I mean, that's had -- moves up and down, of course, but it's had some pretty good secular growth. And is that also a substantial component to that $4?
Scott Nuttall: I think it's any more substantial than it would be today, on the second question. And on the first question, look, I think the opportunities we see in private wealth give us that much more confidence that it's in excess of $4 in 5-or-so years. And I think the in excess of is something you should focus on, and we'll try to do better than $4. But I think retail, private wealth opportunity gives us more confidence we have an opportunity to continue to outperform expectations.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.
Gerald O'Hara: Great. Seeing obviously the three block transactions in the quarter is encouraging, but perhaps you could give us just a little bit of sense on what the kind of competitive dynamics are within that insurance and annuity business from your end.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Gerry. It's Scott. Look, it is a competitive environment, and we see -- we have competition across everything that we do. We have a lot of smart competitors. They tend to be responsible, smart competitors, and so we've been able to pick our spots and lean in on opportunities where we think we have a clear competitive advantage. And we've been really pleased with the progress we've been able to make.  As I've mentioned in the past, one of the key reasons that we wanted to create the partnership with Global Atlantic is the strength of the management team. And they have really built really nice relationships all around the world with different counterparties, and that's allowed us to lean into these blocks. And so yes, there's been a significant flow of block activity. We expect it will continue. We expect it will be competitive, and we expect we'll continue to win our share.
Gerald O'Hara: Fair enough. And perhaps one for Rob. I know we're still kind of early days here in the fourth quarter. But if you might be able to give us any sort of update or line of sight into 4Q monetization activity, that would, as always, be appreciated.
Robert Lewin: Yes. No problem, Gerry. You're right. We're early in the quarter, but we already have really good visibility into Q4 and into record levels, I think, of monetization activity, and we will turn into revenue. Size of now, that figure is north of $1 billion. So that's collectively across both our performance and investment income. As a reminder, this is going to be from deals that are either already closed today or have been signed up and we expect to close in Q4. I'd also note that for this quarter, for Q4, this figure also includes revenue from incentive fees that have already been booked through our hedge fund partnerships.  In terms of how that breaks down from a split perspective, so you could think about flow-through to profitability, I would say it's probably slightly weighted towards carried interest right now relative to both investment income as well as the performance income that comes from our hedge fund partnerships. If you recall, the latter has the same 10% to 20% comp load as our investment income. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor of what's ahead in Q4. But again, another strong monetization quarter for us.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Brian Mckenna: This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So just to follow up on realization activity, so you have about $5 billion of net unrealized carried interest and $7 billion of embedded gains on the balance sheet. So assuming the capital markets remain open and business trends continue to be healthy, how quickly do you think you can work through this pipeline of realizations over time?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Brian, it's a good question, obviously. And I -- we're going to be balanced. And what you've seen so far in 2021 is while we've had record levels -- year-to-date, I believe our monetizations and our revenue from monetizations is better than any year we've had for a full year. And even through that period of time, we've still grown our embedded gains and unrealized gains in our balance sheet. I think that comes from investment performance. So we can continue to generate strong investment performance in the future, which we feel good about, especially given the portfolio construction that we have in place. we think we'll continue to be able to generate healthy levels of monetizations and keep the pipeline for future years in place.  But obviously, a lot of it comes down to execution, and it's really hard to forecast from here. But I think if you look back at our -- really 2020, even a volatile period of time in 2021, you've seen a consistent level of monetizations even as our unrealized gains and embedded gains in our balance sheet have grown.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, as you heard Rob referenced before, that, in addition to kind of having confidence, we can at least double fee-related earnings in the next 5-or-so years. We think we can do the same with distributable earnings per share. And obviously, having a line of sight that we do in terms of embedded value in both carry and balance sheet gains is part of the reason we have that confidence. But to Rob's point, we'll continue to monetize. And hopefully, we'll continue to replenish with other unrealized gains and other investments perform.
Brian Mckenna: Great. And then just on the FRE margin, that stepped up nicely in the quarter to about 65% from 62% in the first half of 2021. So how should we think about the FRE margin moving forward? Is that 65% a good place to be?
Robert Lewin: Brian, what we've talked about historically is probably a low 60s FRE margin. We were 61% last year. Year-to-date, even with a solid Q3, we're about 63%, so kind of in line where we thought we'd be. What we've also flagged is we intend to continue to invest across technology, distribution and marketing. And so you could see our OpEx line ticking up a bit. But the goal going forward over the next number of years is to be at a place where we're sustainably generating mid-60s types of FRE margins. But I think the guidance going forward will continue to be in that low 60% range. And hopefully, there will be periods of time where that can go up and ultimately be in a place where we're more sustainably generating those types of margins that are in the mid-60s.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: It's Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to follow up on the private wealth opportunity. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the investments you're making in sales, marketing, distribution, digital distribution, if you could just elaborate a little bit on that. How large is the sales team today? Where do you think that can be over the next couple of years? And how do you think about buy versus build versus rent?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of the investment that we're making, first, the investment we're making is in headcount. So the team, kind of probably 18-plus months ago, it was probably around 10 people. It's now pushing 40. I would expect that number will likely triple or so again from here over the relatively near term. So we'll continue to build the focused private wealth team out, including marketing. That's kind of investment 1.  Investment 2 will be in all things tech and operations, around making sure that we're able to service the private wealth client in a best-in-class way. So we're continuing to make investments there. You heard Rob referenced some investments we're going to continue to make in technology. Some of that will be around the space. But those are the 2 predominant, in addition to what I talked about before, which is product development.  In terms of buy versus build versus rent, we are clearly building, and we're doing some renting as we sit here today. And we are, as part of our corporate development efforts, assessing whether there's anything that could make sense to buy. But right now, it is build and rent and create partnerships, and we'll let you know if we find anything that we think is interesting enough to move into the buy category.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Mike, just one quick thing to add on. As we think about headcount growth in SaaS space or really across the firm, it's important to note that we would expect to be able to operate within our stated comp range on fees in the 20% to 25% range. And so even with increased heads, I wouldn't expect that to impact our margins.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up, if I could, just around capital deployment. Clearly, a very strong quarter, $8 billion deployed across infrastructure and real estate. In particular, I thought stood out, that's $24 billion or so annualized pace there. Just can you talk a little bit about the actions that you're taking to increase deployment capacity within your real assets business in terms of the actions you've taken to get to this level? And as you look out over the next couple of years, where would you like to see that deployment pace and capacity be in, say, 3 or 5 years? And what are the actions you need to take in order for that to be materially higher from where it is today?
Craig Larson: Mike, it's Craig. Why don't I start, just give you some facts around deployment? And I expect Scott will add on as it relates to investments for tomorrow. And I'm glad you asked about it. Honestly, we probably haven't talked about deployment as much detail as we should. As you note, we've continued to be really active. Year-to-date -- or in the quarter, $15 billion. Year-to-date, we're at -- we're approaching $30 billion. So when you look at that deployment figure through 9 months, that's already meaningfully above where we were in 2020, and that was a record year for us. So deployments have been really healthy.  I think a couple of thoughts on that, first, relates back to that thought of diversification. And as you noted, again, the strength we've seen in real assets with that amount in the quarter being pretty equally split between our real estate business and infrastructure. And if you contrast that with 2019 and 2020, again, this quarter, those businesses were about 60% of deployment in private markets. Combined, they were about 25% in 2019 and 2020. So as those businesses have scaled, as we've entered new asset classes like core -- and again, it's interesting when you think of core -- real estate core infrastructure, those end markets are larger in size than opportunistic.  So again, that addressable market for us has been increasing. You're seeing that in deployment. Core PE had its actually most active deployment quarter for us in the year. So while these businesses are growing and scaling, you're seeing that in terms of deployment.  I think one other point that's just interesting as it relates to private equity, we're being disciplined. So the level of activity is exceptionally high. There's a ton of flow. But really, what you've seen in the numbers is we're being disciplined, and we're drawing lines and really looking to pick our spots. So despite the overall healthy amount of deployment, year-to-date, private equity deployment is actually on pace to be below that in 2020.  And in public markets, again, the credit platform was growing materially before GA, continues to scale post GA. So that's driving a real step-up in deployment. That's both in terms of corporate origination as well as in asset-based finance.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. No. It's a great question, Mike. I mean, we do see a real opportunity to meaningfully expand these real estate and infrastructure platforms. As you know, both of those were more or less created over the course of the last 10 to 12 years. These are very large end markets and that there's a significant amount of client interest in all things real assets. If you have yield and inflation protection, which these asset classes do, you've got a real significant investor appetite right now.  There's probably 5 things I'd point to. One is we're just, regular way, scaling of the more opportunistic strategies. So if you think about it, it wasn't that long ago, we were an infrastructure, one, how that platform has scaled materially from $1 billion to -- in the teens per fund, so big opportunity as we continue to scale the opportunistic platform.  The same thing is true in real estate. You can see REPA I to REPA III, but we also have a European real estate opportunistic strategy, same thing in Asia. So real opportunity. Just keep scaling those platforms regular way on the back of performance.  Second would be what we're doing in core. We have raised meaningful capital this year for core infrastructure and for core plus real estate. Again, very large end markets. Those are performing well and scaling.  Third is going global. A lot of what we've done started in the U.S. We're now expanding to Europe and Asia, so you're going to see us have a Europe and Asia core plus real estate strategy. That's something that we'll continue to add to our suite of products as we continue to take these efforts global and real assets.  Fourth would be selling to individuals. We talk about KREST a lot, but there's various other products that we're in the process of creating and other versions of real assets democratized for the individual investor.  And then to Craig's good point, it's not just equity. There's also a big opportunity to continue to scale what we're doing in real estate credit. Global Atlantic has allowed us to meaningfully expand that business, and we see more opportunities around the world, including in Europe, where we're going to start building a real estate credit platform there. So a long way of saying we agree with you. There's a lot of growth opportunity.
Operator: At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Rob, thank you for your help. And everybody, thank you for joining us. Please follow up with us directly with any follow-ups. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks again.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 10:00:00) =====
Craig Larson: Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I’m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP fingers in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Turning to our results. This quarter really was an exceptional quarter with record fundraising, deployment and monetization activity alongside continued strong investment performance. Fee-related earnings per share, as well as after tax distributable earnings per share were both record quarterly figures for us coming in at $0.53 and $1.05 respectively. Management fees increased over 40% year-over-year to $480 million, helping drive the 68% increase you see in fee-related earnings. And our monetization activities drove the after-tax DE figure, which is 2.5x the number we reported in the second quarter of last year. Our assets under management are now $429 billion, up over 90% from one year ago and up 17% just since last quarter. This reflects both record fundraising in the quarter as well as strong portfolio appreciation. And our book value per share, which is mark-to-market at every quarter is now $27.03. Net accrued carry on the balance sheet increased 13% since March 31, strong growth even after all of Q2’s realization activity and net cash and investments totaled $17 per share compared to $12 one year ago. So in terms of today’s call, I will kick things off with an overview of our fundraising activity, before turning things over to Rob, to walk through this quarter’s results. And Scott will provide a few closing remarks before we head into Q&A. So turning to fundraising. We had an exceptionally strong quarter with $59 billion of new capital raised on an organic basis. To help put this into perspective, this compares to $44 billion of new capital raised for all of 2020, which itself was a record year for KKR. Differentiated investment performance on behalf of our limited partners, continued scaling across our businesses and creativity and innovation all contributed to the fundraising results you’re seeing, which exceeded our expectations. A few highlights. First, we held initial closes across the next vintages of our North America Private Equity, Global Infrastructure and Core Private Equity strategies raising over $40 billion collectively in the quarter. Let me give a few more details here. With the $14.3 billion first close North America XIII is already larger than its predecessor and together with our Asia and Europe Private Equity funds, total committed capital across our three active PE funds on a global basis now exceeds $35 billion. In Infra, with just the first close already totaling $14.2 billion, Infrastructure IV is almost twice the size of its predecessor fund and together with the success we’ve had in Asia Infra and Core Infra over the last 12 months, total AUM across the infrastructure platform now stands at $38 billion and that’s $38 billion compares to $14.5 billion a year ago. And in terms of Core Private Equity, we held the first close on our most recent flagship at $12 billion, including $8 billion of third-party capital. AUM in Core Private Equity is now $28 billion and that $28 billion compares to $12 billion a year ago. The second fundraising highlight is the continued progress we’ve seen in perpetual capital with activity in this quarter across infrastructure, real estate as well as credit. This quarter, we raised an incremental $5 billion in our open-ended core infrastructure strategy, bringing AUM here to $7 billion. We launched KREST, a 40 Act vehicle with re-taxation that’s focused on individuals investors. In credit, our two publicly-traded BDCs, FSK and FSKR completed their merger to form one of the two largest BDC platforms with $16 billion of AUM. And in July, Global Atlantic announced two reinsurance block transactions. We expect these two transactions to add approximately $10.5 billion of perpetual AUM in the third quarter and the pipeline here continues to be strong. Perpetual capital is now 30% of AUM an inclusive of long dated strategic partnerships and that includes a new multi-asset class partnership we closed this quarter that figure is 43%. And remember, we have $21 billion of cash and investments on our balance sheet. The third fundraising highlight is our real estate platforms continued scaling. Focusing first on our opportunistic funds. We held a final close at REPE II our second European fund in the quarter. At $2.1 billion REPE II was 3 times the size of REPE I and with continued fundraising at our third America’s fund REPA III is now at $3 billion, more than 50% larger than REPA II and we have yet to hold a final close. With these closes, we are now a clear top five opportunistic real estate manager when you aggregate our three regional funds. Looking at the real estate platform more broadly. We now have 10 strategies focused across equity and credit on a global basis in a variety of different fund structures, targeting both institutional and retail clients. Real estate AUM in total is now $32 billion, and that $32 billion compares to $11 billion 12 months ago with tremendous room for continued growth. And finally, as you think about your models of future management fees, we now have $42 billion of committed capital with a weighted average management fee rate of just over 100 basis points that becomes payable when the capital is invested or enters its investment period. Last quarter, that amount was a little over $20 billion. So all in all, we had an excellent quarter and importantly, as we look forward over the next 12 months, we continue to have a robust fundraising pipeline across strategies as well as across geographies. So with that, let me turn it over to Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I’ll start off with our segment financial results for the quarter. Management fees came in at $480 million that’s up 9% from Q1 and up over 40% from this time last year. The investment periods for America’s VIII and in Infra IV both commenced in the quarter. So you saw partial quarters impact from these funds. Health Care Growth II and European real estate were also additive to management fees in the quarter. Our capital markets business had an excellent quarter with $219 million in fees. Transaction activity here was really diversified. We actually only had one fee event that was larger than $20 million and 50% of our revenues came from activity outside of the U.S. It was also a strong quarter for our third-party capital markets business with $61 million of revenues. We continue to get really good traction in this part of our business. Fee-related compensation came in at $170 million, a 22.5% compensation ratio. And our other operating expenses were $115 million modestly elevated with almost $20 million of placement fees recognized this quarter, given all of our fundraising activities. All of this brings us to record fee-related earnings of $470 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. That is up 68% year-over-year, and also represents a 62% margin. Turning to realizations, carried interest came in at just over $600 million, while realized investment income was approximately $370 million, bringing total realization activity to just under $1 billion for the quarter. Realization spent multiple funds, product and geographies. The diversification of our model really contributes to this broad base performance. In terms of our expenses, realized performance comp was $413 million and realized investment comp was $55 million. And on a year-to-date basis, our total compensation margin within our asset management segment, including equity-based comp is currently 36%. Moving onto our insurance segment, this quarter was the first full quarter of operating earnings from Global Atlantic, which totaled $128 million largely driven by strong core operating performance, as well as the sale of a strategic equity investment that helped bolster net investment income by $47 million. ROE for the quarter was 17% or 14% excluding this variable investment income. Putting it all together, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $926 million or $1.05 per share. On a year-to-date basis, our after-tax DE is $1.80 per share. These results are up 143% and 98% from the same time last year, really highlighting the momentum that we are seeing across the firm today. Our book value per share came in at $27.03 this quarter. The embedded gains in our balance sheet are currently $6.6 billion, as of June 30, which is up approximately $1 billion from Q1 and up over $5 billion from the same point last year, despite our high levels of realization activity over the corresponding periods. And our net cash and investments per share increased 12% from March 31 to $17 per share. Turning to our investment performance, which continues to be a real differentiator for us. We saw strong results again this quarter. Our PE portfolio appreciated 9% while our mature flagships appreciated 13%. Real estate continued to show strength increasing by 10% for the quarter. Our infrastructure business was relatively flat for the quarter, but continues to perform well overall up 21% over the last 12 months. And our credit funds are similarly performing well. Leveraged credit and alternative credit were up 2% and 6% in the quarter, respectively. Shifting to deployment, we had an extremely active quarter with total capital invested of approximately $19 billion. In private markets, deployment was diversified with $7 billion invested quite equally across private equity, infrastructure and real estate. With the remaining billion in growth and core strategies, and in public markets, we deployed over $10 billion across our private credit, dislocation and direct lending strategies. Despite this record level of deployment, dry powder now stands at $112 billion, which is up 63% from last quarter. And before I hand it off to Scott, I wanted to spend just a minute on our fundraising in Q2. While Craig mentioned that this is a record quarter for us, I think just as important is the quality of the capital that we raised. To give you a few stats, 98% of the capital we raised in Q2 has a contractual life of over eight years. Once turned on the fee paying capital is a blended fee rate of just under 100 basis points. And finally, 88% of the capital is either carry or an incentive fee eligible. So what we have accomplished over the last few months is going to have a very meaningful impact on our financial results for several years to come. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call. As Rob and Craig just explained, we had an exceptional quarter. Investment performance and capital raising are at record levels and broad based across strategies and geographies. Capital markets had second best quarter ever with significant activity across KKR and third-party business. On the insurance front, the Global Atlantic integration is proceeding well. And we continue to win new blocks alongside organic growth. And on top of all of this, we continue to launch new efforts and expand our product offerings, including in the retail market, providing even greater growth opportunities down the road. This quarter shows in outcomes of what we discussed at our April Investor Day. We are at an inflection point in a number of our businesses and see multiple ways for the firm to continue to grow AUM, revenues and profits. Let me highlight two examples from this quarter. First, we raised $8 billion of third-party capital for core PE, bringing AUM in that strategy to $28 billion. As a reminder, this business was created less than five years ago. And second, we’ve raised $7 billion for core infrastructure, a strategy that was launched less than a year ago. We are off to a great start here and on our way to being a market leader in this large and growing space. These are just two examples of how we are innovating and creating adjacent strategies to further scale our businesses in a highly efficient fashion. So there’s a lot of good to talk about this quarter. Within all the good, we are particularly proud of our investment performance. Our flagship private equity funds are up 86% over the last 12 months. Real assets are up 21%, and alternative credit is up 30%. The combination of this broad-based and strong investment performance, a growing client base across channels and multiple maturing businesses, plus the launching of new strategies and raising more permanent capital and Global Atlantic and capital markets scaling significantly is incredibly powerful. You saw this power in our Q2 results. The firm is executing at a high level and we have a lot of road ahead of us. With that, we’re happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Great. Good morning. Thanks everybody for taking the question. So maybe starting with a bit of an obvious of fundraising and a management fee question here, clearly very impressive start to the fundraising cycle, as you mentioned with $59 billion in the second quarter, and really, I guess more than halfway to your 2021-2022 investor day targets. So it’s helping with so much momentum in the business. Can you give us an update on how much larger you expect the flagship fundraisers to be relative to the first closed figures that you mentioned and how should we ultimately think about the $100 billion plus target from here and really maybe trying to breakdown the plus a little bit more. Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Good morning, Alex. It’s Rob. Thanks for the question. We can get into fundraising sides doing private placement rules, but let me just spend a minute on your question as it relates to how we’re thinking about fundraising. Maybe take a step back, and as a reminder, in February of this past year, we had introduced FRE per share guidance. We set at the time that we saw a clear path to comfortably exceeding $2 per share of FRE next year. Now at our Investor Day in April, you referenced $100 billion figure. We thought it would be helpful for our investors to understand some of the building blocks behind that FRE growth. So we noted that we expected to raise north of $100 billion of capital over the next couple of years. Part of the reason why we decided to give that statistic was that 2020 and itself was a record fundraising year at $44 billion. And so what we wanted to ensure people took away is that we didn’t think that that was a peak result for us. As it relates to this quarter, the fundraising that we announced exceeded our expectations and what we saw this quarter was more than just the pulling forward. I think a fundraising I expect in a future quarters, across several strategies, we really have exceeded the expectations that we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So I think it is fair to say that we feel a lot better, a better outlook for new capital raised over the next couple of years. And that will be certainly north of that $100 billion plus number that we put out there a couple of months ago. And I also think it’s fair to say that we feel even better, but achieving or exceeding the FRE targets that we put out at the beginning of this year, given all of the momentum that we have across our business today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I’m curious with all the growth across both core PE and core infra that you just noted. I wonder what you could tell us about the LP base and how much overlap there is with your opportunistic funds, meaning are the same clients that buy into the opportunistic funds buying into core PE or is this an expanding client base?
Craig Larson: Hey Glenn, it’s Craig, why don’t I start on that? And I think you’re right. It is interesting on the topic of core more broadly. When you look at core PE, core infra, core real estate, we now have around $37 billion of AUM across these strategies, and we’re seeing real interests, longer dated, lower risk reward profile compared to opportunistic and importantly, those that have a yield that’s attached. So we think the end markets are massive, really are for these core strategies, huge opportunity for us, really pleased with the first steps that you’ve seen. I think in terms of those first steps, we have seen the bigger investors wide say sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, insurance companies. They’ve been particularly active as the long dated nature of the investments in these strategies is in line with their long dated liabilities. And I think importantly, on the last part of your question, they view these strategies as a complement to the regular way opportunistic strategies and not in lieu of these strategies. And I think in the long-term or I should not even say, long-term look, you should expect us to explore the best ways for us to package and bring these types of products also to the retail market. As again, the end markets here are massive.
Scott Nuttall: I think, the only thing I’d add, it’s Scott, is if you look at by dollars into your question, there is not that much overlap between core and our opportunistic vehicles, there’s some, but we’re finding that these strategies are allowing us to expand our investor base.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
William Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, so I’ll try to squeeze a two-part question in, so I’m sorry to cheat the rules a little bit. First, just sort of tying back to the FRE discussion? You’ve also sort of laid out that you felt like you could get the $4 to $5 of DE somewhere between 2023 and 2024. Obviously, if you analyze this quarter, you’re already there. So just sort of question, how to think about that from here. And then secondly, a broader question for you, it seems like there is a very fast land grab going on in the retail channel. You seem to have terrific momentum. Is there any risk of or opportunity here where we’re scale will win out quicker, such that if I’m a retail distributor they may only be willing to work with five or 10 players, including KKR and so the branded players are wondering how the dialogues going on that score. Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Hey Bill, it’s Rob, I’ll take the first part of the question around those the guidance that we put out a couple of months ago. So we don’t have any updated guidance for this call, and obviously we’ll consider providing updated guidance in the future, but not as for today, I would say that I think it’s very fair to acknowledge that we are ahead of where we thought we would be. We are well ahead of expectation across most of our fundraising activity. The assets that we manage on behalf of both Atlantic are ahead of expectations. The momentum in our capital markets business is really good right now, maybe as good as it’s ever been. And we’ve got a lot of momentum across our performance which has generated a lot of embedded gains that sit across our carried interest in our balance sheet. And so we feel really good about the potential to drive meaningful additional revenue growth from here, as well as profitability growth. The one other thing, I would say out Bill, which is tangential, I suppose to your question that we often get is where we are from modernization perspective in Q3. We already have really good visibility here into meaningful revenue and monetization activity. As of right now, we have line of sight of approximately $650 plus million of performance in investment income. As a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or opened signed up. And we expect to close in the third quarter. In terms of the FRE is important from a compensation perspective, probably around 50% carry right now, and 50% weighted towards investment income. The last thing I’d say here is that I’d underscore that all of these are really approximations at this stage. But this is our best view right now from all the identified deal activity we expect to close in the upcoming quarter.
Scott Nuttall: And Bill, the second part of your question on the retail channel. But we’re really encouraged. We’ve been investing aggressively in that space and we’ve doubled the size of the team in the last 12 months. And we’re continuing to invest in that build-out. Part of the reason we’re encouraged is even as we’re doing that, build out in the U.S., we’re also investing to build out Europe and Asia, and we’re seeing significant engagement across private wealth and retail. We’re already – it’s kind of mid-teens percentage of our fundraising coming from that channel. So as an example, in the second quarter, about 14% of the money we raised was actually from retail and we don’t think we’re anywhere near our potential yet. So there’s a lot of opportunity ahead of us. In terms of the question about land grab, we were finding that we haven’t engaged a set of partners as we continue to build out a distribution in this space. We’re already on a number of platforms, adding products to those, and then developing new relationships all around the world. So we haven’t run into any resistance. If anything we’re finding is significant and growing interest in all things alternatives and a lot of interest in the registered funds in particular.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Lee: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I’m just curious, with fundraising going so well ahead of target and fund size is increasing substantially, maybe even more than you originally anticipated, how is this changing your commitments to the funds? I mean, are you reducing meaningfully how much you’re committing in order to maintain capacity for third-party investors? I mean, how has this kind of shaping how you think of your own capital commitments?
Scott Nuttall: We’re obviously very meaningful investors in our funds. We liked that we liked that positioning on our balance sheet, but when you look at our balance sheet capital relative to our fund capital. It’s a fairly small percentage. And so it really doesn’t need it to capacity and it hasn’t impacted in material way, how we thought about committing capital to our strategies from, it’s a good question, but that is – that’s, we do separate out those two things.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Davitt: Hey guys. Good morning. So you mentioned the capital markets didn’t really have any of that the chunky kind of numbers where you could see [indiscernible] a little over 200 million a quarter. So if we assume, deal activity remains this, I think you do have a couple of those chunky ones coming through in the second half that this kind of $200 million pluses is kind of a pretty good run rate, assuming activity levels stay this high.
Rob Lewin: Hey, Patrick, it’s Rob. So the way we think about our capital markets business really isn’t quarter-to-quarter. I think you’ve heard from us quite a bit, especially more recently that we see a lot of growth in that business, both secularly and then ability for us to be able to take market share on a global basis, we really think about that from an annual perspective and over a multi-year period of time, but I think as you look at the first half of 2021, roughly $330 million of fees, I think are LTM is about $680 million in our capital markets business. With a healthy amount of deal activity around the world, we think those are the types of numbers that hopefully should be achievable for us. And also the debt base, our expectation is over the next number of years is we should really be able to scale that business going forward.
Operator: Our next question come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You flagged the north – the three funds North America XIII, Global Infra IV, and, and healthcare 2% as having been turned on in the quarter. And I wonder if you could talk about how much of an impact that had on base management fees? And I guess I’m also the second part of it is a little – I’m surprised that you would have turned the funds on so early in that like Americas XII and infra three both still have around like $4 billion of uncalled commitments in them. So I wonder if you can flesh all those things out a bit.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Chris, it’s Rob. So a couple of things on – when you look at our investment vehicles, summary, I guess you’re looking at Pages 20 and Page 21 of our earnings release. The uncalled commitments there represent what’s called from the fund what they exclude is the amount of committed capital that we have two different strategies out there that has not been called yet as well as reserves in those funds. And so, as an example, our Americas XII fund on an adjusted basis they closer to $1.3 billion. And so I think that would be much more in line with how you would think about when to turn on that fund. And as it relates to your the first part of your question on management fees. You’re right. Those funds turned on. I think about two-thirds of the way the big ones through the quarter. And so we’d expect a little bit of an additional ramp up in Q3 as those funds get going. And we turn to post-investment period on the predecessor funds as they run off, I think management fee number there, that could be in the range of $40 plus million for the third-quarter more of on a run rate basis, I think is something that would be an approximation that I think would be a reasonable one at this stage.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Giblat with Exane BNP. Please proceed with your question.
Arnaud Giblat: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how you view used opportunities to deploy capital and specifically what target returns are being discussed with investors. Have these been or are these the same targeted returns that you used to have or have they been scaled back given current market levels?
Craig Larson: Sure. Arnaud, it’s Craig, why don’t I start, I’ll let Scott on give an update in terms of overall target returns. And I’m glad you asked about deployment because honestly, given all we’ve had to go through today, we probably haven’t talked about deployment as much detail as we should. I think the main takeaway is we’re continuing to deploy actively. So in terms of private markets first we’ve continued to invest meaningfully first half deployment was a little over $12 billion LTM deployments, a little over $24 million. So again, that pace has been very healthy and what you’re really seeing there is diversification. So Rob mentioned this in our prepared remarks, deployment in Q2 was between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion individually across all the private equity infrastructure and real estate. So we’ve had a really nice balance with the growth strategies and core making up that incremental piece. I think in terms of themes, you’re seeing investments in really good companies with strong growth prospects. And I think overall at the moment, there’s probably more dislocation in Asia, this leading to better opportunities for us in that region. And in public markets, what you’re really seeing is, is the growth in the overall footprint of the firm. So AUM and our credit business has increased from a little over $70 billion a year ago to $170 billion as of June 30. So you’re seeing a meaningful increase in deployment in public markets, just recognizing just – again, the dramatic increase in the footprint of the firms. So in terms of the $10 billion this quarter, again, that was pretty actively – that was actively deployed across a number of strategies, direct lending, opportunistic credit, asset based finance, et cetera.
Rob Lewin: Yes. And Arnaud your question around targeted returns. The short answer is, there hasn’t really been any change in how we think about it. And we talked about this a bit on prior calls. But one of the things we’ve been very focused on the last several years is having the firm get behind some themes that we think will benefit over the next several years. And frankly, some of those themes have been accelerated by virtue of what we’ve all just are going through with COVID. So in private equity, if you look at where our deployment has been, as an example, a lot of deployment in digital and technology, areas like health and wellness, cyber security, nesting and series of themes like those. Infrastructure, again, fiber and telecom would be a couple of themes we’ve been investing behind and renewables and real estate, industrial properties, multifamily and credit asset based finance as the banks have pulled back and housing. And then, Global Atlantic is obviously a very big investment behind the thematic of savings tax deferral, the aging population and people looking to manage their own retirement wealth. And so what we’re finding is if you get behind these big themes, there’s a big opportunity to generate outsized returns. And there’s a lot of dispersion in the market. There’s going to be some of these areas and themes that we think will be big winners. We’re getting behind those. And I think part of the reason you’ve seen our returns be so strong is we’ve in effect been overweight a lot of those sectors that are benefiting those themes that are working and underweight others. So we think by continuing to pursue that effort we’ve got an opportunity to continue to generate outsize returns and our targets haven’t really changed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to circle back to core PE and core infrastructure. I appreciate those are longer dated strategies with lower return targets. I would just hope that you can elaborate a bit on the platform that you’ve built out there, the investment strategy more broadly. What sort of deals can make sense and maybe can remind us how the economics work for KKR. And what’s your sense on the timeframe for putting all that capital to work?
Craig Larson: So Mike, it’s Craig, why don’t I start there? In infrastructure is an interesting place to begin. So at our Investor Day, we walked through infrastructure really as a case study in terms of how we look to build an investment platform. And so that begins with strong performance of flagship strategies. And then you can – there’s a focus on scaling those flagships and innovating and that innovation can happen geographically. So you’ve seen that with Asia Infra, and can also come through adjacent strategies and you’ve seen that through core PE. So that’s really where we are today. We have a built out infra franchise with three distinct market segments, our Global Infra Fund Series Asia, and for fund series and diversified core. And in terms of core and the focus on those investments, core infra is really targeting more mature cash generative assets with a focus on long-term predictable cash flows. So we’re looking for simplicity and low execution risk all in that open-ended perpetual vehicle. And so our focus here is we want to buy simplicity and hold simplicity. That’s really the focus. In terms of core private equity, that’s really of innovation where we can’t find a home for great investment opportunities. And so this again is a long duration strategy where we expect to hold investments and compound value for 10 to 15 years. But as you noted again, the risk reward is different than our opportunistic PE funds. We’re looking for a mid-teen IRR businesses with less disruption risk, very good cash flows, often consolidation opportunities and fragmented sectors. Again, we’ve been at this business longer at this point. We have what you think is a really incredible portfolio of companies. The gross IRR here today since inception is 27%. And I think there’s a final point as it relates to core and the business model because given the participation on our balance sheet, core PE has really contributed to the compounding of our book value. So when you look at the core line on Page 14 of our press release, you see $4.2 billion of fair value that was part of the $17.5 billion of investments. That $4.2 billion has just under $2 billion of cost associated with it. So we have over $2 billion of embedded gains on our balance sheet. So with shareholders were participating in the economics from the third-party capital management fees and carry with performance over time. But in addition, that compounding aspect is an additional powerful way that we also can participate in the success here.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Michael, it’s Scott. Just a couple of things I’d add. One, the point I understand, this is deal flow we were already seeing. So to Craig’s point, think lower risk, longer duration opportunities that we really like the risk reward, but it did not fit into opportunistic vehicles. But were investments, we liked, nonetheless, we now have homes for those investments. We did not before. And because of the fact that this was deal flow, we were already seeing it was being sourced by our existing teams. We have not had to build new teams to actually prosecute these strategies. So the existing teams are actually just forcing these investments, if they don’t fit in the opportunistic fund then they can be considered for core. And so it’s been a highly profitable, incremental source of AUM and fees for us. And it’s something that we’re really monetizing deal flow that was already here. And in terms of the deployment period, we have been very actively deploying that. I think our expectation is for core PE that’ll probably get deployed over a three to five-year period and for core infrastructure with this first pool of capital we’re operating at a current run rate that would be faster than that. And we’ll continue to add capital to that strategy as well over time. Rob, why don’t you pick up on economics?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Mike, so the management fees on both these products get paid when the capital is invested. And so this capital is largely in AUM right now and over time gravitate towards fee paying AUM and the capital costs both these strategies are carrying except if fee eligible. And so we think we’ll be a contributor to performance revenue over the long-term.
Craig Larson: And Mike, it’s Craig, one final point is kind of an interesting statistic and this actually ties into Glenn’s question earlier, but it’s interesting when you look at core infra of the $7 billion of capital, that’s been raised over 40% of the commitments have come from LPs that are new to KKR. So in terms of how these strategies are helping us really broaden the LP base again, it’s an interesting statistic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Lee: Thanks for taking my follow-up. I guess, just on the Global Atlantic, is it possible to just get a number one, a sense of what their kind of regular flow is? Like, if we think about it outside of reinsurance transactions, what you’re seeing is kind of quarter-to-quarter regular flow, if they don’t do the transaction. And then maybe just update us on the amount of capital that they’ve got available once they get through the $10 billion of deals closing this quarter.
Scott Nuttall: Great Rob, I’ll take that, it’s Scott. Look, in terms of the way to think about it, organic away from a block activity, a couple of things I’d point. One, remember they have a significant distribution presence and are raising money in the individual sector. And so if you want to think about that $8 billion to $10 billion of annual flow give or take that’s kind of a good starting number to work with. But on the institutional side, I know the block activity is the stuff that gets the press release and gets more and more focus and attention. There’s also a number of other things that we do there. We have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of different counterparties. There’s pension risk transfer activity, which is incredibly active and it’s getting more active, especially this year. We’re also active in the funding agreement markets. So there’s a lot of ways to grow on the institutional side as well that is a significant. And those are also billion dollar plus opportunities individually. And so, we see that as another way to grow. So in terms of the answer to the question, you could think $8 billion to $10 billion plus several billion on top of that from more of the kind of flow related institutional business away from blocks. And in terms of the capital available question, as a reminder, when we actually closed the transaction earlier this year, we raised an incremental $250 million with primary capital and there is runoff in this business as well. So we’re generating new capital by virtue of our earnings. We’re freeing up capital with some of the runoff, and we’re replacing that with all the affirmation plus all the block activity. And if the company needs more capital we’re highly confident we’ll be able to access it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Hey guys, thanks for taking the follow-up question here. I had another sort of question around retail and specifically related to KREST. It looks like AUM there is approaching about $700 million, not huge in a context obviously of KKR as a whole, but it’s an important driver potentially, as you think about the affluent and the mass affluent part of the retail market. So, can you maybe walk us through your sort of distributions for KREST specifically how many platforms and sort of the type of platforms that are contributing to flows here, just thinking through kind of warehouse independent broker dealers, et cetera. And really trying to understand any distinct advantages of having something like this in a 40 Act wrapper that sort of really resonates with distribution partners. And I guess lastly here I think Greg, you mentioned that there might be other opportunities to bring additional retail product to market, maybe in core securities, we get some early kind of thoughts on that. Thanks.
Craig Larson: Alex, why don’t I begin? So just for those of you less familiar, KREST is an acronym for KKR Real Estate Select Trusts. It’s a continuously offered registered closed-end fund with re-taxation that was created for individual investors. And it does – it features daily pricing and subscriptions via a ticker. So we’re at the very beginning of KREST evolution, which is exciting for us. We began raising capital on two platforms only in June and over time we do expect to see an expansion across many platforms globally. So Alex, we don’t have a whole ton of details. I think the main takeaways for you are really threefold. One, the size of the end markets here are a massive; two it’s a big opportunity for us; and three, we’re really pleased with our first steps. And we’ll keep you abreast as we move forward from here both as it relates to this, in addition to as other products and strategies are launched again, through those products tailored towards the – towards the retail market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
William Katz: Okay. Thanks also for taking the extra questions. So a two-parter again, maybe one for Rob. As you think about the FRE margin 62% this quarter, and was way down a little bit by placement fees, obviously turning on some of the bigger funds. Where do we go from here? And then maybe stepping back, given what seems to be a step function of earnings power, any thoughts on dividend policy? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so we’ve signaled in the past that we expect to continue to make some near-term investments here across distribution and technology. But even with those investments, we do see a medium opportunity drive scale efficiencies in our operating expenses. And we think that’s going to yield margin expansion over time. We’ve been operating generally in the low 60s. We do see a pathway over time to take that up to the mid 60s. But we’re going to work through some of that additional investment over the near-term that we’ve flagged that we think is going to pay dividends for us in the long-term. And then your question as it relates to dividend policy, nothing’s changed as it relates to how we think about returning capital to shareholders. Our policy and how we think about that has been consistent for a number of years now. We would expect it to continue to be consistent just to say, we’ll evaluate it annually. We’ll do that at the beginning of the year, like we have done in past years. And our expectation as we have done in past years is that we’re going to look to modestly increase our dividend on an annual basis. So that should be the expectation going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow-up here. More of a follow-up question, I guess, for Rob, if you could just maybe help us out with the deployment and realizations off the balance sheet in the quarter please? Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Sure. The deployment was $800 million off the balance sheet in the quarter, and the realizations were just about $900 million. On a LTM basis, those numbers Mike are 3.1 of deployment and 2.6 of realization.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to hand it back to Mr. Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Thank you, everybody for your time this morning. We look forward to chatting with you again after next quarter’s results. Anything in the interim, please, of course, feel free to reach out directly. Thank you once again.

Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I’ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I’m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our press release and our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Earlier this morning, we posted our earnings release presentation. You’ll likely have noticed a few changes. First, recognizing this is the first quarter post the closing of The Global Atlantic acquisition, we’re now reporting our results with two segments, our Asset Management segment, in addition to a new Insurance segment, which reflects our approximate 60% interest in GA’s financial results. In addition, given the changes we made to our compensation framework that we introduced last quarter, a number of the line items on our segment income statement have changed. We ran through this on our Q4 call, as well as at Investor Day. Now to help with comparability, we posted a presentation on our website in early April with three years of recast financial information on a quarterly basis. That presentation, of course, is still available on the Investor Center section of our website and it could be helpful for you to refer to that as you consider our results compared to prior periods. And finally, we’ve changed the framework of the earnings release itself to make results easier to digest, while improving our disclosure and transparency at the same time. We trust that you will find the new framework, as well as the additional disclosure to be helpful. Now I expect many of you joined us at our Investor Day only three weeks ago. For those of you that didn’t have the opportunity, we would encourage you to watch a replay of the event and review the accompanying presentation both of which can be found on our website. We really feel that the event helps everyone gain a better understanding of where we are now with the firm. And importantly, all of the opportunities we have to continue to grow and scale from here. And right on the heels of this event, we’re pleased to be reporting an excellent quarter. After-tax distributable earnings came in at $0.75 per share. Fee related earnings are $0.41 per share. Management fees increased 31% year-over-year, driving the 36% increase in our FRE per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our assets under management are now $367 billion. This reflects the closing of Global Atlantic, strong investment performance, in addition to continued fundraising momentum. And our book value per share, which is mark-to-market every quarter is now $25.84. This is up over 50% from the $16.52 we reported one year ago and is 12% ahead of the figure we reported just last quarter. The continued growth in our book value was really a testament to the strong investment performance we’re seeing across the firm. And finally, as we announced last quarter, we increased our dividends beginning with this quarter. So our annualized dividend per share is now $0.58. In terms of today’s call, I will kick things off with an overview of investment performance and fundraising before turning it over to Rob to walk through this quarter’s financials, and at the end, Scott will provide a few closing remarks and we’ll head into Q&A. So to begin, we’ve continued to have very strong investment performance. Beginning first with private equity, the portfolios a whole appreciated 19% in the quarter and is up 56% over the last 12 months. And performance in our flagship fund has been even stronger, up 28% for the quarter and up almost 80% over the last 12 months. At our Investor Day, one of the themes we discussed was the importance of winning in tech and the significance of the investments we’ve made in tech. Remember that 38% of our private equity deployment over 2018 to 2020 was in companies with tech and digital theme. And you’re seeing the impact of these investments within our performance figure. AppLovin, our mobile technology investment in North America’s wealth fund went public earlier this quarter and is currently trading at about 15 times our costs. And Darktrace and KnowBe4, two cybersecurity businesses also both went public over the last couple of weeks and are trading well north of costs. These were three of our six portfolio companies that went public in April. And alongside of this IPO activity, we see strong performance at private tech oriented investments like Internet Brands, OneStream Software, Byte Dance, RB Media, Kokusai Electric and Calabrio, a software business that we exited earlier in Q2. We’ve seen continued performance across our real asset strategies. Over the past 12 months our opportunistic real estate funds withstood all the market volatility, appreciating 13%, while in infrastructure, the portfolio appreciated 18%. Turning to credit, our alternative credit composite appreciated 7% in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months. We’ve seen differentiated investment performance within our dislocation strategy and performance in the quarter and LTV periods were strong within Lending Partners III and Special Sits II. And our leverage credit composite appreciated 2% in the quarter at 25% over the last 12 months. And looking at our performance here over a broader timeframe, both our standalone high yield and bank loan track records continue to rank as top quartile over one year-year, three-year, five-year and seven-year timeframes. And reflecting the strong investment performance across strategies, our balance sheet investment portfolio appreciated 12% in the quarter and is up 52% on a trailing 12-month basis. Now on the heels of strong investment performance, we’re seeing continued momentum in fundraising with $15 billion of new capital raised in Q1 and $51 billion over the trailing 12 months. Notably, in the first quarter, we held the final close on our Asia IV Fund raise at $15 billion. Building on our differentiated investment track record, Asia IV is the largest private equity fund dedicated to investing in the Asia-Pacific region. And Asia IV really continues the momentum across our Asia-Pacific platform, given the final closings held just last quarter for our inaugural Asia infrastructure and real estate funds. Fundraising activity in the quarter also included new capital raised in our healthcare strategic growth strategy, core infrastructure and our opportunistic America’s real estate strategy. We also raised our first SPAC and we’re active in the CLO markets raising new CLOs in the quarter both in the U.S., as well as Europe. And our fundraising was not only strong for the core itself, but also diversified across many strategy. We’ve a lot of conviction in our fundraising momentum going forward as we remain focused on our over 20 strategies that we expected come to market. And with that, let me turn it over Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. I’m going to begin this morning by reviewing our segments financial results for the quarter. Our fee revenues totaled $586 million in Q1. Of particular note here, our management fees continued their robust growth and came in at $440 million, which is 31% ahead of last year. And adding to our strong management fee quarter, our Capital Markets business generated $112 million of transaction fees, which saw nice contributions across the Board. We remain very encouraged by the forward pipeline in our Capital Markets business, as well as opportunities here for continued risk. Fee related compensation came in at $132 million or 22.5% of fee related revenues. Right in the midpoint of that 20% to 25% annual range we introduced last quarter. And our other operating expenses totaled $19 million. Putting those pieces together, our fee related earnings were $364 million or $0.41 per share and our FRE margin was 62% for the quarter. We continue to be very confident that our FRE will comfortably exceed $2 per share next year. Our fundraising momentum is as good as it has ever been. The asset base of Global Atlantic continues to grow and we have very good line of sight to larger pools of capital and during their investment periods. Moving to our realized performance income, we generated $170 million of revenue for the quarter and our realized investment income was $460 million, which is a high point for us as a firm. But some of these revenue line items is approximately $630 million for the quarter. Our only cost associated with our realized performance and realized investment income is compensation, which came in right at of the respective annual ranges we indicated earlier this year. So in total, our Asset Management operating earnings came in at $817 million for the quarter. On top of that, our share of Global Atlantic’s earnings added an incremental $63 million for the months of February and March, bringing total distributable operating earnings to $880 million, which is up 68% year-on-year. And finally, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $660 million or $0.75 per share. One additional note here, our tax rate in the quarter was a bit elevated. The driver of this was a large accident that was structured in a way that resulted in the recognition of 100% of our tax expense, while only realizing approximately 50% of the investment income. Absent this, our after-tax DE would have been $0.81 for the quarter versus the $0.75 we reported this morning. Looking forward, we do expect will benefit from the reverse of this, as that investment is monetized and those gains become realized without the burden of the tax expense. Turning to deployment, coming off a record year in 2020, our total capital investment came in at $7 billion for the quarter and $31 billion over the last 12 months, which is up over 30% from the prior period. Importantly, when you dig a little deeper, our private markets deployment, which is generally longer dated and has higher profit potential, was up 77% versus the prior LTM period. That’s bigger is really the best representation for how we lean in as an organization over the last 12 months. With much of that capital having been deployed or committed during the market downturn earlier in 2020. We do think our activity levels here are relatively distinguished across our many peers, where deployment across private market strategies tended to be flat to down year-over-year. At the same time, we’ve never deployed more capital in our 45-year history. We are very confident that this elevated level of deployment will serve us well for years to come as those investments mature. And finally, turning to our balance sheet. Our book value per share is currently $25.84, which is up 12% from last quarter and up more than 50% versus March of 2020. Even if you compare this performance to pre-pandemic levels, our book value per share is up almost 35% in a little bit over a year and it’s another tangible example of our business models ability to compound capital. Moving away from the specifics of the quarter, as I look at our overall performance, I think, there are really four things worth noting. First, we had a really strong quarter. We reported $0.41 of FRE per share and $0.75 after-tax DE per share, and as you know from our guidance, we expect an acceleration in both of these figures. The second relates to the strong investment performance we’ve continued to deliver on behalf of our limited partners. Craig ran you through the performance statistics for the quarter, as well as the last 12 months really do stand out. But I think even more telling and differentiating our platform versus others is our investment performance over a multiyear period of time. As just one example, our current flagship Americas, Europe and Asia PE fund had gross returns of 49%, 26% and 44% from inception. This is directly led to the high levels of fundraising momentum that we are currently benefiting from. And this framework is not limited to private equity. At our Investor Day, we detailed the strength of our investment performance across our four growth and real asset and credit platforms. As a firm, we have a 45-year history of investment excellence and we’re continuing to build on this long track record of success. Third point is the significant amount of related earnings inside of the firm that we expect to flow through our operating earnings over the next number of years. At our Investor Day, one of the statistics we discussed was the $9.1 billion of total unrealized gains in our balance sheet at the end of 2020. Those are embedded gains from our investments, as well as gross unrealized carry. That $9.1 billion increase to $12.3 billion as of the end of March. That number can obviously move around a bit and will apart be driven by the overall tone in the markets. However, the $3 plus billion move in only three months and in a quarter with a heavy level of realized activity. I think really illustrates the strength of the underlying investments and also what it means for our ability to generate realized profitability over the next number of years. And finally, we’re off to a really great start with GA and we really just began to see the impact of how Global Atlantic can flow through our financial results. There’s a lot more for us to do here and we’ll keep you abreast of our progress in the quarters ahead. All of this really does support why we expect significant acceleration of after-tax DE to the $4 to $5 range by the 2023, 2024 timeframe. Remember, this earnings power is largely already in our firm. We have a lot of conviction that we’ll be able to execute on our strategy and continue to deliver really meaningful results for our LPs, shareholders, employees and all the communities that we operate in. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott for some closing thoughts.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Given the reason Investor Day, I’m going to be very brief. As a firm, we have never had a stronger team, better connectivity, stronger investment results, higher unrealized gains and carry, more businesses scaling and reaching their inflection points, and more fund in and coming in. As a result, we have never had more ways to grow, more visibility on that growth and we’re confident in our future. And all of that is before Global Atlantic, which gives us even more perpetual capital, even more visibility, even more ways to grow and a fantastic management that will make us even stronger and faster. We are hopeful all that came through during the Investor Day and we are looking forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we’re happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi. I appreciate the call -- question. I guess I was just like a -- maybe a little follow up on a few things that we didn’t fully cover during Investor Day or today and just like maybe if you’re still in pursuing long dated partnerships as you refer 10% that you earn. And maybe just comment on thoughts around where you're at in building these various platforms. Thanks a lot.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. First, with respect to long dated partnerships, we are still pursuing those. So these for everybody’s benefit are the oftentimes multi-decade recycling strategic partnerships that will create with institutional investors largely, largely they’re invested across asset classes and have some component of recycling to them. And so we continue to pursue those. They take a long time to structure. But we continue to have an active pipeline. So don’t take any message from the Investor Day lack of commentary just continues to be something that we’re focused on going. We’ll have update for you over time, because there’s a couple that are getting close. On the secondary side, as we’ve mentioned in the past, we continue to look at the space. We’re analyzing whether we want to build or whether there’s something that might make sense to buy, really hard to have to buy work from a cultural fit standpoint at times, but we are looking and we’ll have more to share with you over time. But nothing more to share today except that we continue to pursue it.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, clearly, looks like momentum in the business is very strong, lots of LP demand and you are guys’ performance continues to be really good. Has this backdrop change the capacity for some of the flagship funds that you’re currently in the market with? And if the demand sort of exceeds the capacity appetite you have in those flagship vehicles? Any other ways you’re thinking you could sort of monetize on that demand? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Alex. As you know, it’s really been a great fundraising environment, by the best we’ve seen in a long time. We’re seeing increased engagement from investors across the Board across different asset classes and we do find ourselves in some situations in the happy circumstance where a fund might be a capacity constraint and we’re able to talk to them about different things that we’re doing. So, for example, as you know, we raise our private equity flagship funds in a bit of a different way than others. We have three regional funds, as opposed to one global fund and we just closed Asia, we’re in the market right now with Americas, Europe will come relatively quickly on the back of the Americas fundraise. There’s core, there’s growth, there’s a lot of different ways we can talk to investors across just privately before you get to real assets and credit. And so that incremental potential demand that we oftentimes will see especially lately, we’re able to pivot some of that unmet demand into some of these other asset classes and strategies that are adjacent and that’s the focus right now.
Alex Blostein: Thank you.
Operator: Next question will be coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question is on Global Atlantic, I noticed on slide were actually page 17 of the press release had $12 billion of Global Atlantic AUM sits in private markets, while the rest is in public markets. What strategies or assets does the $12 billion private markets invest in and are these KKR strategies today or is there an opportunity to rotate this AUM into KKR strategies in the future?
Rob Lewin: Hey, Craig. It’s Rob. Really good question and so a couple things. As we thought about our IMA and how to approach in that across our strategy, we really looked at where the underlying investments were at Global Atlantic, most of those are credit oriented and will fit in our public markets business, but there are a number that are in the real estate space, principally real estate credit and so we’ve put those across our real estate business. As it relates to rotating the Global Atlantic balance sheet and to take their products, we are in the very early innings of that. We think there’s a lot of opportunity for the Global Atlantic balance sheet, as well as our Asset Management businesses being able to get that rotation done. We’re just a couple months in here and that’s going to take some time to make sure that we get ramped up. We’ll provide additional updates over time. But we’re not really seeing the benefit of that the Global Atlantic had nor the KKR.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Devin Ryan: Great. Good morning, everyone. Question just on the outlook for monetizing some of the embedded gains on the balance sheet just given recent performance. And I guess I want to maybe tie it into proposals around capital gains rates potentially changing and if that might accelerate definitely the thought around some of the balance sheet gains? And just bigger picture kind of any views around potential tax changes on the portfolio? I appreciate it we don’t have too much detail yet. But any color would be helpful? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Devin. I’ll answer the second part of your question first. Potential pending tax legislation will have no impact on how we monetize our portfolio. It is really about making sure that we’re a fiduciary for our clients and exiting it at the appropriate time. In terms of our outlook for monetizing the portfolio, as you noted, there’s a very significant amount of embedded gains. Our expectation is here -- here is that we’ve got a number of assets particularly on the core side that for a number of years can compound in capital, but we also have a fairly mature portfolio that we think can get realized over the coming quarters here. I know one of the questions that we get a lot in this forum and so I will answer as part of this overall questions is what our forward visibility looks like in terms of monetizing our revenue from an investment perspective and a performance perspective. As relates to Q2 specifically, we already have visibility and a very substantial amount of revenue we have. As of now, that line of sight is $700 plus million of performance and investment income. So as a reminder, this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close in Q2. In terms of split, as I know that for now especially our articulating compensation. I’d say, it’s probably 60 to two-thirds carried interest and the remainder in investment income.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Carrier: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned being very active in deploying capital over the last year, which is position you will and we’re seeing it in the performance. But just maybe, how are you thinking about deployment at this point, given one hand, you got rising valuations, you get the outlook for economic growth is fairly robust. So just an update there?
Craig Larson: Hey, Mike. It’s Craig. Why don’t I start there? I think you’re right, the first part of the answer does relate to the overall market where you’re seeing tremendous activity and you really do see this in broad M&A stats. So Global announced M&A volumes in Q1, we’re two excellent they were last year and it’s actually been the most active start to the year in terms of broad M&A. Now, in terms of us in a market like this, where you have a lot of activity and a lot of interested sellers, given valuations and that activity, discipline is critical. And alongside of that, we think that a strong thematic approach is also critical and so it is important to really pick your spots, where to lean in and you want to really need to have deep expertise, in addition to real conviction. And so you’re right, you’ve heard us talk about our focus for some time now, for instance, on some of the tech and digital themes, Joe ran through that at Investor Day, almost 40% of our deployment in private markets, again, were investments with tech and digital themes over the last three years. And I think, we’re still very busy and opportunities that fit this framework. Now, I think, the ones that we’re attracted to are going to be companies that need capital for primary growth and we do view that a little differently versus someone who’s simply looking to monetize an asset or an asset, if you will. But again, discipline is an important part of the equation. There’s no question about it.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Pleased proceed with your question.
Chris Harris: Great. Thanks. There’s a little bit of moving parts with a P&L, you got G&A coming in for a partial quarter, beginning of the second quarter, guys, how should we be thinking about the weighted average blended fee rate for KKR as an organization?
Rob Lewin: Yeah. That’s a good question. Obviously, you’re right, you’ve got two months of GA, as opposed to full three months. I think on that basis you’d certainly be able to look at it in a cleaner way on the quarter. Of course, given where our IMA is sat and we talked at the last call that that’s maximum of 30 basis points, that’s going to have downward pressure on overall fee margin. But I think Q1 could be a good indication, probably, with a little bit more downward pressure, because you have the extra month offset by the fact that, we’ve got a really good and healthy outlook in fundraising across a number of our private strategies that have higher fee rates associated with them. So a bit of a challenging question to fully answer, Chris, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor around where blended fee rates can go across the enterprise.
Chris Harris: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Gerry O’Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Gerry O’Hara: Great. Thanks. I was hoping we might be able to get a little bit more color as it relates to the performance fee revenue line item that I think is new this quarter. But is there any sort of seasonality to that line item, anniversaries, perhaps, of product and what products in particular, we might be tracking or looking at to get a sense of how that line item might grow? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Gerry. It is new this quarter and really reflects how we’ve tried to revamp our P&L to make it on a lot of ways. We think easier to understand and also more comparable with a number of our peers. And so what you’d expect to see in that line item. Really our incentive fees more from our perpetual capital vehicles, where the incentive fees that we generate are based on the underlying yield of the portfolio as opposed to mark-to-market. So things that are more stable in nature, the types of products that you’re going to see in there are going to be Type 1 incentive fees across our BDC platform, some of the core vehicles that we’re raising across infrastructure and credit, we’ve got a couple of SMEs that got have comparable type of fee arrangement. So those are the types of fees you’re going to see. We see a big opportunity over the next number of years to really scale that line item up for the firm and we thought it made sense to break it out as distinct from incentive fees based off of mark-to-market performance, like, a number of our peers have done in the past.
Gerry O’Hara: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today will be coming from the line of Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprus: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is a little bit more of a follow up from Investor Day, just on the origination platforms. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate around some of the origination platforms that you’ve been building out in partnership with a number of different specialty finance companies. I believe these are mostly partnerships. So I just -- how do you think about the trade-offs of partnering versus owning when it comes to these origination platforms? And what situation do you think it might make sense to own and maybe you could just talk about some of the capabilities that you think could make sense to add over the next couple years?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks. Very good question, Michael. It’s Scott. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we have created or been partnered with others on about 16 or so origination platforms. And they’re getting to be quite substantial, 4,000 employees, $100 plus billion of AUM or balance sheet across the entire group. Just by way of background, these were largely created out of our private credit business, in particular, private credit opportunities vehicles, where we saw an opportunity in asset based finance on the back of banks pulling back from a number of different asset classes, where we thought the risk reward was really pretty interesting. That effort was started clearly before the Global Atlantic transaction. And so what we’re doing right now is we’re in the process of thinking about how do we want to pivot this strategy and how do we want to evolve what we’re doing there in light of the significant demand that Global Atlantic has for those underlying asset classes and that origination. And so, think of it this way, we started really just funding entirely out of the funds and then we started to move a little bit more of a hybrid approach. So we created an aircraft leasing business as an example called Altavair, that was created as almost like a joint venture between our infrastructure business, our private credit business and our balance sheet. And so we’ve been moving in the direction of actually trying to think about the answer to your question this own versus partner. And I think what you’ll find and we’ll share this, our thinking with you going forward, is that we are going to have some of these that will be more transitory and we own for a while and then move on and sell as fiduciaries for our funds. And we may have some that over time move into more the Altavair type approach which is a bit of a hybrid. But with the addition of Global Atlantic, it really broaden us how we can think about investing in this space and some of this stuff, it might make sense to make more permanent either on the KKR balance sheet or the Global Atlantic balance sheet, or both.
Michael Cyprus: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Pleased proceed with your questions.
Robert Lee: Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. While this has come on Investor Day, but I think, it would be just a helpful refresher on Global Atlantic really maybe a two parter, if you just refresh us on the amount of capital available for their growth right now. I mean, I know you injective when you bought it. I think something $250 million. There’s a sidecar vehicle, I believe, too, but updating -- maybe an update on their growth capacity as it stands today would be helpful? And then also maybe GA kind of standalone, what was its organic growth in the quarter kind of separate from this, how it appears being added to your income statement balance sheet?
Rob Lewin: Hi, Rob. I will take the first shot at that. So that’s good question, and obviously, one of the big opportunities for us is to really be able to work with the GA management to go get the scale, which they believe is out there in the industry, and Alan, at our Investor Day, as you noted, did a really good job articulating the different $1 billion plus growth opportunities that are available. And so we’ve got a couple of different ways to be able to go after that and do feel like we’re well set up. One, we raised $250 million of primary capital at the time of closing a couple months ago the first primary capital raise that the company has done. So that’s very meaningful in terms of our ability to scale up the platform. Number two, you noted the sidecar, and we think there’s a real opportunity from the sidecar finance perspective going forward that can start to be able to go after these growth opportunities. And the last and I’d say, Rob, is one of the big strategic attractions of this transaction, I think, both for the GA management team and also as we evaluated this deal was our ability to help them access capital, when really meaningful growth opportunities are became available. And so, we’re very focused on that and I do think that there’s a real opportunity here for us to be able to go obtain additional capital, if it’s required for things that make a ton of sense from a growth perspective for GA.
Robert Lee: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Harris: Thanks. Hey, Rob. I know this is really tough to estimate, but how should we be thinking about like a, quote-unquote, normalized tax rate for KKR now going forward. I know there was some noise in the first quarter? And then, related to that, I just want to confirm that the Insurance earnings are coming in to P&L post-tax?
Rob Lewin: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good question. So, yes, the -- our Insurance segment, we thought the right way to illustrate that was on a post-tax basis and so that’s a fully tax number that you’re seeing for our Insurance segment. As it relates to our blended tax rate, and I would say, our guidance here really hasn’t changed since we became C-Corp and we benefit from a step up in basis that we had at the time of the C-Corp conversion. And that’s why you see our tax rate out for the time being that has trended below the statutory rate, obviously, this quarter, in particular, you had some noise, upward pressure that I mentioned. But I think, a mid-to-high-teens type tax rate that’s going up over time and landing in the low 20s at the statutory rate over time, as our step up comes down over time is the right way to think about taxes at KKR. So, not too dissimilar from what you’ve heard from us over the years, other than the fact that the step up will continue to come down over time and our tax rate will slowly migrate up.
Chris Harris: Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I’ll turn the floor back to management for any additional comments.
Craig Larson: Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much and thank you, everybody, for your continued interest in KKR. We know that with the Investor Day and our earnings amount of time that you’ve spent focused on us has been considerable this quarter. We’re, of course, available for any additional follow-up questions. And otherwise, we’ll look forward to reviewing our Q2 results in three months. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you everyone. This will conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR’s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I’m joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We’d like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we’ve also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we’ll be referring to over the course of the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Our call this morning is organized into three parts. The first relates to where we’ve been with a focus on our fourth quarter results. We had a strong finish to a solid year and I’m going to walk you through these. The second part of the call relates to where we’re going. Rob is going to lead you through this part of a call. This includes an update on the Global Atlantic acquisition, which closed on February 1st. And additionally, Rob is going to review some important changes in our reporting and compensation framework and also introduce new fee-related earnings per share guidance as part of this. And finally, Scott will offer some thoughts both on our year, as well as on our outlook. Turning first to the results. In Page 2 of our supplement, you can see that we have success -- we had a successful year. In the upper left-hand corner of the page, assets under management grew 15% to $252 billion, driven both by investment performance in addition to new capital raised, 2020 was a record fundraising year for us. In turn, management fees grew by 16% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Looking at the bottom left-hand corner, book value per share continued to compound. At year-end, our book value per share was $23.09, representing a 20% increase from a year ago. And finally, on the bottom right-hand side, after-tax distributable earnings increased 8% to $1.5 billion for the year. When you look at this pace more broadly from 2016 to 2020, we’ve seen our AUM and management fees grow at compound annual growth rates of 18% and 15%, respectively. Book value per share has compounded 17% annually. And remember, in addition to this compounding, dividends are being paid out alongside. And with the growth and the earnings power of the firm and unrealized carry and embedded gains in our balance sheet both at record levels as of 12/31, we’re well-positioned to see an acceleration in earnings growth from here. Now let’s dive a little deeper into our results for the quarter. Please turn to Page 3 of the supplement. Focusing on our revenues, management fees of $393 million are up 24% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and increased 9% just from last quarter, driven by fee-paying AUM growth, as well as $22 million of catch-up management fees related to capital raised and strategies that had already begun investment period. Net transaction and monitoring fees were up nicely. Capital Markets fees of $193 million is the strongest quarterly figure we’ve reported in two years. Fees here continued to be diversified across geographies, with a little over 40% of revenues for the quarter and the year, coming from each of the U.S. and Europe, with about 15% coming from Asia. And realized performance income and realized investment income totaled $392 million. That number is right on top of the $390 million update we issued in December. Notable contributors this quarter include monetizations at Pfizer and Epicor, as well as just over $100 million in incentive fees at Marshall Wace. On a blended basis, our key exits this quarter were done at over 2 times costs. Turning to our expenses. Compensation, including equity base comp, was $376 million apply -- implying a 35% compensation margin for the quarter and bringing our comp margin for the year to 38.7%, well inside of the low 40%s total comp ratio we discussed on these calls now for some time. You did see a modestly greater skew towards equity-based comp in the quarter as we issued some stock to employees as part of our year-end comp process. And remember, as always, our intent is to repurchase shares and offset dilution from shares issued to employees over time. Non-compensation operating expenses came in at $124 million, essentially flat year-over-year. So for the quarter, we’re reporting after-tax distributable earnings of $431 million, or $0.49 per share, up 11% on a per share basis relative to Q4 of 2019. And looking at the results for the full-year on the right-hand side, we’re really proud of the results you see on the page. Despite all of the market volatility and challenges over 2020, management fees increased 16%, capital markets fees increased 17%, aggregate revenues increased 8%. And with 150 basis points of margin improvement, operating earnings were up 11%. And while after-tax DE per share for the year compares favorably to 2019, it’s worth noting that we completed the majority of our financings related to Global Atlantic in Q3, which has burdened our after-tax DE per share in advance of the revenues and earnings associated with the acquisition. And in addition to these P&L metrics, you’ve seen continued acceleration in our fundraising, new capital raised in 2020 totaled $44 billion, a 72% increase compared to 2019. More on this in a couple of minutes. Moving to Page 4, you see our investment performance. This has continued to be a real strength for the firm. In 2020, our flagship private equity funds returned 32%, well ahead of the 17% and 18% total return figures of the MSCI World and S&P 500 indices. Performance here was strongest in the Americans, driven by number of digital and tech-oriented investments, as well as strong performance in some of our carve outs, Americas XII appreciated 48% over the year. In real estate, our flagship opportunistic funds appreciated 8%, which compares quite favorably to its benchmark, which appreciated 1% and negative performance across major REIT indices. And our Infrastructure III funds had a gross return of 3% well above its benchmark, which declined 7% in 2020. And our more mature Infrastructure II fund had an excellent year, appreciating 34% driven by a number of sizable monetizations. Our alternative credit flagship funds had a strong Q4, up 9% for the quarter to finish flat for the year. And as an update, our dislocation fund, which we launched in the midst of the pandemic, has continued its strong start up 16% in the fourth quarter and for the year is up over 50% on an unannualized basis. In leveraged credit, which is the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, the composite was up 7% for the year, compared to 3.8% for the LSTA. Looking at page five of the deck, investment performance has helped us continue to raise capital. We raised $12 billion in Q4 and a record $44 billion for the year, up over 70% from 2019. Notably, we brought in $17 billion of AUM for Asia strategies in 2020, representing almost 40% of new capital raised. Asia Real Estate and Asian Infrastructure both held their final closes in Q4, wrapping up two very successful first time fundraisers for us. And on top of our success in Asia, we’ve grown up our core platform this quarter, with capital raised in core PE, as well as the first dollars raised in our new core infrastructure strategy. And it’s worth highlighting the continued scaling of the real estate platform, driven by new capital raised at our Asia and Americas opportunistic strategies, as well as core plus real estate, AUM across the platform has increased from $9 billion a year ago to over $25 billion pro forma for GA. And we continue to have a lot of growth opportunities ahead of us. We’re highlighting this on the right-hand side of the page. Looking at strategies in the market or expected to come to market over the next two years. We have four flagship strategies, 20 plus additional strategies, with GA on top of that. And I have two final items to touch on before turning the call over to Rob. First, consistent with historical practice, we’re pleased to announce an increase in our annual dividend per share from $0.54 to $0.58. This change will go into effect beginning with any dividends to be announced for the first quarter of 2021. And second, we’re excited to announce that we’ll be hosting a virtual Investor Day, the morning of April 14th. To discuss our business in more detail and also focus on the growth we see over the coming years. We hope that you’ll be able to join us then. And with that, I’d like to turn the call over Rob.
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. Turning our attention to Global Atlantic, as announced last week, we closed on our acquisition of GA on February the 1st. I wanted to provide some key updates. Between signing and closing, assets of GA have increased significantly. We had an oversubscribed equity co-investment process that allowed us to bring down our ownership to approximately 60% our desired level, while raising primary capital for GA at the same time. The long-term impact that we expect GA to have on our financials has increased considerably compared to the figures discussed when the transaction was announced in July 2020. And most importantly, we continue to work exceptionally well with a broad GA team. Let me spend a few minutes on some of the details. First, in terms of GA’s footprint, AUM has increased from $72 billion at announcement to $90 billion at 12/31, an increase of roughly 25%. This growth in AUM between signing and closing was well ahead of our expectations. The strength of GA’s platform was clearly evident in both its individual channel. GA has strong embedded relationships here with over 200 banks and broker dealers in addition to its institutional channel, where it’s a leader in block, pension risk transfer and flow reinsurance. Of particular note, GA reinsured over $16 billion in three separate block acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. So the fundamentals of the business required remained compelling. Slide six of the supplement updates you on what this asset growth does for some of our important operating metrics. Taking a look at the top half of the slide, you could see the impact on KKR as AUM, which increases 36% to $342 billion. As all of these assets will immediately hit our fee paying AUM, this acquisition results in a 48% increase in that figure from $186 billion to just over $275 billion. We now manage approximately $120 billion on behalf of insurance companies and believe we are well positioned to further partner with insurance balance sheets over time. I think the bottom half of this page is particularly worth calling out. As you’ll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 5 times from $22 billion to $112 billion. And we now have 43% of our capital base that is either perpetual or with multi-decade recycling provisions. And 86% of our capital overall will now have a contractual life of over eight years from inception. GA provides more scale and it does so in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us all at once. As GA’ investment manager we are focused on bringing our asset management and origination expertise to there on behalf of Global Atlantic and its policyholders. GA already had a strong investment track record and an accomplished team of investment professionals. Working together, we believe we can further improve GA’s risk adjusted return profile. Now, as it relates to the transaction itself, GA was acquired for $4.7 billion or one-time its book value at close. Following the successful co-investment process that was led by our capital markets team, we now have an approximate 60% interest in GA and we were also able to raise $250 million of primary capital, which really does set the business up nicely for future organic and inorganic growth. Of the $4.7 billion purchase price, plus $250 million primary raise, we funded our share, which is approximately $3 billion through the $1.9 billion of proceeds raised in our August mandatory convertible and senior note issuances, with the remainder coming from cash on our balance sheet. In terms of our financial results, you’ll remember that there are really two ways that GA impacts our distributable earnings. The first are the management fees we generate as GA’s investment manager. When we announced the transaction in July, we mentioned that we expect net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work with GA. This reflects management fees we earn as GA’s investment manager, as well as fees generated on assets that we manage directly. This figure is net of operating expenses, which in part relate to strategies that we aren’t investing directly. Given the increase in GA’s assets since the announcement of the deal, our confidence around exceeding the $200 million target has certainly increased. The second way that GA impacts our P&L is through our share of their operating earnings. As noted earlier, GA’s book value is approximately $5 billion. For illustrative purposes, which can help your modeling, if you assume the 12% to 13% ROE and took our 60% share, that would suggest annual earnings in the range of $360 million to 390 million running through our financials. These earnings will show up in our P&L through our insurance segment operating earnings. In terms of our financial reporting, GA is now majority on subsidiary. So we will consolidate their financials into our GAAP earnings starting in Q1. As it relates to our segment results, we will be introducing a new insurance segment that would disclose certain financial information, including our share with their adjusted operating earnings that I just referenced. We will then use this profitability measure in our walk to KKR total distributable earnings. I’ll review a prototype of our segment earnings in just a few minutes. Now, this all leads nicely into the second topic related to some important changes we’re making in our reporting and compensation framework more broadly in 2021. Looking at page seven of the supplement, we feel that we have never had better line of sight, better visibility into our management fees as we do right now. With GA, we’ve added a significant stream of perpetual management fees. Additionally, as you heard earlier from Craig, management fees across KKR continued to scale and we’re in the early stages of an active fundraising cycle that includes raises across a number of our larger benchmark strategies. Putting these two dynamics together, we have increased visibility in our fee revenue, as well as meaningful confidence in our ability to scale from here. As a result, we now have an opportunity to change our compensation framework in a way that we think should really benefit our shareholders. Currently, we talk about comp and comp margins as a percentage of our total distributable revenues. Our historical guidance here has targeted a low 40s overall comp margin. But that compensation figure has been a single number based on all forms of revenue. Starting in 2021, we are going to decouple our compensation into its component pieces. Let me walk through the changes to our framework before pulling it all together, please take a look at page eight. The first piece relates to fee-related compensation. We expect our fee-related revenue to have an annual cash comp load in the range of 20% to 25%. To be clear, given our line of sight and outlook around our fee revenues, we believe this range allows for a base level of comp to be paid across the firm in all operating environments, including years where monetization are more challenged. In terms of our other forms of compensation, for our realized performance revenue, which is primarily driven by carried interest, our range of annual cash comp is expected to be 60% to 70%. Our realized investment income from our balance sheet will have an expected cash comp load of 10% to 20%. We believe this change will benefit KKR shareholders in a number of ways. First, it will enhance the transparency of how our compensation pool gets formed and the profits we derived from our three forms of revenue. It will also create better alignment, as compensation at KKR will become even more success based and aligned with the realized investment performance of our funds. We think this change is advantageous for both our public shareholders, as well as our fund limited partners. And from a P&L perspective, this change delivers a much higher flow through of our fee-related earnings to our shareholders. We believe this will also provide greater line of sight to the drivers of the growth and margin expansion of our FRE going forward. And finally, we believe this change will make the economics from our balance sheet clear. Our balance sheet is positioned to generate excellent returns. We have averaged 21.5% over the last two years. And it does so without any fixed expenses, which are all borne by our fee revenues, and our modest and variable comp load. When you take a step back and compare these characteristics to other balance sheets, we think this is fairly unique, and with continued performance, we believe these attributes will lead to a higher multiple being applied to our balance sheet over time. Now even though we are breaking out of compensation into its component parts, we will continue to track our aggregate compensation margin, including equity-based comp. In a normalized operating environment, you should expect our comp ratio to be roughly in line with our current levels. In an environment where we have elevated levels of successful monetization, our comp margin is likely to tick up a bit. But in a more challenging environment where our monetization is are lower, you should also expect to see our comp margins go down, which will provide some level of added protection to our operating earnings. Let me repeat this part, as it’s a really important piece to be clear on, these changes are not about increasing compensation on the enterprise. As an example, if we applied the midpoint of our new compensation ranges to our actual 2020 revenues, our compensation margin would have been 38.6%. This compares to our reported comp margin of 38.7% for the year. So this change is really about how our comp pool is calculated and creating more visibility and flow through of our fee revenues to our shareholders, while adding a bit more variability in our comp margin based on our performance. And we are confident we can achieve that while not increasing the overall compensation paid by the firm. In connection with these changes, you’ll see that we expect to make a couple of adjustments to our financial reporting to bring it more in line with our peer set and allow for easier comparability for our investors and analysts. The first change is to build to a new simplified fully burdened fee related earnings figure with individual compensation components as described a minute ago. On this page, you can see KKR’s distributable operating earnings as you think of them today, but now titled Asset Management Operating Earnings. This will then be added to our share of GA’s earnings to arrive at a total distributable operating earnings line as you work your way towards after-tax distributable earnings. Please note that we’ve included a more detailed prototype of our segments financial profile and definitions in the appendix on pages 10 and 11. In addition, consistent with our peers, when calculating after-tax distributable earnings going forward, we will no longer include equity-based compensation as an expense. At this point, we believe we are one of the few alternative asset management firms that reflect equity based compensation as an expense in our reported total distributable earnings. This has been a source of confusion at times, in particular, as investors look at relative valuation multiples. So we’re going to conform to our peers and make it easier for our shareholders to compare results. Equity-based compensation will of course still be disclosed in our earnings release, and as we think about aggregate compensation and comp margins, it will be a key input. But it will not be included within our reported after-tax PE or after-tax PE per share metrics. And finally, let me spend a minute on our fee-related earnings. Given all of our growth avenues and the visibility that I spoke of earlier, we see a clear path for FRE to comfortably exceed $2 per share for 2022. This anticipated growth will be in spite of some large investments we intend to make across technology and distribution and marketing over the next couple of years, which we believe will benefit our FRE and DE well beyond 2022. We know FRE is an important financial metric to our investors and we intend to provide periodic updates on our progress. And with that, let me hand it off to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you everybody for joining our call today. Given everything already covered, I’m going to be brief. First, a quick comment on Global Atlantic. The GA transaction is highly strategic for KKR. It meaningfully expands our base of permanent capital, further diversifies and scales our business, and significantly grows our position within the insurance industry. The acquisition also improves the quality and visibility of our earnings. And GE’s strong and experienced management team is a critical element of this transaction. We see a number of growth opportunities working with our new partners. In short, this is a meaningful development for us and we look forward to keeping you posted on our collective progress. Second, a couple thoughts on KKR more broadly. As a senior team, we just spent the better part of a week in our annual strategic planning meetings. Listening to the discussions and presentations in those sessions was incredibly energizing. In our nearly 45 years in business, we have never had a stronger management team, more line of sight to our near-term results, more ways to grow and more confidence in our future. This confidence is driving our announcements today and sharing our belief that we can comfortably exceed $2 per share in FRE next year. And even more exciting, we see significant growth beyond that. We know we have discussed a lot of information on this call. That is one of the reasons we’re looking forward to our April Investor Day. We think it will be helpful for example for everyone to hear Global Atlantic CEO, Allan Levine talk about GA and its growth prospects. We’ll also spend a significant amount of time detailing the building blocks of the firm’s growth plans, which we think will help you understand why we are so optimistic about the path ahead for us. We thank you for your partnership, trust and time, and are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions and thanks for the enhanced disclosure. It is super helpful. Maybe tying together two of the points you guys are highlighting. Could you unpack for us maybe the walk up to the $2 number plus for 2022, between maybe the legacy KKR platform versus GA, just given where the assets are your ownership -- perform ownership versus at the time of the deal? And then, Rob, just a point of clarification, when you mentioned your scenarios with the comp ratios and up down realization backdrop, I was a little confused by the ratio being down, would that become ratio being down or the FRE margin being down if monetization is down? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Bill, for the questions. To be clear that was the -- if we have lower monetizations, lower successful monetizations, our anticipation is that our comp ratio would be going down as we’re making compensation at KKR more success-based. In terms of your question around 2022 FRE, that was really a combination of a bunch of different things that’s given us confidence and being able to achieve that target out into the future. I’d say, the first is management fees coming across our existing platform through our different products and geographies and the scaling that Craig referenced earlier in the call. Second piece of it is clearly the increased confidence that we have in Global Atlantic and their scaling of assets and our ability to work constructively with them. We also continue to see a lot of opportunities to scale the breadth of our products and what we cover in our Capital Markets business, as well as different clients. And so when you add all that together, inclusive of ensuring that that we monitor expense management, we feel really good that we should be able to comfortably exceed $2 per share of FRE in 2022.
Bill Katz: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Glenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. Curious your thoughts on the current or -- let’s just call it 2021 realization backdrop. M&A is super active, stacks are even more active, markets are at their highs. I’m just curious on how you balance those thoughts with the investment opportunities that are out there because you have some of your flagship funds that are only say, half invested. I know we’re trying to get to the other side for more capital. So curious on how you see that landscape?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Hi, Glenn. It’s Rob. Thanks for the question. And Scott will probably jump in here at some point as well. Listen, we’re very constructive from a monetization perspective. And if you look at our Q1 line of sight in terms of realized carry and balance sheet revenue, as we sit here today, we feel really good that we’ve got deals that are signed and are closed that would represent greater than $375 million of revenue in Q1. And so we agree that the market backdrop is one that that’s quite an interesting one as it relates to being able to monetize investments.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. And Glenn, so I’d say, look, we agree with your comment. We’re very constructive on the backdrop for monetizations broadly and it is across the Board. There’s M&A. There’s strategic sales. There are sales to sponsors. There’s leverage recaps, dividends, so a lot of different opportunities for us to monetize. I would also say, though, despite the overall valuation environment, we continue to be very active in terms of deployment. As we talked about in the last call, we’ve been really leaning into a number of investment themes that we think will be accelerated by this period of time and so our pipelines are actually quite full as we head through the first quarter here.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Blostein: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we cannot pack the trajectory for management fee growth a little bit more. It sounds like fundraising momentum is really strong. If we look at the deployment activity in the quarter, I think, it’s been -- it was one of the best we’ve seen in a long time from you guys. So, all of that feels like we could see a little bit of fast -- a little faster kind of turning on to the fees in some of the larger fund. So maybe kind of help us bridge kind of standalone KKR management fees for 2021, 2022 relative to your sort of prior targets of 50% plus growth. And then, Rob, I was hoping we could get a jumping-off point for management fees for GA specifically that will, I guess, start to come in, in the first quarter and how they expect to sort of ramp to that $200 million-plus number that you alluded to? Thanks.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Thanks a lot, Alex. And maybe I’ll take the second part of your question first and then head back to the first part of it. So I think it’d be probably helpful for us to break down the net management fees from Global Atlantic that we expect to receive in a few different pieces. The first is that we will have an IMA across GA’s asset base. We have agreed with the regulators that our fee there will not be in excess of 30 basis points. We also intend to manage assets directly for GA where we’ll charge the relevant fee rates for other similarly large investors in those strategies, offsetting both of those two fee revenue lines are some expenses, which include paying other investment managers who perform services that KKR does not perform today. The net of those three items together is really what generates the $200 million of net management fee revenue that we expect to be able to achieve a couple of years out that we talked about earlier, as well as our belief that we’ve got a path to a higher number over a similar period of time. I’d say, we don’t have an exact time table as when those numbers will effectively be generated in large part because of the need to ramp up our own direct origination as GA’s investment manager, but we feel really good and being able to achieve these numbers a couple of years from now. And so as you think about year one, which I know you asked about explicitly, I’d say, that we feel good about achieving somewhere around half to two-thirds of our $200-plus million target in year one of our investment here and partnership with Global Atlantic. In terms of the second part of your question. So, obviously, we feel good about the trajectory of GA and a good start that I think we’re going to have in year one and being able to ramp. I’d say, we feel incrementally better about our ability to achieve 50%-plus management fee growth over, I think, we said between 2019 and 2022. And so our expectation, as you think about our 2022 FRE is that we should be north of that number, but we don’t have any further guidance on the specifics.
Alex Blostein: Great. Thank you for that.
Craig Larson: Yes. Just one clarifying thing, Alex, on that, just to be clear. The 50-plus percent growth that Rob mentioned was organic before GA. So I think of the punch lines, we feel better about being able to meet or exceed that. And then you’ve got Global Atlantic on top of that, so it gets you to the higher number obviously.
Alex Blostein: Yes. That makes perfect sense. Great. Thanks for all the details guys.
Rob Lewin: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gerry O’Hara with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Gerry O’Hara: Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe just touching on geographic opportunities, Asia has been clearly a source of strength throughout 2020 both in terms of fundraising, but I think also other capital metrics. Perhaps you could give us a little color on what 2021 might have in store for outlook just in terms of some of the channel capital formation trends? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hi, Jerry. It’s Craig. Why don’t I start there, and I think, Scott may add on. So look, I think, in many ways when we think of deployment, the interesting aspect here really relates to the increasing balance of the firm. So historically private markets deployment was clearly driven by private equity and we’ve seen in the last handful of years. You’re correct, Asia, be very strong for us and I think we do expect deployment in the region again to be active as Scott had alluded to earlier. But I think in many ways, one of the other interesting points here really relates to the growth in real assets footprint for us, so infrastructure, real estate energy. And I think, there is a real opportunity for more balanced deployment for us given that scaling. So infra at this point, the business is global. The team is busy everywhere. In real estate, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth of the platform. We’ve seen a significant ramp. So I think, overall, we look at the opportunity for us as being meaningful given the various pools of capital that we have really across geographies.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I’d add Gerry is that, it -- we continue to see these opportunities across a number of these investment themes that we’ve discussed. And Asia, of course, is at the most part come out of the COVID period more quickly than other parts of the world. And so we are kind of seeing more regular activity levels on the ground in a number of those markets.
Gerry O’Hara: Helpful. Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning, guys. My question is on the kind of compensation shift. Does this come with kind of explicit discussions with employees that going to be paid difference in years with few realizations? I guess in another words, do we have your assurance that in a bad realization you’re not suddenly going to have a 30% or 35% FRE compensation ratio? And through that lens do you worry this could create retention issues and bad realization years that people are getting paid meaningfully less than other firms.
Rob Lewin: Yes. Hi, Patrick. It’s Rob. Let me start off. So I think a really important component of this change is the fact that we feel like we’re able to make this change today given the scaling of our management fee growth based on what we’ve had historically and what we see prospectively over the next couple of years, inclusive of the GA acquisition. And so we feel today that we’re at that inflection point where we will be able to compensate our firm based on the fee revenues that we have today in downside scenarios. In terms of employee communication, of course, this is something that we’ve been closely linked up with our senior employees on, and I would say, this type of change impacts our senior employees by far the most. And a couple of comments there, one, our senior employees are all big shareholders of KKR and we think that this is certainly a benefit to our shareholders. That’s why we did it. We think our senior employees are also more used to more variability and their annual compensation based on performance. Frankly, it’s something I think they like as part of their overall compensation framework. And as we think about being competitive in the market for talent, we certainly see that dynamic where for senior talent there is more variability and compensation for performance.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Patrick. It’s Scott. Just to jump on, I think, the basic question is, do we plan to stick to it. The answer is yes. We’ve been talking about this potential change internally for the last few years and working to Rob’s point to get to the scale and diversity and visibility where we thought, we could tell you this and stick to it. And you know us well, right, we are deliberate people, we are very careful about what we commit to and we do not intend to let you or our shareholders down. So we would not announce this unless we’re confident we can deliver in these comp ranges in all operating environments. And to Rob’s point, yes, we talked about this with the partners of the firm. Everybody gets the alignment. We own over 30% or 35% of the stock, give or take. So we think it’s the right change and we’ve kind of been building toward it for the last several years.
Patrick Davitt: Great. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Craig Siegenthaler: I wanted to come back to your comments on our Global Atlantic. So we will launch GA expand in the disability with the year end transaction last year. So I wanted to see if you could talk about some of the other insurance verticals that GA could expand into really outside of annuities and could we see additional disability transactions in 2021?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Craig. It’s Scott. First off, I think, you’re right, we did the transaction with the book was the disability book. It was -- suffice it to say it was structured in such a way that it was much closer to an annuity book and a disability book in terms of what it means for us. So it really is not us taking different kinds of risks at Global Atlantic. It’s more just the transaction was structured to make it the risk that we want to take. And as we talked about the prior calls, we really like that the GA team is very focused on taking particular kinds of risks. So you shouldn’t take that as any change in strategy. In terms of the other insurance verticals, I think, for the time being you should expect that we’re going to stay focused on annuities, life and the other existing businesses of Global Atlantic. We don’t have any plans to meaningfully change that and we’ll continue to execute that through the individual channel and the institutional channel as we’ve discussed in its various forms. But we’ll keep you posted. Never say never in terms of the evolution of the strategy, but we’re focused on what got us here.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Devin Ryan: Okay. Great. Good morning, everyone.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Devin Ryan: I want to ask a question here on the capital markets business and really just trying to get a little bit more context around how the platform is scaled over the past couple of years or any stats you can provide around the size, number of people, any incremental capabilities. Really what I’m just looking to kind of think about is parsing through what’s been a very good backdrop for the business and obviously you guys have evolved here versus how the broader platform has grown? And then just kind of as a follow on to that, any additional color for what you’re expecting on the business for 2021?
Rob Lewin: Hey, Devin. Let me take that one. So I think it’s a really good question. As we think about the scaling of our capital markets platform, I’d say, it’s really in three components. The first was really around geographic breadth. And as you know this business started really as predominantly a U.S. centric business, but we’ve got a highly skilled team of capital markets professionals that today are all over the world supporting KKRs businesses all over the world, we talked about it earlier. But KKRs capital deployment for the year was pretty well spread out between the Americas, Europe and Asia, and that was all covered by our capital markets team. Second thing is really about building out the product capability to be able to follow KKRs evolution from a product standpoint. So as we’ve expanded into asset classes like infrastructure and real estate and aspects of structured and principal credit. Our capital markets team has fallen alongside and we’ve gone out and recruited what we think is best-in-class talent to cover those areas. And then the last piece of it is really our approach, what we think -- a really unique approach to non-KKR clients and being able to cover those clients, being able to speak for capital structures. We think in a really unique way in a way that’s highly coordinated with our credit pools of capital as well. And that’s our expanding part of our business in the U.S., but also in Europe and in aspects of Asia as well. We’re starting to get some real traction. And so I think when you add that altogether, that’s why you’re seeing scaling of that business over time and that duration of that business. As we look out a few years, we certainly see continued meaningful growth over and above the levels that we’ve been operating in over the last couple of years. So we’re excited about the outlook for that business and what we think it could become over time.
Devin Ryan: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey. Thanks, guys, and thanks for all the great color today with the new info. It’s very helpful. Just wanted to check in here with maybe a little bit more of a simplistic question, for newer investors coming to KKR taking a look that $2 plus FRE target in 2022 is very helpful. I might also be hoping to get some color on the growth algorithm for FRE going forward? Scott, you had noted earlier that the prior fee revenue guide was 50%, which kind of translates to mid-teens topline CAGR, but that didn’t include insurance. And then Rob, I think you had mentioned also some potential for FRE margin expansion. So, kind of just putting these pieces together over time would it be fair to think about a medium to long run FRE growth cadence of somewhere in the mid-teens, mid-teens plus?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. So, we’re not going to on this call provide guidance beyond 2022 and I think as we get to our Investor Day in April, we could provide a little bit more substance about what we see from a longer term growth trajectory perspective. Suffice it to say that we’ve got a lot of things that have quite a bit of momentum across the firm right now still a number of young strategies. So it’s not just about the next two years growth, in terms of how we see our platform developing. And we think, asset management, capital markets and insurance will all be growers in a fairly robust way over the next several years and not just over the next couple.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Jeremy. It’s Scott. Look it’s an astute question. We’ll try to shed some light directionally for you in April.
Jeremy Campbell: Got it. Thanks guys.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Carrier: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just given the growth you’ve seen in book value, you now have GA business and then the strategic outlook. Just curious, any change or shift in how you’re thinking about the balance sheet, including level of monetization and capital management moving forward?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Hey Mike. No change. We’re going to go through the same process we go through every year as we think about our balance sheet and how we manage our capital allocation. The first point is always is how we think about return of capital to shareholders. As you know, this quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend from $0.54 to $0.58. Craig also noted in his prepared remarks that we’re going to continue to opportunistically over time repurchase shares to keep our share count flat for employee dilution. And then, most importantly is to be able to strategically reinvest our capital base back into our business for growth. There is no better example of that type of transaction than what we were able to accomplish this past year with Global Atlantic.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Mike. It’s Scott. Just one other thing, as you know, we remain very focused on compounding, just compounding our AUM, compounding our balance sheet. We think the additional Global Atlantic will allow us to do both of those things at a faster rate over time. So no change is expected.
Mike Carrier: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Lee: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Since -- maybe I’ll try to squeeze in a two-part. The first one is, first part of it is, can you maybe update us just giving the robust fundraising you’ve had and your robust outlook? Maybe update us on kind of your cross-sell within your LP base and any kind of metrics you can share like how many of your LPs are invested in two to three or more products and kind of where your penetration of Global LP stands? And then second part is really going back to an earlier question, you guys have always been known for having I believe kind of one comp pool and plus the firm as opposed having people have specific points on specific funds per se. I’m assuming with the changes that that your traditional approach to your comp pool hasn’t changed?
Craig Larson: Hey, Rob. It’s Craig. Why don’t I take the first part of that and thanks for the question on cross-selling. Look, I think, we continue to make very good progress at year end. We were at about 1,200 investors at this point, approaching that level and that continues to be a real focus for us, first in terms of increasing the overall breadth of our LP base. We held as we mentioned the final close in the fourth quarter of our Asia Infrastructure fund. And 25% of the LPs in that fund are new fund investors to KKR. We love seeing statistics like that. And then as it relates to the cross-sell, at this point, we’re about two products per client. We’ve seen that number continue to migrate up, but it migrates up slowly honestly, because as you’re adding clients. You’re typically adding the one product at a time. Our largest category of client averages almost five products per client. So I think as we look overall, we still see significant opportunities for us both in terms of increasing the overall number of LPs, as well as those cross-sell statistics. And I think in addition to that, when we think of areas like us and retail again see continued long-term opportunities for us.
Rob Lewin: Yes. And on the second part of your question, Rob, no change. What we’re really talking about is how the compensation pool is calculated. We’re not changing in terms -- the approach we’ve taken, which we think is really important culturally for us that everybody participates in everything. So it’s more about the -- how the aggregate is calculated, how it’s shared.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Harris: Yes. Hey, Rob. How should we be thinking about the tax rate on a pro forma basis. And then the insurance segment operating earnings that you highlighted of $360 million to $390 million, is that pretax or an after-tax number?
Rob Lewin: Yes. So as we build up our P&L we’re going to show our insurance segment on an after-tax basis to answer your question specifically there and as it relates to KKRs overall tax expense, no change to prior guidance. Overtime, we would expect to see our tax rate migrate up to statutory rate in the low 20s, but that will take some time as we start off quite a bit deferred tax asset from the C-Corp conversion a couple years back.
Scott Nuttall: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Cyprus: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the comp changes, maybe just on the equity comp, that’s now excluded from the earnings framework going forward, just curious what the outlook is for equity comp to grow from there. I think it was $246 million level or so here in 2020. And then could you also just talk about the underpinning for the 60% to 70% carried interest comp ratio, just how you thought about setting that I think it’s a bit different from maybe where it was five years or six years ago and a little bit different from some of the peers. So just curious how you’re thinking about that?
Rob Lewin: Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, Mike. So on equity-based comp, one, it’s very important to understand, as we look at aggregate compensation margin, we’re going to continue to do that and we’re going to continue to look at that inclusive of equity-based comp and it’s a core component. As you think about 2021, the expectation should be that we should have modest growth in that line item commensurate with the growth of the firm. So, as you noted, we were in the mid-$240s in 2020. I could see that number being in the $250 million to $300 million range in 2021. And as we thought about the 60% to 70% comp margin on performance revenues, a lot of different variables went into that inclusive of how we thought about comp ranges on our other forms of revenue. We also looked at the competitive framework, not just some of the big alternatives firms that went public at the same time of us, but some firms that went public after us with different comp ratios and we thought about the competitive dynamic with our own people and the number of firms that we compete against for talent that have compensation pools on carried interest that are effectively 100%. And so it was a really looking at all of those different factors and coming up with the range of 60% to 70% that we thought was appropriate.
Michael Cyprus: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arnaud Giblat with Exane. Please proceed with your question.
Arnaud Giblat: Yes. So it’s Arnaud Giblat from Exane BNP. A quick question please. Can you talk about the opportunities you see to grow Global Atlantic through bolt-on deals? And more generally, do you see opportunities to accelerate growth targeted in new strategies through bolt-ons? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: Thank you for the question. The short answer is, we see a significant number of ways we and Global Atlantic can grow together. I think the first and the primary focus is going to be doing that on an organic basis. And so the business itself really goes to market in two channels. The first is the individual channel where we have distribution relationships with 200 plus bank and broker dealers. So you should expect us to continue to scale organically through that channel. Secondly is the institutional channel where it’s really executed in three different ways, blocks which Rob mentioned, we did $16 billion in Q3 and Q4 last year. But there is also flow reinsurance relationships, there is pension risk transfer opportunities until we see at least those three different ways to grow institutionally as well. So the primary focus right now is growing organically through those different channels and relationships. There are opportunities to your point also consider acquisitions over time. The Global Atlantic management team has done a number of acquisitions through their history and then it could also be another opportunity for us as we go forward. Nothing on the drawing board right now, but that is an opportunity to your point is something that we’re keeping an eye on. And then I would also say the last thing that we’re focused on. Although, it’s going to take a good amount of time and energy in the near-term here in particular is ways that we could jointly developed products and then also potentially leverage Global Atlantic’s distribution for things that KKR is doing. And so that could be another area of growth for us as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning and thank you. I wanted to go back to how we should expect to see the Global Atlantic revenues flowing through the P&L since for all ramping up our models and starting over anyway? But presumably the 30 basis points or let’s call it 25 basis points that goes against or under the IMA, presumably that hits upfront and so, say, if you figure 25 basis points on $90 billion that’s somehow kind of like $225 million gross that you would have? And so presumably there is $100 million of expense or thereabouts of expense and comp that goes against that. And then presumably over time as you move those assets into your fund strategies, then we should see the revenues build up? Is that kind of the way we should think about it as we model out the next four or six, eight quarters?
Rob Lewin: Yes. Thanks Chris. Look, I think, you’re directionally in the right ballpark. And that’s right as we built up to the net $200 million plus over the next couple of years. We got there through the IMA fee. We got there through on an assumption around how we’re going to ramp up investing assets directly on behalf of GA, offsetting that with the amount of investment expenses and other expenses that we’ll need to bear inclusive of other asset managers for the GA balance sheet. Today we are doing things KKR doesn’t do. And so when you add all those things together, you’re getting to that $200 plus number. And as you think about year one, our ability to achieve 50% to 75% -- 50%, excuse me, to two-thirds of that seems reasonably in line with the math that you went through.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. And just if I could squeeze in one more. When I did back of the envelope kind of reverse engineering your comp ratio for 2020 I got to something around 36% using your methodology, it will be slightly lower than what we actually saw, could that be right?
Rob Lewin: No. As we looked at it and if we looked at the midpoint of the ranges that we outlined, it’s a 38.6% number.
Chris Kotowski: Okay.
Rob Lewin: And just to be clear because I think it could impact some of your numbers, as we think about the incentive fees against Marshall Wace we’re assuming that that gets comped in the balance sheet revenue, a number of 10% to 20% comp range as opposed to our realized performance revenue number and that’s what could be creating a little bit of delta with some of your numbers.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. And then thanks for all the color and clarification really helpful. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one back on the FRE confidence of over $2? Maybe if you just comment on a little bit on the fundraising side of that, it looks to me like you’d be able to exceed the 2020 annual level of fundraising each of the next two years based on the fund profile? So I just wanted to sanity check if that seems right given and maybe I guess the flagship component of that obviously would be large and just sort of the cadence of timing of that. And then what you’re assuming for capital markets business fees in that $2, is that the level of 2020 at least or do we expect growth on that?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Brian. It’s Scott. We’re not going to be able to share with you kind of fundraising guidance or capital markets revenue guidance. I think if you look at page five of the supplemental materials, you can see on the right-hand side, all of the strategies we have coming to market, including the number of flagship strategies. And so, I think as long as the fundraising environment stays with us and it’s probably frankly improved a bit since the last time we talked. We do feel good about our ability to meaningfully scale our AUM from here and have good fundraising outcomes in the next couple of years. We’re not going to put a precise number on it, but we feel good on a kind of a team in place basis and then we’re also making new investments in distribution as well that we’ll talk about more in April. Capital markets had a very nice year last year after a quiet spring given the pandemic. And we do see real opportunities to scale there as well. We’ve incorporated all of that go into kind of the FRE guidance we gave you, where we said, we could comfortably exceed $2 per share. That is incorporated into that statement and that guidance and the outcomes we think can be a bit fungible, but both fundraising KCM, Global Atlantic and all the other ways we have to win re incorporated in that message.
Brian Bedell: Great. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson: So thank you everybody for your time and attention. We know that we had a number of items to impact this quarter. We’re always available of course for any follow-ups. In saying that, we look forward to seeing everybody, starting with everybody next quarter and again at the April Investor Day event. So thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the KKR's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, good morning everybody and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm joined by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and also by Rob Lewin our CFO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. We've all experienced volatility and disruption in many ways in 2020 across the globe. So we continue to hope that everyone is safe and healthy. But in terms of KKR, and our results this quarter, we've continued to see strong performance really across all of our metrics. Turning to Page 2 of our supplement to begin, you can see that our key metrics are performing nicely. Looking at the upper left hand part of the page, assets under management came in at $234 billion, representing a 12% increase from a year ago. And as fundraising and capital deployment momentum continued, our management fees of the past 12 months as you can see by the chart in the right hand top right hand corner grew by 13% to $1.3 billion. Looking at the bottom left, you can see our book value per share. So a meaningful increase this quarter. This is by strong investment performance. In the third quarter, book value per share grew from $17.73 as of 6/30, the $20.26, up 14%, and more broadly is up 11% from $18.22 per share a year ago. And finally on the bottom right hand side, you see our after-tax distributable earnings. First, in terms of this quarter, DE came in at $410 million or $0.48 on a per share basis. Both of these figures are up approximately 25% from our results last quarter. And looking over the last 12 months despite all of the volatility we've endured, we reported $1.5 billion of after tax DE, which is essentially flat compared to the figure from a year ago. Moving on to our summary financials for the third quarter, please turn to Page 3 of the supplement, and let's walk through the left hand part of that slide. Management fees increased to $360 million, up 14% to Q3 last year, driven most significantly by Asia IV, which entered its investment period in the quarter. Transaction fees totaled $301 million. We had a strong quarter within capital markets with transaction fees here coming in at $158 million given the breadth of deployment and monetization activities we saw over the course of the quarter. Realized performance income came in at $234 million, and with $260 million of realized investment income. Total revenues were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Notable monetization activity in the quarter included the IPO of Hut Group, a British e-commerce firm, the dividend recapitalization of Epicor, which is a software firm and North America Fund XI, which we subsequently sold, as well as the secondary Pfizer. In on a blended basis, our exits this quarter were done at over three times costs. Turning to our expenses for the quarter. Compensation expenses were $427 million, which brings our total compensation margin including equity based comp to 40%. Non-compensation operating expenses were $90 million. Our operating margin increased to 52% with after tax distributable earnings then of the $410 million or $0.48 per share. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig. And good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, I want to start off by focusing on our year-to-date performance. We've clearly experienced some market volatility in 2020. And we believe our results over the past nine months highlight both the resilience of our business model and the high level of execution by our global teams. I'm going to start with the right hand side of Page 3, focusing initially on three major drivers of our revenue. First, our management fees are up 13% this year. Our ability to realize carry through different market environments also remained strong, bringing our realized performance fees to just under $1 billion year-to-date. And finally, our balance sheet is continued to perform with realized investment income up 8% continuing to demonstrate the important contribution of this revenue stream towards our overall financial performance. In aggregate, our revenues are up 7% through the first nine months of the year. Moving through our expenses, compensation margin has remained at 40% through the year. In terms of non-compensation related expenses, we have been deliberately prudent with expense management in 2020, and have obviously benefited from the limited amount of travel and office related expenses this year. Year-to-date, our other operating expenses together with occupancy are down 4%, compared to this period last year, despite making some very meaningful investments across our platform. As a result, our distributable operating margins are up 100 basis points, while our total operating earnings are up 9%. In addition, our after tax DE per share of $1.28 for the nine months ended September 2020, compares favorably to $1.23 in the same period in 2019. It is important to note here, that we have completed our financing related to Global Atlantic in Q3, which has already started to burden our after tax DE per share in advance of generating the revenue associated with the acquisition. Switching to capital raising. On a year-to-date basis, we have raised 80% more capital than we raised in the same period in 2019, which really does set us up nicely for future growth. Moving to investment performance on Page four, which has largely been a real strength for us this year. Our flagship private equity funds returned 27% over the past 12 months, and our real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 10% and 7% respectively over that same period. In credit, we had a very positive quarter, leverage credit, which is the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 5% in Q3, and is up 3% over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 6% in the quarter, and down 7% LTM. Our alternative credit numbers are a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had solid performance and our distressed portfolio, which has taken some marks LTM. Turning to Page 5, we thought it was worth spending a minute specifically discussing our benchmark PE performance. As you can see, really across all geographies, our flagship private equity funds are meaningfully outperforming their benchmark indices on a since inception basis. This performance is in part generated by our portfolio construction, especially in a bifurcated market like the one we have seen in 2020. We are underweight some of the harder hit sectors, while also importantly choosing to have a large exposure to technology, with a focus on investments in data, ecommerce, and digitalization. Our relative weighting to Asia has also benefited our performance. Page 6 provides some additional detail on our balance sheet. Consistent with the performance across the firm, our book value per share increased to $20.26, representing a 14% increase from June 30. Our balance sheet investment portfolio returned 11% in the quarter, and our net accrued carry balance increased 44% from Q2, providing additional visibility for future carry. Also as it relates to our balance sheet, it's worth highlighting our buyback activity this year. Since January, we've used $324 million under our buyback program. The majority of this activity occurred in the first four months of the year, as we leaned into the volatility and repurchased stock at a weighted average price of just over $24 per share. In total now, since we announced our first buyback program at the end of 2015, we've used $1.4 billion to retire shares at an average price of just under $19 per share. With our book value today in excess of $20 and the stock price where it is, we feel good about our activity levels here. Turning to fundraising. New capital raised totaled $8.7 billion in the quarter driven by fundraising across private markets in our U.S. real estate strategy, as well as across three strategies in Asia, real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. Additionally, we raised capital related to leverage and private credit. New capital raised from a fee paying AUM standpoint was a record $19 billion this quarter, with $12 billion of that attributed to Asia IV as it entered its investment period in July. We now have over $13 billion of capital in Asia IV, I will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress. The $32 billion of capital raised year-to-date importantly sets us up with $67 billion of dry powder, which is a high point for us. As we have discussed on prior calls, we really did lean in when the market was dislocated. So this dry powder is particularly noteworthy given the level of capital investment we have made year-to-date. Now focusing on this deployment more specifically, our private markets business had a record investment quarter with $6.2 billion deployed, which was largely in transactions that were entered into during the more heightened market dislocation in the spring and early summer. In Europe, two previously announced core PE investments closed. Our infrastructure team continued to find compelling opportunities across various sectors in Europe and Asia. And a number of Asia P investments closed, including our investment GI. And finally, an update on a couple of items related to Global Atlantic. We completed two financings in the quarter the proceeds of which will be used to fund the acquisition. In August, we issued $1.15 billion of mandatory convertible preferred stock. You will see in our earnings release on a distributable earning basis that this offering is reported on a as if converted basis. And subsequent to the mandatory convertible offering, we also issued $750 million of 30-year senior notes with a 3.5% coupon. Behind the scenes, the GA team has been hard at work at closing. Following KKR announcement of the acquisition in July, GA completed two block reinsurance transactions, adding an incremental $8 billion of assets. Notably, GA's pipeline for similar transactions is quite active, and we have confidence in the team's ability to execute. We continue to see really strong opportunities here for both organic and inorganic growth. And with that, let me hand it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. All of us at KKR hope you and your families are happy, safe and healthy. Our numbers speak for themselves this quarter. So I'm going to be brief. From my seat, there are a handful of things I thought I would highlight. First, we have invested and committed $42 billion so far this year around the world and across strategies. We were prepared to lean into dislocation coming into the spring, and our preparedness has paid off. Second, investment performance has been strong. And we see more upside in the portfolio from here. Third, fundraising momentum has continued. In the first three quarters, we have raised $32 billion. And we have three more flagship funds and over 20 other strategies in or coming to market over the next 18 months. Fourth, our model is working with our combination of AUM capital markets and balance sheet we have multiple ways to win. We have always felt our model is resilient. One silver lining of this year has been an opportunity for that resilience to shine through. And fifth, the Global Atlantic acquisition is on track. And as you heard from Rob, GA is winning in the marketplace, and will be larger at closing than we had anticipated with multiple ways to grow from here. It has been a busy year, but we have a lot more ahead of us. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from William Katz with Citi.
William Katz: Thank you very much for taking the question. I think you guys answer a little bit of it in some of your prepared commentary. But Scott just sort of wondering rather you guys want to maybe to sort of step back and update us around Vista management fee walk up as you see it another sort of quarter under your belt, just given sort of the outsized economics this quarter and your commentary on the Global Atlantic transaction?
Scott Nuttall: Sure, thanks a lot, Bill. So nothing has changed in our view on management fee growth from here. We communicated a little bit while back that our expectation is that we'll be able to generate 50 plus percent management fee growth. On top of that, we believe there is an additional 200 plus million of net management fee that we would expect to generate from Global Atlantic. And so, I'd say we continue to be convicted on being able to achieve that.
William Katz: Okay. And just a follow-up a big picture, maybe a little bit unanswerable today. But just to the extent that there will be any kind of shift in carried interest taxation. How might that impact the economics or the franchise either bottom line or from a sort of a comp perspective? And then the harder part is to the extent there is any kind of sort of administrative change next week. How might that influence institutional allocations and with the relative appeal of alternatives more broadly?
Robert Lewin: Sure, so as it relates to any changes or around carried interest taxation that won't have an impact on distributable earnings for us all forms of our income, our tax the same and so at the statutory rate. And as you know we benefit from a little bit of a tax step up that we had achieved at our C-Corp conversion, but other than that, any kind of new revenue that comes into the firm is taxed at the statutory rate all the same.
Scott Nuttall: And Bill, just on the other parts of your question it’s Scott. So no impact on the DE, no impact on compensation or how we think about it and with respect to fundraising we do not expect any change in the tax code to have an impact. Remember a lot of the people that invest with us our tax exempts and regardless of what happens from a tax code standpoint. We believe the interest in alternatives will continue to grow.
Operator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks very much, wonder if you could talk a little bit more about alternative credit, you mentioned the performance and the stress is not the biggest piece. But I'm curious on what you see as temporary versus permanent impairments in that book and the outlook more importantly for distress. Because we keep thinking there is a good outlook but every time, every time it happens more stimulus comes and maybe you could tie in to dislocation fund what's going on in the distressed landscape? Thanks so much.
Robert Lewin: Yes, thanks a lot for the question Glenn, this is Rob, I'll start and I'm sure Scott will have some views here as well. I think the punch line is we continue to view a number of assets in our distressed portfolio that have taken some marks on an LTM basis quite favorably. And as you also know and you hit on this, we've shifted a number of our distressed oriented resources to our dislocation opportunity strategy. And an 8-week period and in spring, we raised $2.8 billion fund we have north of $4 billion of capital committed to that strategy and already through the first several months of that fund strategy. We either deployed or committed a little bit north of 40% of that fund already. And so, it's a big opportunity, we think for us and that's why we've diverted some of the team to be focused on those activities.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, just - add on a couple of thoughts, Glenn. So first, we feel good about the underlying portfolio, we think a bunch of those marks are going to come back. Secondly, when you look at the page in the deck that shows kind of the LTM period, it's important to keep in mind that the convention in terms of how that page is put together means that what's dragging that number down is our Special Sits II fund, which is all of $2.1 billion of fair value and its $73 billion credit business. So our perspective is - a lot of that is going to come back over time and it's a very small part of the overall business and credit as a whole continues to perform. I think perhaps to your market opportunity question. We do think that there is going to continue to be an interesting opportunity, but what it's going to require is to be really nimble and kind of flexible as to how you deploy capital and that's why to your point we raised a dislocation vehicle, incentive vehicles. They have the ability to invest across asset classes. So we're investing not only in traditional distressed, but traded markets, real estate credit, corporate credit you got to be able to move quickly and actually some of the early investments we made there. We've already monetized. So I think you should expect us to continue to scale that dislocation platform over time. But that's how we're thinking about it. Its first control for just - control distress, then it is just being able to move quickly.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein: Great thanks, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about deployment dynamics and the implications that might have on both the fundraising and the capital markets business. So from what we could see, you guys have been quite active and the pipeline of deployment, just I guess and some of the public data looks really strong coming up? So I guess what does it mean for sort of timing of North America up 13, the next infra fund or the next European fund in terms of both kind of fundraising and when those fees could ultimately come online. And then I guess secondly, the outlook for the transaction revenues albeit I guess kind of lumpy and hard to predict, but just from a trajectory perspective, given the strong deployment pipeline, how should we think about that over the next 12 months? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Alex, it's Craig, why don't I give a beginning part answer there as it relates to deployment, and then as well as fundraising and then Scott and Rob may want to add on. I think you're right as it relates to deployment it's been a really busy period for us as you heard from Rob, private markets in particular in the third quarter was a really healthy figure for us. I think that reflects a number of things. One, the overall growing platforms for us certainly also reflects the decisions that we had to lean into dislocation earlier in the year. As Rob had mentioned, the activity that closed in Q3, largely reflects transactions that were announced in the spring. And I think the third thing you see, reflects the geographic breadth that we have in our presence in Asia. Asia within private equity was a business busiest geography for us deployment wise in PE in the quarter as well as year-to-date. And as you'll remember, we do run a very localized model in Asia. So I think as it - that approach is very helpful for us, as it relates to sourcing and executing opportunities. I do think as it relates to fundraising the main dynamic is that things are on track. So as, it relates to the three additional flagship funds for us in addition to the fundraising continued for our Asia private equity strategy. And then when you layer on the 20 plus additional strategies. As we look forward, I think everything is on pace for us. And important in that is only 25% of those strategies that we see coming to market our first time for us. So I think, we have predecessors that are performing and real benefits as it relates to maturation. I do think as it relates to that overall deployment dynamic. One of the things that is correct that as it relates to accelerated deployment finding attractive risk reward, if anything that can move the overall timing as we try and think things more forward. But the overall message is one that we're on pace.
Robert Lewin: Alex, it's Rob maybe a couple of points to add on. In terms of the geographic breadth of our deployment, as we've looked at where we're likely to wind up in the year from a private equity perspective, it's actually close to a third, a third, a third, Americas, Europe and Asia in terms of deployment. And so that's really that geographic breadth and diversification has really helped us be able to lean into different opportunities on a global basis. Then, as it relates to the second part of your question, in terms of the impact this can have on transaction fees. Our pipeline remains healthy for investment, the remainder of the year of course, we got a couple months left in 2020. And some of the deals in our pipeline might slip to Q1. So it's a little bit hard to predict our transaction fees for the quarter, but certainly our deployment levels have helped those figures on a year-to-date basis. And if our deployment continues to be robust over the coming quarters, then you should see a similar level of transaction fees play out.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.
Jeremy Campbell: Just quick point of clarification before I ask the question, relative to the $200 million plus fee revenue opportunity from Global Atlantic you guys highlighted back in the summertime. Just curious if these recent block deals were baked into that or incremental to that?
Robert Lewin: The short answer Jeremy is they're incremental to that.
Jeremy Campbell: And then, I guess bigger picture on Global Atlantic. Can you remind us what the typical organic growth looks like? I think the summer slide deck is something like $9 billion, and then maybe how you envision the growth algorithm going forward between organic flow and inorganic blocks?
Scott Nuttall: Yes sure Jeremy, it’s Scott, I'll take that. So, I think the way to think about it is Global Atlantic, in our view, is just multiple ways to grow. So there is the retail business where they have relationships with over 200 banks and broker dealers. There is the institutional business and it's really although it could be thought of as organic or in organic I suppose. There is a lot of aspects of that that are fairly recurring and somewhat predictable. For example, they have flow reinsurance arrangements with a number of counterparties. There in the pension risk transfer business. And then on top of that, you've got these reinsurance blocks that you referenced, that although they are transaction like, there is actually been a very steady stream and that’s a very consistent flow for the business over the last several years. So there is opportunities to grow from what they've done - group that together, and we call the institutional business. And then third, there is potential acquisitions of other companies, which is truly the inorganic. As you can see from the slide deck from July, the company has by virtue of really that retail and institutional approach grown quite significantly and a very steady pace over time. I think with the addition of, hopefully, our help in terms of access to capital and investment returns. Our expectation is that we can continue to see attractive growth. We're not going to put out a forecast per se, but we're happy to share with you what we're seeing over time. And as you've noted, we do expect to be larger at closing than we had expected, partially because the organic growth frankly has been better than we thought on the retail channel so far. And the blocks are on top of that, but we'll keep you updated along the way.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: You mentioned the Epicor sale which looks fairly punchy. So could you just give us an update on kind of the announced pipeline of carry and investment income as it sits right now?
Robert Lewin: Yes sure, hi Patrick it's Rob. And just to clarify, that was - that Craig mentioned was a dividend for Epicor in Q3, the announced sale closing in Q4, which I could lead in to your question. So as it relates to Q4 revenue, as of now we have more than $250 million of performance and balance sheet revenue that we've got line of sight on. And so this is from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and we expect to close as well as from booked incentive fee that have already been crystallized. And so, we're only one month into the quarter. And hopefully, we'll have some things break in our direction, November and December to elevate that number, but our line of sales by 250, a little bit north of 250 right now, which is similar to where we were at this point last quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.
Michael Carrier: Thanks for taking the question. Just given the strength given in private equity, on the performance side just wanted to get maybe some color on what you're seeing maybe across some of the different industries regions, because it was obviously pretty broad based. But when we look at obviously the economic activity, it's pretty kind of start difference. So just any color in terms of what the drivers and - is this broad based as it looks? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Mike it’s Craig. Why don't I start and Scott may add in. I think the answers are really situation specific so, businesses that are in troubled sectors or have seen real impacts from COVID. Obviously, you see that, I think on the flip side, we have seen real strength in companies focused in areas that have been given tailwinds from COVID. So that's ecommerce, gaming, mobile gaming, software, housing related themes, health and wellness and the like. And I think given the conviction that we've had around several of those themes, we were better positions as a result of that. And so that's really what you see across the performance statistics for the year. And I think it is worth, mentioning Asia again as part of that, as we've a large business in Asia in our geographic focus again it's helped. It helped us learn in the spring, as these economies recovered first. And currently, it should help as most Asian economies haven't seen the recent spike in COVID trends that we've seen across several states in the U.S. and European countries.
Scott Nuttall: Yes Mike, the only thing I'd add, just put some numbers around that. So just to give you a sense - it really is about portfolio construction. And the fact that we've been focused to Craig's point on a number of investment themes for the last several years that we think have long-term durability. And that actually the pandemic has probably accelerated the development of those themes. So big part of the answer to your question, why you're seeing the performance is we've been meaningfully underweight. The sector has most dramatically impacted. So if you aggregate, hotels and leisure, retail and energy, it's a sum total of about 8% of our total exposure, even within real estate. It's a very small piece in the hotel side. So we've had very little exposure to the most impacted sectors. And we all can tell from the markets, it's a really bifurcated story. Where we have been more exposed – has been tech media telecom to Craig's point that's been 25%. So where we've had our exposure, and then Asia has been, about a third of our total PE portfolio 30% or so. So the answer really is around portfolio construction, and leading into these themes that we think are just being accelerated.
Operator: Our next question is from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.
Gerry O'Hara: My question is sort of runs balance sheet and the allocations there so clearly that the allocation is certainly kind of changed with the addition of global pandemic. I think in the past, you talked about kind of diversifying the exposure across asset classes. But perhaps you can give us an update on how you're thinking about that post insurance assets coming into the mix or if that's even really a focus right now?
Robert Lewin: Gerry, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. And so Global [indiscernible] are the largest single investment in our balance sheet, it's not going to show up in our investment table, per se since it's really going to be a consolidated operating asset of KKR’s like our other operating businesses. In terms of diversification of our balance sheet holdings you look at the chart in our earnings release. And while it does show about 70% exposure, private equity, inside of that, we've got meaningful exposure to core private equity it’s about 20% of our portfolio a little bit north of that today – on a growing exposure, growth equity. And so, we do certainly want to have a greater exposure to these types of assets on our balance sheet, and I wouldn't expect, dramatic changes from here around how we've allocated our balance sheet to-date.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Christoph Kotowski: Yes, good morning thank you. I know these numbers bounce around quite a bit. But normally, your realized carry is like four or five times the level of realized balance sheet gains. And this quarter, they were almost equal. And I'm just wondering, is that – did that I was trying to figure out where that came from and why that is? And should we expect to see a kind of shift towards more realizations in the coming quarters?
Robert Lewin: Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. No, I don't think that's a fundamental shift. I think that's just looking one quarter time, we had meaningful balance sheet realization through – our stake in the Hut Group, and while that was invested across our broader platform, it was certainly weighted towards our balance sheet. And so, I would not expect this to be necessarily a trend on a go forward basis. At least in the near term as our balance sheet continues the evolution into one that is going to be compounding in nature at some point in time in the future. As we've completed, I would say that evolution of moving from a balance sheet that is generating cash to one that is compounding over time, that compounded balance sheet will mature to the point where it's generating meaningfully more cash. But that's sort of in the next stage of our growth profile here for the foreseeable future. I think the expectation would continue to be carried – be it elevated gains to balance sheet income.
Christoph Kotowski: Okay, great.
Scott Nuttall: That’s a segment I would add it's always felt to me like we have multiple ways to win and this was a quarter where I think you're right investment income and balance sheet performance contributed to DE while we still saw significant book value compounding. And capital markets in addition had a very strong quarter so it's always – we've talked about how we think the business model is really wonderfully resilient. And I think – this quarter those items were both great examples.
Christoph Kotowski: Yes and then I was also curious, if you can discuss it. Just why the odd kind of like two part exit from Epicor are with first the dividend recap and then a sale process, is that tax driven or if you are going to sell something, why would one to do a dividend recap immediately in front of that?
Robert Lewin: Chris and it was not tax driven and without commenting too much any specific situation, we were able to get something done that drove liquidity back to the firm with a capital structure that was portable for a new buyer. And it just so happened that we were able to exit it a couple months later on so there is nothing that was specifically unusual, about that transaction.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris: So with the news out there that Aries is bidding for A&P. I was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts on how you guys are thinking about M&A at this point. Are you open to deals, are you looking at deals or is the main focus right now primarily Global Atlantic?
Scott Nuttall: Chris it’s Scott, thanks for the question. We do have a lot of work to do on the Global Atlantic front, but the answer to your question as we continue to look for new opportunities. You know the bar remains very high, but we were continued to focus on some of the areas we talked about in the past, growth areas for us, like real estate, some of the other kind of adjacent parts of the space around well as secondary's or co-invest. And then over time, you should continue to expect us to be thinking about through and with Global Atlantic whether this more things to do in insurance. So we're continuing to look, and we'll keep you posted, but we're definitely still out there.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.
Robert Lee: I'm just curious - actually I questioned Marshall Wace. I know there is a slide in your Investor Deck from September that shows pretty phenomenal growth. Can you maybe just update us on maybe what its contribution was this quarter, and is there still kind of how you're working with them. And then maybe there's still an opportunity for you to increase your stake in Marshall Wace?
Robert Lewin: Rob, I'll take the first part of that, and I think Scott going to take how we're working together. So our punch line is, the business is performing very well north of $45 billion of AUM today. We have a 40% share in that. And you're seeing that flow through our financial results in a couple of ways. Through most of the year, you're seeing it flow through on our pro rata share of management fees. What you'll see and a little bit of incentive fees along the way, their performance year end is the end of September. And so what you'll see in our financials in Q4 is an elevated level of incentive fees, which is our pro rata share of Marshall Wace incentive fees. And that was in the 250 plus million number that I gave earlier on this call around our pipeline of visibility.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I would add Rob, is and thanks for the comment. I think, the Marshall Wace management team has done a fantastic job growing the business navigating this environment and continuing to grow the firm. We have continued to work together on a number of different fronts. But it's just been a great partnership and it's been satisfying in terms of the discussions we have about markets and continue to explore ways to do more strategically together. But, it's also been a partnership through which, it's had a very nice economic return for the investment that we've made off the balance sheet. In terms of the question about raising the stake, the initial phase of the transaction was for us to invest 24.9% that as scheduled went up to where we are now, which is about 40%. There's no near term plan to change that, that may always change over time.
Robert Lee: And then maybe just a follow-up question. I guess you can have a conference call that ESG coming up I guess. But, and thinking about you had the announcement today about in India, the [indiscernible] platform you had your impact on. But just more broadly, how do you think of, the firm's positioning to whether it's - or how are you incorporating some of the principles within kind of within your strategies? And on the private investment side, private equity side, you feel like - it’s more important or similar to what you're seeing on the public investment side in terms of LPs really focusing on those capabilities and how you're incorporating into your process?
Craig Larson: Bob, its Craig Larson, I think there are two things to understand first, we as a firm have been focused on ESG since 2008. So at this point, we have over a decade of experience in driving and protecting value through ESG management. And we believe we've established ourselves as a clear leader in these areas. And what it means at this point is within our firm like ESG considerations are integrated within the decision making that's taking place every day within our deal teams and our investment committees on a global basis. So these are one off items, one off projects is part of the mindset of our teams as we evaluate opportunities, and look to execute and create value. And I think the second point is really, as a result of all of this work. We were finding good investment opportunities through the work that everyone was doing but there were cases when we didn't have a home for these investments. So you're right, we've created a business around this. That's our impact business. That's a strategy that's focused on opportunities to generate private equity like returns while driving positive impact at the same time. That's the opportunity. Though, earlier this year, we held our final close, I think it was February on our impact funds. And we're off to a very good start. And I think as it relates to trends and dynamics from a public shareholder standpoint, from an LP standpoint, et cetera. All these considerations and dynamics are only increasing I think in importance and increasing in terms of focus from third party constituents, consistent with what I expect you're hearing from others.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: I wanted to follow-up on the strong investment returns that you guys posted today and touched on earlier. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit more on your views on the investment return outlook on both the existing investments there that are in the ground, and also the new capital that you're putting to work today. In terms of what sort of returns are you expecting to generate across the different types of strategies that you're managing? And how is the attribution of those returns evolving?
Scott Nuttall: Mike, it’s Scott. Thanks for question. Look, I think the short answer to the first part of the question is that we continue to see a lot of upside in the portfolio. And as you can tell from the amount of deployment we've had this year $42 billion in total terms of closed and announced transactions, we've been deploying more capital into those investment themes that we think have a lot of legs. So the opportunity to continue to generate attractive returns from here we think is very attractive. We believe that it's, you know, going to continue to be driven by having the exposures to the parts of the economy globally, where we see those long-term trends playing out. And we think our globality is going to help. The fact to Rob's point that the deployments and about a third, a third, a third, U.S., Europe, Asia we think also will help the returns to a go forward basis. And most investors, I think look at us and how we're performing relative to the public markets, when they look at our private markets returns. And that's, I think our expectation is, we can continue to outperform nicely, and hopefully meet and beat their hurdles. And in terms of the go forward opportunity, we continue to stay focused on a number of those themes, and continue to involve them all the time. And it kind of the meta level, there's the investment themes. But the other thing we probably should talk about more on these calls is our growing real assets businesses, where we are seeing real opportunities to invest in real assets with yield. And that's part of the reason you're seeing such growth in our infrastructure, and real estate businesses in particular.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: Thanks for the follow-up. I have a quick follow-up on the tax question. I think, obviously, public shareholders the changes - towards the change in the corporate rate that impacts us, but as you think about a potential change in the capital gains tax rate, would that cause any kind of rethink of how the balance sheet growth strategy works for you kind of internally or not?
Scott Nuttall: No change in how we would - short answer no change and how we would evaluate opportunities in our balance sheet strategy.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question for Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Mike Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the balance sheet, if you guys gave are able to share with us the amount of capital that was deployed off the balance sheet in the quarter and also how much was monetized from the balance sheet? Thanks.
Robert Lewin: Yes, sure. No problem. In the quarter, we deployed a little bit more than $800 million of capital to balance sheet and we realized about $360 million.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Just would like to thank everybody for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, we look forward to following up with you directly, please reach out directly. And thank you once again. Bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investors Center section at kkr.com.  This call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. And we hope that you and your families, of course, are safe and healthy.  To begin, as a reminder, in early July, KKR signed a definitive agreement to acquire Global Atlantic Financial Group, or GA. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions and isn't expected to close until early 2021. So while Scott is going to touch on GA in a few minutes, the quarterly results we're going to discuss on this call exclude the results of Global Atlantic. The presentation and transcript from our investor call that introduces GA and all of the opportunities that we see resulting from the acquisition are both available on the Investors Center section of our website. Also of note in the quarter before I turn to the supplement. On June 26, we were pleased to be added to the Russell Index family, including the benchmark Russell 1000 and 3000 indices. This is just the most recent step in the evolution of our structure and our shareholder base. Since we announced our conversion from a partnership to a traditional corporation in May 2018, we've seen a meaningful increase in our mutual fund and index ownership, and our stock is up over 70% on a total return basis over this time frame compared to negative 7% for the S&P 500 Financials Index. Alongside our fundamental performance, the changes we've made to our structure and reporting have played an important part in this, and we continue to meet with new potential investors who haven't evaluated our sector or KKR before.  Let's turn to Page 2 of the supplement to go over our key metrics. Looking at the top half of the page, you can see AUM this quarter grew to $222 billion. With global equity indices up modestly over the last 12 months and high-yield and leveraged loan indices down over this period, our AUM has increased 8% year-over-year. Alongside investment performance in Q2, we had a strong fundraising quarter with $16 billion of new capital raised. Driven by fundraising and capital deployed, management fees over the last 12 months were $1.3 billion, up 13%.  Looking at the bottom half of the page. Our book value per share this quarter came in at $17.73 per share. This is up 7% from the $16.52 we reported last quarter. And as you can see, even amid significant volatility over the last 12 months, our book values remain relatively steady compared to the $17.81 per share reported a year ago. And finally, our after-tax distributable earnings came in at $326 million for the quarter or $0.39 on an adjusted per share basis, flat from Q2 last year. That brings us to $0.80 per share for the first half of the year, up 5% compared to the first half of 2019 and over $1.4 billion of after-tax DE over the last 12 months.  And one additional point when you look at the bottom right-hand chart. The top part of the bars, the lighter shaded portion, reflects realized balance sheet gains which can be more episodic in nature as we're also going to look to compound value on the balance sheet. So where we've seen more consistent growth is reflected in the bottom, darker portion of the bars, our fees and carry, in addition to interest income and dividends.  Turning to our summary financial results, please look at Page 3 of the supplement. Focusing on our results for the second quarter 2020. Management fees were $333 million, up 10% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our realized performance income totaled $355 million. Despite all of the volatility, it was a good realized carried interest quarter for us, with carry generated across the firm. Over 90% of the carry came from investments outside the U.S., with over half coming from non-private equity strategies. The largest exits in the quarter were accomplished at a blended multiple of approximately 3.5x our cost. With $90 million of realized investment income, our total revenues were $892 million this quarter.  Now looking at our expenses. Compensation, including equity based comp, totaled $357 million, with our comp ratio once again this quarter coming in at 40%. We noted last quarter that even with market volatility and an uncertain monetization backdrop, that we would maintain our expected comp ratio, low 40s as a percentage of total revenues, for the remainder of 2020. So this quarter is at the low end of that guidance. Non-compensation expense totaled $86 million in the quarter, which is down from the $99 million reported in the second quarter of 2019 due to prudent cost management.  All of these results lead us to an operating margin of 50% and after-tax distributable earnings of $326 million, which again translates to that $0.39 per share figure.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. I'm going to begin with some thoughts on our financial performance over the first half of 2020. And then we'll spend some time on our investment performance, before reviewing our fundraising and deployment activities.  To start, please take a look at the right-hand side of Page 3 of the deck. We've all clearly experienced significant market volatility year-to-date. Recognizing that dynamic, I think the resiliency of our business model is best highlighted by our results in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. One of the key financial metrics that we utilize as a management team and we know is a critical focus for our investors is after tax distributable earnings per share. We were flat in Q2, and for the first half of 2020, our after-tax DE per share is up 5% relative to the same period last year. To be up 5% in such an important profitability metric does represent, we believe, differentiated performance relative to a broad set of comparables and speaks to the resilience of our model.  I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on this call walking through some of the drivers of our performance. Let's start with revenues, which totaled $1.8 billion for the first half of the year and are up 4% year-over-year. Our revenue contributions have really been broad-based. Our most stable form of revenue, management fees, are up 12% over the 6 -- first 6 months of the year. Our carried interest has also been a meaningful contributor this year, as we have benefited from both strong investment performance and monetizations in several funds. Importantly, this is across different geographies and products, which has resulted in over $700 million of realized performance revenue year-to-date. That is up 25% relative to last year. And finally, our balance sheet continue to be a meaningful source of realized revenue, contributing $235 million in the first half of 2020. As it relates to our expense base, as Craig mentioned, last quarter on this same call, we committed to run KKR at a low 40% variable comp margin even through the volatility. Given our performance year-to-date, we are accruing total compensation, which includes equity-based comp, at a 40% margin, roughly flat to the same period last year.  Moving to our non-compensation related expense. Like many corporates, we have benefited from the reduced operating spend of having most of our employees working remotely. In addition, our management team has been very focused on trying to reduce our cost footprint wherever we are able to do so responsibly and without jeopardizing future growth. While you can see this reduced operating costs on a year-to-date basis, it's most pronounced in Q2, where our operating expenses are down approximately 13%.  As a result of both our revenue and cost performance, our distributable operating margin has increased by approximately 100 basis points year-to-date and is tracking right around 50%. All of this results in after-tax DE per share of $0.80 for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to $0.77 for the same period in 2019.  So our revenues are up, our margins have improved, and most importantly, our distributable earnings per share are up 5%. In addition to some of the P&L metrics, fundraising has also meaningfully accelerated through the first half of the year. Our new capital raised is up almost 2x in 2020 relative to the same period in 2019. Looking at our results in full. Our model is proving that it can hold up quite well during periods of market uncertainty.  Turning to investment performance. Please take a look at Page 4 of the supplement. Generally, we tend to focus on the trailing 12 months. But on this page, you'll also see we have included performance figures for the quarter given how volatile markets have been. Our private equity flagship funds returned 14% over the trailing 12 months, that compares to the total return for the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices of 7% and 3%. Our flagship real estate and infrastructure strategies returned 13% and 30%, respectively, over the last 12 months. The sale of Deutsche Glasfaser closed in the quarter, which was a very meaningful monetization for our infra business and is a big driver of our LTM performance.  In credit, we had a very positive quarter. Leveraged credit, the largest of our credit businesses by AUM, was up 11% in Q2 and flat over the LTM period. Alternative credit was up 2% in the quarter and down 10% LTM. Alternative credit is a combination of our private performing credit strategies, which had good relative performance; and our distressed portfolio, which took some marks LTM. This all compares to the LSTA index over the 12 months, which declined by about 2%. In terms of our balance sheet, our investment portfolio appreciated 8% this quarter, driving the increase in our book value per share to $17.73. Of note, our net accrued carry balance increased 27% in the quarter.  Turning to fundraising. Please flip to Page 5 of the supplement. As mentioned earlier, we're finding this a good environment to raise capital. On this page, we show the quarterly capital raised over the past 5 years, where we have averaged around $7.3 billion per quarter. This compares to the $16-plus billion we raised in Q2, which is a record quarter for us as a public company in both private and public markets. In the bar on the far right, you could see how this $16 billion breaks down.  The largest component is the capital raised so far for our Asia private equity strategy, one of our flagship raises. Including capital from initial closings through July, our Asia IV Fund is currently at approximately $11 billion, which is already 20% larger than its previous vintage and the largest pan-Asian private equity fund in the world. We will provide further updates on the fundraise as it continues to progress.  The second component, $4.2 billion, encompasses first-time funds and adjacent strategies. As we have talked previously about increasing our management fees by at least 50% over the coming 3 years, flagship funds are definitely important, but scaling up these newer strategies are also critical to achieving that goal. We're now starting to see the impact as new capital is raised in areas like Asia infra, which now totals $2.5 billion, as well as Asia real estate, core plus real estate and our dislocation strategy.  And finally, in the quarter, we raised capital within leveraged credit, we issued 2 European CLOs and earned our pro rata portion of inflows at Marshall Wace, all of which show up in the additional component.  Turning to Page 6. I want to spend a few minutes on one aspect of our business that we believe is very differentiated. We've spoken frequently about the significant growth opportunities we have ahead had, maybe our biggest is in Asia. Over the past 15 years, we've created the leading private equity franchise in the region. In addition, for a number of years now, we've been hiring local talent and building integrated teams across many non-private equity strategies.  As a result, you're starting to see our asset management footprint across Asia really start to scale. We are the clear leader in private equity and we're benefiting from the direct expansion of some of our non-PE strategies, with capital raised in infrastructure and real estate, with more to come over time in areas like alternative credit and growth equity. As you can see on the page, over the past 12 months, AUM has increased from $19 billion to $30 billion, with a lot of running room still ahead of us.  Looking at the right-hand side of the page, you see the current run rate pro forma management fee impact of this new capital raise. With Asia IV now turning on in July, the net impact of this collective fundraising has added approximately $100 million of run rate management fees. Between the continued economic growth in Asia, secular tailwinds for the alternative space in the region, and our differentiated track record as well as best-in-class local team, we really believe our Asia business can be as big as our North America franchise in the coming years.  Finally, turning to deployment on Page 7. Last quarter, we talked about the global financial crisis and how it was formative for our firm and drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the post-crisis years. We wanted to better position ourselves to play offense during periods of dislocation. And we've done just that, having really been on our front foot from a deployment perspective.  As you can see on this page, we've invested or committed approximately $30 billion so far this year. This has been evenly split between public and private markets. Our public markets activity includes our traded credit as well as our alternative credit deployment. Mid-February through April was an exceptionally active period for this business when the market saw significant dislocation. Given our recent fundraising, we now have over $4 billion of AUM for our dislocation strategy. Approximately 30% of this capital has already been invested or committed.  Focusing on private markets, which includes closed as well as pending investment activity. Deployment has been across a wide range of strategies and geographies and is reasonably split between U.S., Europe and Asia. Our global infrastructure team has also been active, with approximately 10% of our investment activity coming from this asset class.  And with that, let me hand it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. And thank you, everyone, for not only joining the call today, but also for joining our call on the Global Atlantic acquisition in July. Before I start, let me first say that I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy, and that you're all doing well during these continuing strange times.  To pick up where Rob left off, perhaps the best example of us playing offense year-to-date is our recently announced acquisition of GA. This transaction is highly strategic for KKR. As a reminder, concurrent with the closing of the acquisition and pending regulatory approvals, we expect to become GA's investment manager. If you look at Slide 8 of the deck, you can see what this will do for some of our important metrics pro forma.  Taking a look at the top of the slide you could see AUM impact. As a result of the deal, our AUM increases over $70 billion, or 33%. And all of these assets will immediately hit our fee-paying AUM, resulting in a 45% increase in asset from $160 billion to approximately $233 billion. And the assets we manage on behalf of insurance companies will increase by more than 3.5x to over $100 billion. On the bottom half of the page, you'll see the transaction increases our perpetual capital by 4.9x, from $19 billion to $91 billion. And pro forma for the transaction, we will have 40% of our AUM either perpetual or with a multi-decade recycling provisions. And 84% of our capital overall will have a contractual life of over 8 years at inception. So the transaction will provide more scale and do it in a permanent way, meaningfully advancing several important strategic initiatives for us simultaneously.  But it's not just about the numbers and the immediate impact. This transaction brings us a fantastic management team as a partner that we believe is well positioned to grow GA materially from here. And the transaction provides us access to important underlying trends we have been looking to gain more exposure to and provide us an ability to grow faster overall as a firm.  Please turn to Slide 9. One of the critical strategic areas of focus for us has been what's happening in retirement and wealth trends globally. The retirement end market continues to grow with an aging population creating demographic tailwinds. And importantly, more retirement wealth is being managed by the individuals themselves. We have been looking to gain more access to these trends. Hence, our discussions with you over the last few years about our focus on areas like insurance, high net worth and retail.  GA sells annuities and life insurance largely to individuals in their 50s and 60s managing their own retirement wealth or managing it with the help of a bank, wealth adviser or broker-dealer. So GA gets us in the way of trends we have been looking for across both insurance and retail. And GA is well positioned to grow from here, both organically and inorganically. And as GA grows, KKR grows. So the transaction will have a large immediate impact on us, but we think the growth from here over time will be even more powerful.  Page 10 shows the financial impact of GA. Notably, we expect annual net management fees to increase by at least $200 million over the next couple of years as we ramp up our work together. And our current expectation is that this transaction will add north of $500 million of run rate annual after-tax distributable earnings by the end of our first year of ownership. That reflects incremental management fees as well as our share of GA's operating earnings. And overall, the transaction will be accretive to all our key financial metrics and increases their quality, stability and visibility.  Taking a step back, I want to take a minute to reflect on the year thus far. We have felt for some time that our business model provides us with a lot of ways to win and is more resilient than people understand. We also felt that it would take some volatility to really prove this out. Well, volatility has been the theme for some time now, and through it all, our model has proven to be quite resilient.  If you step back and think about it, year-to-date, we've grown our revenues and TDE, increased our margins, scaled our businesses organically, raising record amounts of capital, invested or committed over $30 billion and announced an important strategic acquisition using our balance sheet as a strategic weapon, giving us yet another way to win. And the last 7 months give us even more confidence in our ability to further increase our margins in the near term.  Putting it all together, we have increased the scale and earnings power of our firm and the stability and visibility of those earnings during this period, and we see more growth and opportunity ahead.  And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein: So the first question is around fundraising. Now that we've been in this more challenging environment for a couple of months now, what are some of the key lessons learned that we could extrapolate from with respect to KKR's ability to raise capital in this backdrop? And I guess how does this inform your prospects of management fee growth over the next 12 months?
Scott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Alex. It's Scott. I'll take that. Look, I think we have learned a lot during this period of time. As I think we mentioned a bit last quarter, we've really picked up our dialogue with our investors and prospects during this period. So a lot of discussions, a lot of outreach. Easily 2x or 3x what would be typical in the pre-COVID environment. And a lot of that's been comparing notes on what we're seeing, talking about what we're doing in terms of playing offense, a little bit on what we're doing to play defense.  And so I think one of the big lessons for us is that communication and that transparency has really, we think, been beneficial to enhancing those relationships. And we're seeing it come through in the numbers. And Rob took you through some of the fundraising stats. But it's really coming through, it's institutions, it's high net worth, it's retail, it's insurance, it's really broad-based. And so I think, overall, a big lesson for us is keep going with communication and transparency.  And the other thing I think we're finding in this period of time is that brand is powerful and having a global presence is very meaningful. And so we've also found that having incumbency and brand, you can have an advantage during a period of time like this. So those are a couple of things we've taken away.  And I think in terms of what it means for the growth, Rob had mentioned that we had shared a couple of quarters ago that we felt good that we could grow our management fees 50-plus-percent organically over the next 3-plus years. That's before the Global Atlantic acquisition. And I'd say -- well, it's hard to be precise. I'd say this period of time gives us even more confidence in that path.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr: So you've made some hires on the retail front lately, and you're clearly seeing some progress as displayed in a couple of the fund raises that you just mentioned. I'm just curious where you think you're at in the retail buildout and which products might be better suited there. Meaning, do you have everything you need? Or are you still on that innovation and rollout front?
Scott Nuttall: Glenn, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. You're right. We have been hiring into that team and continuing to build up that effort. We're by no means done. I think there's more to do on the hiring front. We have been continuing to gain traction in the retail space, in the high net worth. We've got a direct team. We have a platforms team. We have a number of partnerships that we've developed around the world. I think there's a lot more for us to do. So call it maybe second inning, bottom of the second, if you will. So we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunity, we think, ahead.  In terms of the products, it's pretty broad-based. So we've seen it across -- the retail channel be very effective in terms of raising capital for us across credit, certainly. But also across private equity, growth equity, infrastructure, it's been very broad based in terms of the different products that we found that the retail channel is receptive to. Particular interest as of late in anything with yield. And one of the themes we're focused on is real assets with yields. So I think you'll see even more in areas like that. So that would be real estate, infrastructure in particular. So a lot of different ways to grow there, we think.
Craig Larson: And I think, Glenn, it's Craig. The one stat I'd add on top of that as it relates to the quarter, retail, again, typically represents a teens percentage of new capital raised in any given quarter. And in terms of the $16 billion raise this quarter, again, it was a high-teens percentage. So it was again nice to see that follow through in terms of the results from this quarter as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.
Robert Lee: Great. I hope everyone's doing well. Scott, maybe just sticking with fundraising theme. Certainly, last quarter, understandably kind of a little more -- still positive, but more muted about maybe the timing and pace of fundraising, getting -- given everything, excuse me. You seem, in some ways, a little bit more enthusiastic about it now just in terms of maybe it's not going to be as delayed or as pushed out. Is that a fair assessment at this point?
Scott Nuttall: Rob, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well, too. Yes. I think last quarter, I would say, we -- you're right, we did share that 3-year kind of perspective in terms of our ability to grow our management fee line again by 50%. We mentioned last quarter that, at best we could tell at that moment, we might push that out a few quarters. We were more in the teeth of COVID at the time.  But I do think we do feel a bit more optimistic today. To be candid, it's hard to be entirely precise, given the dynamism of the environment. But I do feel like we're a bit more optimistic today with a quarter like the one we just had behind us and the deployment that we've seen across a number of our different strategies globally. So some of the fundraises that we expected might be kind of 24 to 36 months from now, some of those are looking like they could be more like 12 to 24 months from now. And so we're seeing some of those pulled in a bit.  So we're not going to get precise in terms of which quarter precisely. But you're right. I think we're a bit more optimistic today. And I'd say, overall, our confidence in being able to grow 50-plus-percent is higher, and to be -- than it was last quarter within that time frame just by virtue of what we're seeing.  I'd also say that, as a reminder, all of that is before the Global Atlantic acquisition. So if you think about what we've said today, we're expecting $200 million-plus of run rate management fees a year, a couple of years out, that's on top of that 50% growth, which would obviously bring us to something more like 60% or 70% growth if you combine the two.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.
William Katz: So just coming back to margins for a moment. Just want to just understand how much is just sort of tactical versus structural. You mentioned on one hand that you feel like you have opportunity to move the margins higher, so it sounds like that both in the scaling of the business as well as the transaction. But you've also alluded to sort of running at the low 40s for the comp ratio, and yet you're accruing at a 40% rate. So is the 40% rate the right baseline to be thinking about the legacy company? And will that improve subsequent to the GA transaction?
Robert Lewin: Great. Bill, it's Rob. Thanks a lot for the question. So let's start with GA. I think that's the easiest piece, and then we can build up. We expect the revenue that's associated with the transaction to flow through at a very high level. So let's take that in 2 buckets. The first is GA's distributable earnings. They're going to flow into KKR's distributable earnings. And just for clarity, we're not expecting any additional comp growth on those earnings.  And then while our expectation as GA's asset manager is that we'll need to add some additional resources, we do have most of our teams well built out, and so the incremental management fees and carry over time, we think, should flow through to our P&L at a very high level.  And then Scott mentioned earlier some of our more organic scaling that we think we have across the firm, and we think we should be able to drive real margin expansion there as well.  And so while we don't have any specific guidance on this call, I think there's a lot of things that point to a positive direction in terms of our margins over the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.
Michael Carrier: Rob, I didn't hear if you gave like an update on just kind of realization activity, or the pipeline. Sometimes, you guys do. And it's fair if you didn't, just given the environment. But any update on that front? And even from just the portfolio, like how are you guys feeling on sort of the realization of the performance, particularly on the private side of some of the companies? And not necessarily for the quarter, but just over the next 12, 18 months?
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks a lot, Mike, for the question. And that's a good one. As it relates to our Q3 revenue, we do have some forward-looking guidance there. We expect $250 million of carrying balance sheet gains that are from deals that are already closed or have been signed up and that we expect to close. And so we're only a month into the quarter and we've got a couple of months to go, so hopefully, we can take that $250 million number up a bit. But that's what we have locked in today from those 2 buckets for the remainder of Q3.
Scott Nuttall: And then, Mike, I'll pick up on the second part of the question. In terms of the portfolio, I think the first thing to understand is portfolio construction really matters especially at a time like this. And so our portfolio has been performing pretty well. And I think it's due to a few different things. One is we have just been underweight the hardest hit parts of the global economy. So direct energy is about 2% of our AUM; hotels and leisure, 2%; retail, about 3%. So if you aggregate all 3 of those, you get to about 7% of our AUM. So we've just been underweight those sectors.  On the flip side, we have our largest exposure in technology. And so 25% of our portfolio overall, give or take, is in TMT. And so our investments in data and e-commerce are doing particularly well, as an example. And then on top of that, we have a heavier weighting toward Asia, about 30% of our private equity portfolio, and Asia is kind of further along in the recovery.  So when you put all that together, we've actually been quite encouraged by the data we're seeing. We've seen a snapback in numbers since the last time we talked. Asia is coming back. Europe is coming back. And a number of different sectors in the U.S., we've seen the numbers bounce as well. But I think, overall, a lot of that's driven by how we've constructed the portfolios.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: It looks like you have some chunkier new investments in the pipeline in terms of putting money into work. So through that lens, do you have a view that, that could translate into a more constructive Capital Markets outlook than you've had in previous calls?
Robert Lewin: Yes. Patrick, it's Rob. It's a good question. The short answer is we do. And when we look at the first half of 2020, we've actually been quite pleased with the performance of our Capital Markets business, generating $130 million of revenue in what was a pretty challenging overall market, especially the leveraged finance markets, where we spend a lot of our time. But as we look at the second half of the year, our pipeline is a lot healthier. And our expectation is that we'll certainly improve on that first half number in the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Devin Ryan: I just want to follow-up on some of the retail opportunity commentary. And maybe just talk a little bit more about the connection with Global Atlantic footprint and their retail brokerage network. And I'm really just trying to get a little bit better sense on framing the opportunity in terms of how important it will be in accelerating the overall effort. Are there new products that will make sense to launch once that closes? And just whether leveraging this network is really an initial focus once the deal closes or more of a long-term kind of just ancillary benefit? Really just trying to get a framing of the opportunity and sizing.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Devin. Look, I think you've hit on a couple of important things. You're right. As a reminder for everybody, Global Atlantic has particular strength in their distribution through banks and broker-dealers, over 200 relationships of that type. And today, they're kind of distributing annuities and life insurance through those types of relationships. We do think there is a potential opportunity for us to work together with the GA team to distribute KKR products through that channel.  To be clear, that's an upside lever. It's not embedded in any of the numbers that we've shared with you today or in last month's call. But it is something that we've talked about from time to time as an opportunity for us to pursue together, either in just outright KKR product form, or to your point, creating new products together with Global Atlantic that kind of marries their capabilities in terms of risk-taking and investment management, frankly, because they have a very talented team on the investment side in their own right, with our capabilities around investment management as well.  So we have talked about creating new products together for those channels and using their distribution to distribute them. So again, neither of those opportunities, whether it's KKR product or new products we can create together, are in any of these numbers. But it is something that we thought about as an upside lever over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.
Gerald O'Hara: Great. As it looks -- you noted in the deck that the GA deal takes perpetual capital up to, I think, roughly 40% of total AUM. Scott, perhaps you can give us some thoughts on sort of how you see that long-dated and perpetual capital as a percent of total ramping as you kind of grow the business moving forward, either through -- I guess, as you note, organic, inorganic insurance deals; or perhaps just other types of longer-dated capital that you might be looking to raise.
Scott Nuttall: Great. Thanks for the question, Gerry. So you're right. And just to clarify, so the bottom-right of Page 8 of the supplemental deck, what we're saying there is, kind of the perpetual capital technically is 31% of our AUM pro forma. And then the way you get from the 31% to the 40% that you referenced is we're also including our strategic investor partnerships. And those are the relationships that we have with big institutions around the world, where we are recycling capital plus a percentage of profits for an extended period of time. And so most of those have a total life of somewhere between 20 and 30 years. So that -- it's the sum of the 2 that gets you to the 40%, and it's 31% and 9%.  And so to your question, to be clear, we think there's opportunities to continue to grow both. Just as a reminder, GA in its own right, without KKR as a partner, had about $17 billion of total assets in May of 2013; and is now, in terms of total GAAP assets, over $90 billion. So they've been able to grow organically themselves and inorganically without a partner like KKR. So we think that's going to be Part 1 of how we continue to grow our perpetual capital. It's just working with a great team at GA and figuring out how to continue and hopefully enhance that growth trajectory organically.  There are also going to be inorganic opportunities, we think, working with Global Atlantic, whether it be blocks, things we could do together in terms of just the flow they're seeing, which is significant right now; or additional acquisitions that we can make together that would expand the $72 billion or so of invested assets we would pick up upon closing. So there's the organic and the inorganic through GA, would be kind of the first part of the answer to your question.  And then the second part would be the strategic investor partnerships that we haven't talked about in a while, but we continue to find that we're getting good traction. And think of these as really, as I mentioned, multi-decade, but they're quite customized. They tend to be large scale, in the multiple billions of dollars each, and they compound by virtue of their terms. So we think there's opportunities to grow all of what I just talked about, on top of maybe thinking about other things that we can do organically for KKR in this space and inorganically. We have our BDC platform, we have our REIT platform, we have a number of different vehicles that we've been building away from GA and strategic partnerships that we can continue to scale. And we're looking to create new ones.  And so all a long way of saying that we expect that $91 billion of perpetual capital to continue to grow, and that 40% figure, we think, can continue to grow over time as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Just maybe, Scott, if we could just dive into Asia a little bit more, looking at Slide 5 and then to your points on scaling that business up, at that $30 billion level right now. Maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on the geographic distribution within Asia, which areas you're focused on and which areas you see geographically longer-term growth opportunities. And then you mentioned this could eventually become as big as the North American franchise. When you're saying that, say, over the next 2 or 3 years, what kind of AUM are you envisioning, I guess, for both?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Brian. I'll take a stab and maybe Rob can jump in with anything I missed. But in the first instance, you're right. We do have -- just to be clear, we have a pan-Asian approach. So just as a reminder, 8 of our offices at KKR are actually in Asia. So we have a presence throughout the region, and we have a very local model. So we have country teams, we do local sourcing. And we have those teams working initially across PE, but now as Rob mentioned, we've been expanding and bringing really the rest of KKR to Asia.  So when you look at that Slide 6 in the deck, what you see is you've got the growth of Asia private equity, but also these other bars starting to show up: Infrastructure, real estate, we're also working on private credit in Asia and growth tech in Asia as well. So we're bringing, if you will, the rest of the KKR product suite to that part of the world and leveraging this footprint that we've already built, and we're adding specific talent in each market as well to be able to execute on all this.  And I think what Rob's getting at is that we're just starting to see the benefits of that growth trajectory. And you can see how powerful it is on Slide 6, just with respect to what we've seen over the course of the last 12 months or so. And this is -- a lot of this is Asian infrastructure getting raised, Asia real estate starting to get raised. And you can see how powerful that is, just that, plus the next Asia Fund adds $100 million in management fees.  And so our focus is quite broad. It's North Asia, South Asia, developed Asia and emerging Asia. And we've been active in all markets and increasingly across real assets, private equity, growth equity, and now in credit as well. And so if retail, we're in the second inning, I'd say the expansion of Asia is probably a bit -- even earlier than that, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead.  We're not going to give you a forecast in terms of what that means for management fees. But suffice it to say, we've just added, we think, $100 million run rate with just what we've started to do, and this is just the beginning. So we do see a significant amount of growth opportunity ahead from here. And the investing that we're doing in Asia is consistent with a bunch of the investment themes that we've been focused on around the world. And so when you think about a lot of what we've done has been in some of the themes around digitization, telecom, cloud, there's a lot of what we're doing across the region in that whole tech space, in addition to a number of other areas around health care, wellness and a variety of other investment themes that we're excited about.
Robert Lewin: I think that's a really good summary, Scott. The only thing that I'd add on is we have a lot of tailwinds at our back in that part of the world. Clearly, if you're going to look out over the next decade-plus in terms of global growth, you bet on that part of the world continuing to grow at a higher level than when -- more western markets. We think alternatives as a percentage of the pie are going to continue to clearly grow in Asia really through all markets in Asia Pacific.  And then most importantly, we've got a best-in-class brand in the region and I think really unique access to bring on great local talent. And that's what we've been able to do, especially as we've built up private equity over the years and started to really scale our efforts in some non-private equity strategies, we've been able to bring in what we think is the best talent in the region to be able to do that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris: So we're seeing sales of annuity products across the industry drop pretty materially, and the culprit seems to be ultra low interest rates. Can you guys talk a bit about why you don't necessarily think this is going to be a meaningful headwind to the organic growth at Global Atlantic?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Chris. Look, I'd say we've seen the same as well. I think it's a little bit hard to separate, especially over the course of the last handful of months, how much of what we see in terms of decline in sales is low rates versus just a little bit of a dynamic of the pandemic. And perhaps it's been harder for some advisers to get to their clients or perhaps it hasn't been top of mind for some of the clients to focus on how they're managing their wealth as they get through this period. But time will tell.  But our view is that, if anything, this low rate environment is going to drive demand for savings products that have tax deferral. And really, that's what an annuity product is. And we believe by working with the Global Atlantic team and leveraging their distribution and our ability to invest well together, we can create a very competitive product in terms of what they've already done, but also then hopefully create some new products, as we talked about, that can really satisfy the appetite that people are going to have for yield and tax deferral in this environment.  So we don't -- we're not of the view that the last few months is a long-term trend. Our view is that it's a bit of a moment in time. And we believe that we'll continue to see organic growth by virtue of that need for yield. And I'd say on top of that, the inorganic opportunity is probably even more exciting by virtue of the fact that we're seeing a number of life companies and annuity companies that are looking to sell blocks of business and use proceeds to do things like share buybacks. And so we are particularly active with the GA team looking at their pipeline of new opportunities. But GA hasn't put out its numbers yet, so that's probably as much as we should say on the topic. But that's a little bit of background for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach to product and strategy-level profitability. How do you approach that and think about that? And given the number of strategies that you're likely to raise in the next couple of years, which strategies do you think will make the most progress in terms of improving their profitability? And which ones would you think would probably have to wait out a little bit further to maybe another fundraise down 3-plus, 5 years down the road?
Scott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. It's a really good one. We do have, as you know, a number of businesses that we've been kind of scaling over the course of the last decade. I think it's something like 18 of our 24 investing strategies are less than 10 years old. And I would say, if you'd asked that question 5 to 7 years ago, my answer would have been quite different than it is today. Because 5 to 7 years ago, we had a number of businesses that -- frankly, a majority of our businesses, that were kind of in that Fund I, Fund II, just starting to earn their way to run rate margins kind of level. But now as we sit here today, we have a majority of our activity actually getting into that inflection part of the curve, where we're starting to see real scale.  We talked a little bit about on Page 6 what that means is for an Asia IV PE Fund as an example. But if you think about what's going on across infrastructure with us, we're getting into -- closer to our third round of funds for some of our real estate strategies. So that -- those 2 areas, kind of that whole real assets area of the firm, I think we're going to really begin to see significant upside and opportunity in terms of scaling. And we'll share slides like Slide 6 with you over time as we continue to see that. But those would be a couple of areas that I would point to.  I do think we also have a variety of other areas, like our growth strategies which we don't talk about a lot. But health care growth, tech growth, and now Asia tech growth, as I mentioned. We're continuing to expand in the growth area and we're starting to get into Fund II and Fund III.  So the weight of the overall activity is now getting to that kind of Fund III, IV, V; whereas before, it was I, II, III. And so it's really -- that's a lot of what's behind our statement, both Rob's and mine, that we see opportunities for more margin expansion. And that's away from GA. It's because we're seeing the scaling of all these different types of strategies that we've started.  And we are creating new ones, like Impact. But relative to the quantum of capital that is getting to that scale/level, it's a relatively small percentage, whereas 5 years ago plus, it would have been a much bigger percentage. And it's really that shifting of the weight of the activity that gives us even more confidence in our ability to increase our margins.
Robert Lewin: Yes. Michael, it's Rob. Just to briefly add on. As we do our analysis, we go business by business. Even at that very micro level, there really isn't a lot in our business today where we're looking at things that need to scale in order to turn to profitability. And even some of our newer products that we are launching, that are on Fund Is, they are really leveraging a lot of the existing team and infrastructure that we have at KKR today. And so they're adding, effectively, additional scale and revenue to a cost base that's largely built out. So there's -- as Scott said, there's really not a lot there where we need to wait for that scaling to achieve profitability.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The best example, Michael, is probably core, which is a strategy where we manage $10-plus billion now. And it's really just leveraging deal flow and work that was already inside the firm. We literally did not hire a single person to raise that $10 billion. It was just monetizing what's already here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Christoph Kotowski: A couple of questions around Asia III and IV. One is just to confirm. You said that Asia IV turned on for fees in July. And the reason why I'm wondering is, I mean, you still have roughly like $4.2 billion or 47% of the committed capital left in Asia III. So I was wondering, like, has a lot of that been spoken for already? Or are you going to just have a lot of -- or are the two funds going to be investing concurrently?  And then, I guess given that you've raised Asia IV with almost half of Asia III still uncommitted, Americas XII is roughly at the same kind of level. So should we expect also kind of as quick a follow-on for the next Americas flagship fund?
Robert Lewin: Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that. And so it's a really good question. And the chart you're looking at in our press release, our capital deployed or our investment vehicle summary -- on Page 13, I'm sorry. That's based on deployed capital and not on committed capital. And so what you don't see flowing through there is deals where that capital is already spoken for and committed. And so we'll have a normal type reserve for our Asia III fund. But over the coming quarters, you'll see that deployed number for Asia III naturally kick out based on the transactions that have already been committed to. And you're right, Asia IV turned on in July. And so you'll see that flip from AUM into fee-paying AUM in our Q3 numbers.  And then as it relates to our Americas XII fund, you're right. The capital deployed in that fund has been strong. And I'm sure we'll have more news around potential raises for that strategy over the coming quarters.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Larson for any additional concluding comments.
Craig Larson: Jesse, thanks for your help. And everybody on the call, thank you, of course, for your continued support. Please follow-up with us directly if you have any questions further on the quarter. Otherwise, we'll speak to you in 90 days.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KKR Q1 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Operator. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. As usual, I'm joined this morning by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO; and by Rob Lewin, our CFO.  We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call.  Before we get into the results, we want to start by recognizing the extremely challenging times that we're all experiencing, and we hope that everyone on the call are safe and healthy. And our thoughts, of course, are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front line. As a firm, our priority during the pandemic has been the health and safety of our employees, while at the same time, continuing to provide best-in-class investment services.  Like many of you, we've largely been working remotely over the last several weeks. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technology and operations teams. It's felt like connectivity across the firm has actually increased. And similarly, the dialogue we've been having across our LP base has also increased as we've looked, if anything, to overcommunicate given volatility. And in terms of helping those in need during the pandemic, we established KKR's global relief fund, and we're also incredibly proud of all that our portfolio companies are doing in support of COVID-19.  Now turning to our results. We're going to begin on Page 2 of our supplement. AUM for the quarter came in at $207 billion compared to $218 billion as of 12/31 and $200 billion 1 year ago. New capital raised in Q1 totaled $7 billion, driven by fundraising in our real estate and Asia infrastructure strategies as well as within private equity. And driven by asset growth, management fees for the quarter as well as the trailing 12 months are up 14%.  We reported after tax distributable earnings of $355 million for the first quarter, or $0.42 on a per adjusted share basis. And looking on a trailing LTM basis, we generated after tax DE of approximately $1.4 billion. Book value per share, which is mark-to-market every quarter, came in at $16.52. As Rob will talk about in a few minutes, investment performance over the past 12 months has been nicely ahead of both equity and fixed income indices. So our book value is down only modestly over the trailing 12 months.  And finally, touching on a topic we introduced last quarter, inclusion in Russell's benchmark indices continues to be a priority for us. We've been meaningfully engaged with FTSE Russell over the last couple of months and any decision on something like index inclusion is obviously FTSE Russells' and not ours, we believe we meet Russell's requirements.  And with that, I'm pleased to turn things over to Rob.
Robert Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello, everyone. Really glad to be speaking with all of you today and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Beginning with the quarter's financial performance. We've reported solid results, especially when you consider how challenged the operating and monetization environment was from mid-February time. Looking at our distributable earnings P&L on Page 3 of the supplement and starting with our operating revenue. Total fees came in at $426 million for the quarter. Of those fees, approximately 75% are management fees, which are up 14% versus last year. Our management fees are largely driven by commitments to our funds, and the invested cost of our assets as opposed to the NAVs of our funds, which is a real financial benefit that our industry affords during periods of market dislocation.  Our realized performance income came in at just over $370 million for the quarter, driven by the sale of PURE Group and in South Korea, the sale of KCF Technologies. In total, carry generating exits in Q1 on a blended basis, were done at 3.5x our investment costs. And finally, realized investment income for the quarter totaled $145 million. In aggregate, our revenues grew by 11% this quarter compared to a year ago.  Moving to expenses. Compensation and benefits totaled $377 million, while noncompensation expenses totaled $94 million. One thing to note here. Our total compensation ratio, including equity based comp, came in at 40% for the quarter. As you think about your go-forward models, you should continue to expect our total compensation ratio to remain variable and in the low 40% range for the remainder of 2020. And finally, our operating margin came in at 50% for the quarter, with an increase in our after-tax distributable earnings per share of 11%.  Looking forward, we actually have reasonably good line of sight on future carried interest and total realized investment income from transactions that have closed since 3/31 and or have been signed and are expected to close. As of today, that number is in excess of $400 million. While a small number of those transactions still rely on various regulatory approvals to close, so there is some uncertainty around achieving 100% of that figure, it is definitely helpful to go into the next couple of quarters with a solid base of additional revenue. As a point of reference, a year ago on this call, that same number was a little over $200 million.  So in a quarter with tremendous volatility, all 3 forms of our revenue increased. Our margins were maintained. Our distributable earnings per share increased by 11% and our visibility into our near-term earnings has meaningfully improved relative to a year ago. However, this quarter clearly did bring its share of adverse impacts to our financial profile as well. You can see that most clearly in our book value per share, where all of our investments are mark-to-market every quarter as that came in at $16.52 at March 31.  Specific to our balance sheet, investment performance for the quarter was down 14% compared to down 20% for the S&P 500. And for the trailing 12 months, balance sheet investment performance was down 2% compared to down 7% for the S&P 500. While our book value per share decreased 14% since the end of December, it is still relatively close to flat from this time last year.  Turning more specifically to our broad investment performance for the quarter. Please go to Page 4 of the supplemental presentation. While you can see that many of the asset classes where we invest have been affected by the market downturn this quarter, our performance remains positive over the last 12 months. Our most recent flagship private equity funds were down 6% in the quarter, and our entire PE portfolio is down 12% compared to down 21% for the MSCI World index. Outperformance was driven both by our modest exposure to areas directly impacted by the pandemic. As an example, direct energy is less than 2% of the private equity portfolio. Alongside greater exposure to a number of technology and online oriented investments that performed quite well.  Turning to real assets. Our flagship real estate funds depreciated 1% over the quarter, while our infrastructure flagship fund appreciated by 18% in the quarter, which was driven by a significant exit that was at a valuation well in excess of its carrying value. While our energy returns are not shown in the supplement this quarter because we have an AUM threshold for what appears on this page, we know it's a front of mind topic right now. Our direct energy funds in aggregate were down 33% in the quarter. But as a reminder, this is only 1% of our total AUM.  On the public market side, alternative credit and leveraged credit depreciated by 16% and 13%, respectively. This compares to the LSTA and the high-yield bond indices that were both down around 13% in the quarter.  We do believe that the combination of our continued strong relative investment performance, especially in our flagship funds, as well as a 44-year history of operating through market cycles will hold us in good stead with our clients. While undoubtedly some investing clients have slowed down their pace of new commitments, we are also finding that there are others looking for ways to invest into the dislocation. As an example, in the 2-month window from March 1 through May 1, we have closed on or in legal documentation on over $10 billion of new commitments across our fund platform. In terms of what this all means for our fundraising outlook, it's a little too early to say. We've grown our management fees over the last 3 years by approximately 50%. And we've shared in the last couple of quarters that given the funds we have coming to the market that we felt we could do that again from 2019 through 2022. We are still confident in our trajectory, but our best judgment sitting here today is that the 3 year path can now take us a few additional quarters to achieve. So the destination is very much the same. It may just take us a little longer to get there. This is obviously a dynamic environment, so we'll keep you updated to the extent our views change.  Two final points before I hand it off to Scott. The first relates to liquidity. During the first quarter, we opportunistically raised $500 million of 30-year senior notes priced at 3.625%. We knew at the time what was valuable capital to raise, but it certainly feels quite differentiated in this environment. And in April, we thought it made sense to take advantage of an opening in the investment-grade markets for an additional $250 million of 3.75% senior notes that mature in 2029. Taken together, we have $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments in addition to our undrawn revolver capacity, providing significant liquidity and financial flexibility. The weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio today is over 15 years.  The second point relates to our share buyback activity. Since the last earnings call, we have retired 11 million shares at an average price of just over $23 per share. Looking at our buyback program since inception, in total review is over $1.3 billion to retire shares at a weighted average cost of just under $19 per share. We are confident that the shares we repurchased in Q1 will be a very good use of capital as we look forward over the next several years. As you would have seen in our press release, we have increased our share repurchase authorization back up to $500 million.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob. Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you're doing as well as can be expected during this strange time. The first thing I want to do is acknowledge how much the world has changed since our last call with you. It's pretty remarkable. I'm sure you're all working to process it just like we are. So I thought today, I would spend some time telling you how we are approaching the crisis as a firm and what we think it means for us.  Before I do that, let me go back to the global financial crisis because it was formative for our firms. At the time of the GFC, KKR was a smaller, more narrowly focused firm. We had a private equity franchise alongside a young U.S.-centric credit business. Our capital markets business was nascent, and we did not have a balance sheet. As we went through that crisis, we focused first on defense in our portfolio companies. We repositioned companies where we had to, and we were laser-focused on capital structures and debt maturity profiles. We were not forced sellers. And on balance, our teams did a very good job during that period.  We also made some good new investments, largely in PE, and we raised our first third-party capital in credit. During this time, we also took advantage of market dislocation and merged our then private asset management business into one of our public permanent capital vehicles, creating KKR as you think of it today.  However, we found during and immediately after the GFC, that our businesses and footprint were not relevant to many of the very interesting investment opportunities we were seeing. We became frustrated by that, and that frustration helped set us on the course to make sure that the next time there was a crisis or a meaningful investment opportunity, we would have the ability to invest more flexibly in any risk reward we found interesting. In short, we wanted to feel as good about our offense as we did about our defense.  So we spent the last 10 years since that crisis, building KKR based on that formative experience. Over that time, we've gone from a few hundred million of balance sheet assets to $20 billion, and we've dramatically increased our capital markets capabilities. We've also meaningfully expanded and diversified our business. Since the last crisis, we've gone from 2 investing businesses to 24, 10 offices to 21 and $45 billion of AUM to $207 billion. Because of all this, we now have the ability to invest in opportunities we like anywhere in the world.  So looking back, the last crisis was critical developmentally for us. We made some great investments, we made large and important moves for the firm strategically, and it was an inflection point that drove us to meaningfully expand our business in the years post crisis. We are viewing this crisis as providing similar opportunities, but off a larger base of capital, AUM and capabilities to work with. So the possibilities from here are greater, too.  So we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being ready as a firm this time to not only play defense, but also play more offense. And we've been doing a lot of both over the last several weeks. I thought I would share a bit of color on what we're doing on both fronts. But before I do that, let me remind you why our business model positions us well for periods of volatility. Our model provides a significant amount of stability and visibility. About 80% of our capital is committed for an average of 8 years or more. And we have $58 billion in dry powder, waiting to be called for new investments. When you have contractually committed capital that cannot be taken away and our liquid balance sheet, it is good news when asset prices get cheaper.  Also, our management fees are largely calculated on committed or invested capital and not influenced by marks. So our management fees are very steady. As an example, our fees actually grew year-over-year in both 2008 and 2009. Plus, we have a lot of committed capital on which we're not yet earning fees. $19 billion committed with a weighted average management fee rate of about 100 basis points that turns on when the capital is invested or enters its investment period. So we have nice stability of management fees and visibility on how they will grow.  We're also global. As you heard from Rob, the visibility of our near-term exit pipeline remains high. That is due in some part to our Asia portfolio, where, of course, the virus hit first, and where we've seen some economies reopen ahead of Europe and the U.S. As we've discussed, we also have a large and liquid balance sheet. During times like this, we can use our balance sheet to be aggressive for new investments, for strategic acquisitions and for buying our own stock. We view our balance sheet as a critical strategic tool, never more so than now.  Having said all that, there is no doubt this crisis is impacting our business. We've been playing a good amount of defense over the last several weeks, largely focused on protecting what we have.  Most of our people around the world are working from home. We're finding that it's actually going quite well. Hats off to our technology team. We're very well connected as a firm, and our teams are functioning at a high level. We're also focused on our portfolio companies. We were fortunate from a portfolio construction standpoint as we've been quite underweight direct energy, retail and hospitality. Those account for only 2%, 4% and 1% of our global investments, respectively.  Now to be clear, we definitely have a number of tough situations to manage, but it's a relatively small percentage of the total right now, and much smaller than it could have been with a different approach to portfolio construction. So the firm is operating well through this. And while we have a lot to manage, it is manageable.  And while defense is taking some of our time, we're spending at least as much time on offense. We've been using our business model in dry powder to invest into these markets. As I explained, we've been preparing for an environment like this for over a decade. More recently, as we've mentioned on prior calls, starting a couple of years ago, we repositioned our distressed and private equity teams to be closer together and created target lists or shopping lists for debt and equity that we would want to buy if and when dislocation occurred. This preparation has helped us. Since the crisis began, which we mark is when the market started to be more volatile on February 21, we've invested or committed approximately $8 billion of capital as a firm. This amount includes dollars invested by our leveraged credit teams in the traded loan and high yield markets. Of the $8 billion, approximately $5 billion has been in credit of some type and $3 billion has been in equity. We are using the target list we've been building over the last few years. And investing into companies we know and like at risk reward levels we find attractive.  We're also finding opportunities for our portfolio companies to pursue M&A. And to invest behind former portfolio companies, like we recently did with U.S. Foods, and we are looking at noncore subsidiary sales from companies looking to delever or buy back stock. So there's plenty to do on new investments.  We're also spending even more time than usual with our clients. Part of this is making sure they know what's happening with their portfolios. But a lot of it is discussing how to invest into these markets and ways we can work together. We're encouraged by those conversations, which have helped lead to 40 first time clients committing capital to us since the beginning of the year.  Hopefully, that gives you some color. We've been busy on both defense and offense, and the firm is incredibly well connected through this. There's no doubt the near-term path ahead is uncertain, but there are several critical areas where we have clarity. We expect to continue to be successful raising and deploying capital. We expect to continue to be able to generate returns well above what's available in the public markets. And we expect to be able to use this crisis as we did the last one to evolve and grow our business aggressively through and coming out of this and to create the next inflection point for our firm.  Thank you for joining our call. We're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. 
Alexander Blostein: So first, wanted to start with the outlook on fundraising. The path taking a little bit longer makes sense, given, obviously, lots of near term uncertainty. But I wonder if you guys can talk a little bit about how the composition of that fundraising pipeline may change relative to your original expectations. Which products could be smaller, which products could be larger, where you could continue to be pretty active versus the areas that could actually take a little bit longer?
Craig Larson: Alex, it's Craig. Why don't I begin with that, and I'll let Scott add on at the end. Just to give you a sense of where we're fundraising currently because it -- the breadth is something that I think you'll see in this. So in Asia, we're fundraising for our private equity strategy, also outside of private equity and real assets. In Europe, that includes fundraising for opportunistic real estate and direct lending. Also fundraising across our dislocation, Americas opportunistic real estate, real estate credit and core plus real estate strategies, and at the same time, that's going to continue areas that you're going to see on a more continuous basis, including our CLO business. We had issued a new CLO actually a few weeks ago as well as areas like our BDCs and the hedge fund partnerships. So I think it's a -- it continues to be a very active list of areas where we're fundraising. Scott, anything you'd add on top of that?
Scott Nuttall: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. A couple of things. One, I'd just overall say we remain very optimistic on the go-forward when it comes to fundraising. So in terms of your question about composition, no material change to the composition in terms of where we see ourselves accessing capital. Maybe just a little bit of color for you. There's just been a lot of dialogue and engagement with our clients, easily 2 to 3x the usual. And it's everything from comparing notes on the environment, explaining what we're seeing through our portfolio, especially in Asia, given our large Asia portfolio, where we started to see recovery ahead of the rest of the world. A lot of questions on that. We're talking to them about their portfolios. But basically, every conversation then pivots to offense and where to lean in.  I think we have a lot of clients around the world that invested into the recovery post GFC and are looking for ways to play offense. And we hit a couple of these in the prepared remarks, about 40 new LPs since year-end, $10 billion raised in the last 2 months. And in particular, we're seeing high net worth and retail lean in, in addition to institutional capital. So there's no change in expectation for our outcomes. The commentary around it may just take additional few quarters is our best guess. But as the markets continue to recover, we may shorten that over time, but it's highly path dependent, but no change in composition.
Alexander Blostein: Great. Of course. That makes sense. My follow-up question just around the $10 billion number that Rob and Scott, you both just mentioned. So $10 billion over the last 2 months. Can you give us what was in May? And then again, what kind of strategies drove that fundraising over the course of May? And give us maybe a sense on the sort of timing when that actually is going to come in into management fees?
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks, Alex. So what we were trying to do with the $10 billion, we'll not guide it quarter-to-quarter in terms of where our fundraising is, but instead to give a good sense to the investor community that we're still raising capital despite the volatility in the markets. And the best example we could give is the $10 billion of closed commitments or commitments that we have in legal documentation that we expect to close, as opposed to trying to parse it, whether that's going to be Q1 or Q2 or Q3 fee paying AUM or AUM.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup.
William Katz: Okay. I hope everyone is doing okay during this crisis, and thanks for the really well thought out prepared commentary. A couple of hot button topics that seem to be going through the alt space through this earning season is some of the composition of CLOs as well as potential clawback risk just given performance metrics in the quarter. I was wondering if you could address both maybe on the CLOs, how much of your revenues come from base management fees versus maybe subordinated or performance fees? And then how we should we thinking about any clawback risk, if at all, against the carry?
Robert Lewin: Bill, it's Rob. I'll handle both questions. On our CLOs, I'll just put it into context, we do about $17 million a quarter of management fees across our CLO complex. A little more than $10 million of the $17 million are subordinated management fees are more at risk. Across that $17 million, we see de minimis impact in Q2, where compliance today or at the end of 3/31 with all of our OC tests. Based on what we see today, with downgrades coming through our portfolio as well as where we are in the market, we could see some impact in Q3 and Q4. Right now, we don't think that, that's a material impact. But as that -- as things change over the course of the quarter, we'll make sure to update everybody on our Q2 call.  And then on the second part of that question, Bill was around clawbacks. Today, we've got roughly $90 million of clawback exposure through KKR. And that's a few small clawbacks in a number of different funds globally. It's not something that's an irregular part of our business. And what we shoot for is to have our accrued carry, certainly be north of any clawback liabilities in a material way, and that's really how we present our numbers. So the $1.26 billion of accrued carry that we have on our balance sheet is net of the $90 million of claw backed liabilities that we have spread across the firm in a bunch of different and smaller ways. But again, that's pretty normal course for us to have some form of clawback liability in our business. And as of now, it's relatively contained.
William Katz: Great. And if I could get in my follow-up, even though the first one was a 2 parter. Just Scott, you had mentioned using your capital for both investments as well as potential M&A. I just sort of wonder, was that a generic comment? Or is there an opportunity here to potentially pick up some distressed assets at the strategic level? And if so, excuse me, where might you be thinking?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Bill. As you know, we're always looking for opportunities, and we continue to look in this environment may provide some strategic opportunities that we find interesting. We're going to have a really high bar just like we always do. In terms of areas where we may be looking, I would point you to some of the younger areas for us, whether it's real assets, which is a place that we've been building businesses around the world as one potential opportunity. We're also thinking about opportunities on the distribution front. But nothing specific that I would point you to right now, just an observation that when you get in periods like this, sometimes opportunities come our way that we find especially interesting.
Craig Larson: And operator, if we could just ask everyone to please limit themselves actually to 1 question, that would just be really helpful as we look to work our way through the queue. And if you have a follow-up, feel free, of course, to then get back in and we can circle back around. We appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer.
Christoph Kotowski: Yes. Scott, I thought the color you gave on the investments that you're making, it was really interesting. Just a couple of things around that. One is when you said the $5 billion of credit investments, does that include investments made by your portfolio companies themselves to retire debt at a discount? And I'm curious, is there a lot of that kind of activity or was the window where they were distressed too short? And then secondly, you mentioned you did an investment in U.S. Foods. And I was curious, was that, since it's a publicly traded company, was that equity or debt? And I guess, why would you invest in a publicly traded company in a private equity portfolio?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Chris. First, on the $5 billion, no that does not include activity by our portfolio companies themselves in terms of buying their own debt at a discount. There was some of that activity but not extensive activity. So that $5 billion I mentioned was just for the firm's account specifically. In terms of the U.S. Foods investment, that was a convert. So it was a convert in a company we know well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Crédit Suisse.
Craig Siegenthaler: I wanted your updated thoughts on FRE stability in 2020 from current levels, just given your previous comments, to Bill's question on CLO subordinated fees and also some other sources of risk, including mark-to-market on NAV based funds, which I think is a small component for you guys, capital markets transaction fees, which are actually already quite low. And I'm forgetting if you include any FRE performance fees, including from like your BDC business Franklin Square, and FRA 2. So maybe just unpack other sources of risk that could maybe develop throughout the year. And of course, that would be offset by shadow AUM deployment and fundraising, too. But just I wanted to unpack those sources of risk there.
Robert Lewin: Great. Thanks, Craig. It's Rob. And maybe the best way to do this is to take our FRE in component parts. The first and most important are our management fees, as you know, which are roughly 75% of our total fees this quarter. Even with the potential impact of the CLO subordinate fees, it's a fairly minor part of our overall business. And as you said, our NAV based funds is also pretty minor. And so as we look at our management fee component, we think it's both stable and has significant growth in front of it. The best example of that is being up 14% year-over-year this quarter.  On top of that, we've also guided that we expect to grow our management fees by greater than 50% over the next 3 and change years. The other 25% of our fees today are made up of a combination of transaction and monitoring fees that I think, over time, are probably biased to go up based on the overall size of KKR and how it grows as well as our capital markets business, which we think is a long-term growth engine for us. And a normalized environment really should be able to take some additional share with the business model we set up and the people that we have.  And maybe the last component is the margin piece of it. What we've indicated in the past is that if we're able to achieve the management fee growth trajectory that we think we can do over the next few years, that we would expect to see some margin expansion flow through our business. And so while we haven't guided to a specific FRE number, we do think that when you break out all of the component parts that would suggest 2 things: one, a meaningful amount of stability; and two, some real upside from here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.
Devin Ryan: I guess just would love to maybe dig in a little bit more about kind of the investing playbook from here. I heard the comments about kind of moving the distressed team closer to the PE team. And just trying to think about whether you guys are going to be looking at maybe opportunities in areas that you've shied away from because valuations weren't interesting, but now we're getting to some maybe pretty severe distress, and so that could be more attractive? Or is it more kind of focusing on the same, I guess, maybe areas that you have been focused on but just potentially getting a little bit more attractive valuation. Just trying to think about what the stress kind of defined might look like to you guys and just kind of the investment playbook in that.
Scott Nuttall: Devin, thanks for the question. It's Scott. I would say, we're kind of seeing this rolling out in a few different waves, and there's probably 4 big themes as we kind of see how this unfolds from an investment opportunity standpoint. I'd say the first wave was investing in dislocated traded credit and equities, and that we were particularly busy on that front over the last couple of months. And the commentary we gave around the target lists that we had created were very helpful in that regard. So there were a number of companies that we were tracking both credit and equity, where, frankly, the prices were too high, but we had a target price. We've done the work, and we were able to buy on the back of that work when the dislocation first showed up. And some of those opportunities were very short lived, so we were able to move quickly by virtue of that. That was kind of wave one. We continue to see opportunities there. Spreads are still wide, and we continue to deploy capital into that opportunity set.  So the second wave we've seen is providing liquidity to companies that are in need. And those tend to take the form of either structured equity or credit, and we've got the firm working very well together across both PE credit, real estate infrastructure where appropriate, basically making sure that all hands are on deck. And when we have companies that we know and like, they are looking for liquidity, we can move quickly. And U.S. Foods is one example of that, but we have several other opportunities like that, that we're working on to the firm right now.  The third big theme would be around portfolio companies making acquisitions. We're starting to see opportunities of that type of merge now and are working with several of our portfolio companies that are looking to grow and be consolidators through this time. And there, again, probably a lot of those conversations have been going on for months or years, but there was a meeting of the minds on valuation opportunity in times like this is perhaps everybody becomes a little more economic around what can get done and the synergies are even more powerful relative to the base of earnings. And so we're busy there.  And then the fourth theme I would mention is around companies, both public and private that are looking to sell non-core subs. And they're doing that to delever or to buy back stock or in some cases, a little bit of both. And that wave is starting to show up. So what we've seen generally is it started in the traded markets and now has moved into more of the private markets. And so we're busy on all of those fronts as we sit here today. And that's part of the reason we're so enthusiastic about the deployment opportunity ahead of us and the return opportunity on the deployed capital.  And yes, to your question, some of those are in areas that we may have shied away from in the past because valuations were too high, and they started to come back our way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: Thanks for the industry exposure breakout detail there. A lot of the other firms have also been giving us more color around what percentage of the portfolio they view as particularly stressed or exposed to this recession. So if I believe you have 1 high profile, 1 that's been in the press that doesn't fit into the 3 buckets you gave. Could you maybe frame your view of the portfolio from that standpoint, the percent of exposed companies that you maybe have bucketed into a meaningful stress category? And then conversely, perhaps the percent that has been categoried as more okay or maybe even benefiting from this environment?
Robert Lewin: Sure. Thanks, Patrick. It's Rob, and I'll take that question. So we're not going to disclose how we break companies out into different buckets. But what we could tell you and it's what Scott mentioned on the call, and I'll expand on a little bit more, is we feel really good about our relative portfolio of construction, and it's going to be a combination of our limited exposure in energy, retail, travel, hospitality and leisure through our portfolio. On the upside, I think we've become overweight over the last number of years in online and e-commerce businesses, which have held up quite well over the last couple of months. And then the last point around portfolio construction for us is we obviously have a fair bit of weighting towards Asia as a firm. North of 30% of our private equity portfolio today is exposed to Asia or directly exposed to the Asian market, which has held up on a relative basis, better than the U.S. and Europe. And so overall, we feel good about our portfolio. Scott mentioned on the call, we certainly have our companies that are going to need some additional support through this period of time. But we think the overall construction of our portfolio and the health of our companies is part of the reason why you would have seen our investment performance hold up pretty good in our private equity businesses over the last quarter, and especially, if you look over the last 12 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.
Glenn Schorr: That's a good lead-in to the question. I want to talk a little bit more about the Asia franchise. I would ask both the short-term and the long term, short term, meaning, besides holding up better, what can you use in terms of those markets being ahead of us and opening up? And what can you learn from that across the franchise, where the opportunities are? And then longer term, is a little tougher because right now, there's a little more China related friction and nationalism everywhere in the world. And I just -- I don't know if that has any implications on your thought process about the Asia franchise because it's such an important part of who you are.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Glenn. It's Scott. So I'd say, first, on the short term, it's been hugely helpful having such a broad platform in Asia and such a big portfolio in Asia. Because obviously, we were able to see several of those countries and markets be impacted by the crisis ahead of Europe and the U.S., and we've started to see those -- a lot of those markets now bottom and start to see some improvement. And so just to give you a little bit of color, when the crisis started, we moved to kind of a daily call with the top people in the firm from all around the world, including in Asia. And the Asia team is sharing its insights from what they're seeing with our portfolio and on the ground, very early. And so we've been able to kind of learn from that as we adjust our approach in Europe and the U.S. and on the back of those learnings.  And we are seeing slow improvement across a number of our portfolio companies. We started to see it in Asia. Most manufacturing facilities are kind of now operating at 70% to 100% of capacity. We're starting to see that also occur in parts of Europe. And we're actually in some markets, even in the U.S., starting to see a bit of bottoming.  Now to be clear, it's not of the -- it's more like an elevator down escalator up type set of charts that we're seeing across the portfolio. But we started to see that happen in Asia over the last few weeks, and now it's showing up in the rest of the world. So it's been very helpful to us as we've navigated all this.  In terms of the longer term, we feel great about our Asia franchise and the opportunity we have in front of us. As a reminder, we have 8 of our 22 offices there, two of those are in China, 6 outside. We see a big opportunity to grow our business. As you know from prior discussions, we started in Asia in private equity and have now really been bringing the rest of KKR's businesses to Asia across real estate infrastructure credit, just to name some examples, growth technology, we're also bringing to Asia. And so we continue to see a big opportunity to expand our platform in that part of the world. And regardless of what happens with the China dialogue, we still feel quite good about the opportunity ahead for the firm.
Robert Lewin: Glenn, one additional point, I'll just -- it's worth mentioning when we're talking about our Asia franchise, that's relevant. We've talked a lot about Japan carve-outs over the last number of quarters and how that's been a real strategy for us there. We actually had our first exit of 1 of our carve-outs that we announced in March, the sale of alpha beta, and that closed in April, around 3x multiple of money for us, and you'll see that flow through our Q2 financials. But that was a nice win for that strategy for us in Japan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America.
Michael Carrier: I just have a question on performance fees and investment income. So your level of carry eligible AUM seemed to dip less in some firms. Your ratio of paying carries above 60%, I mean, likely hire post April rally. I mean you mentioned the $400 million pipeline. So curious on the outlook of performance fees, maybe a bit further out and realize tough to predict. But on one hand, it still seems like a fairly challenging backdrop, depending on the type of coverage but some of these stats make it look a bit better than period. So any additional color you can provide, including the stability of interest income and dividends from the balance sheet?
Robert Lewin: Sure. I'll cover both of those. Listen, there's a lot about the environment that's difficult to predict right now and carry -- realized carried interest, that would certainly be at the top of that list, I think, for all of us. But as you said, there's some encouraging statistics we have that 60% of our total carry eligible AUM. Today would be in carry paying mode on a liquidation value basis. And our accrued carry still stands at north of $1 billion. I think the most critical thing and what we try and do every quarter is to give you visibility in terms of what we actually do know on our carried interest and our realized balance sheet earnings, which is the $400 million plus million number that I mentioned in the prepared remarks.  As it relates to our interest and dividends, those have been elevated over much of the last three quarters for largely the same reason. We have a margin loan against our Pfizer shares and we've used that margin loan -- fairly low LTV margin loan to take a dividend in Q3, Q4 and Q1. And so that represented about 2/3 of our interest and dividends this quarter. And I think the other 1/3 of that is relatively stable, albeit with interest rates now near 0, we'll probably take a little bit of a hit on our cash balance on our interest line item. But the overall line should be reasonably stable going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.
Robert Lee: Great, and I hope everyone is doing well in this crazy environment. I have a question on the capital markets business. So I guess, thinking about it, it would make sense that at least in the near term, that business would slow, but by the same token to the extent maybe investment activity or opportunities kind of maybe pick up or remain healthy. There's actually some near-term opportunity for that business to be more resilient. So how should we think about kind of the capital markets business over the coming quarters?
Robert Lewin: So, it's Rob, and I'll take that question. Q1 was an interesting quarter for us, $60 million of revenue, sort of in line with the $50 million to $70 million of baseline revenue that we had suggested in our last call. About half of our business in Q1 was from third-party business. It's pretty meaningful, especially in a quarter where KKR didn't have a lot of deployment across our organization. Listen, we continue to feel that in capital markets environments that are stable, that we should be able in ordinary course to generate $50 million to $70 million a quarter and then have the upside potential from some large transactions that have been a regular occurrence as part of that business, which is exactly why we've averaged in that business over the last few years.  As it relates to the near term, I'm not sure we're yet in normalized capital market type environment. And so for Q2, we might be on the lower end of that $50 million to $70 million range, it's certainly too early to say, and there's a lot of the quarter left to go. But we do think that business in market opportunities when capital is scarce is where that business can really shine around some of the larger transactions that continue to come through our pipeline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Actually, a good follow-on right to Rob's question. In this environment, maybe you just got it Rob, if you can characterize the deployment capabilities in terms of anything getting delayed with the COVID-19 crisis and how that might sort of -- how you're thinking that might project out for the rest of the year, certainly if we get more contagion in the second wave? And then the -- how you see your -- both your capital markets business and your balance sheet, being used to help get deals done that a lot of other firms can't do to that extent?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Brian. It's Scott. I'll take that. In terms of deployment opportunities being delayed, I'd say there's probably a bit of a pause that went on, especially during the first several weeks of the crisis as people were trying to process what was happening. But we've actually started to see our pipelines pick up around the world. Some of it was in the areas that I mentioned in terms of some of the providing capital to companies in need of liquidity, the rescue type opportunities. But we are also seeing some larger scale private markets opportunities begin to reemerge. As an example, our pipeline in Asia is very active right now. So I don't think it's going to have a big impact over the long-term. It's all path dependent, obviously, but we are starting to see pipelines pick up on the back of some improvement maybe in the visibility in terms of timing. So we'll keep you posted on that, but no big long-term change. Just a few things may get bumped into the back half that might have been in the first half.  In terms of KCM in the balance sheet, it's a great question. We really view our model is providing us with a real advantage in times like this. And some of the deals that we've been able to get done during periods of dislocation have been because we have been able to use the balance sheet and our capital markets business to access financing, both equity and debt when others couldn't. So we've had several situations over time, including recently, where we're not necessarily the highest bidder, but we were the only bidder that could actually access the capital and have financing certainty. And so we, as in prior periods like this are viewing KCM and the balance sheet is providing us with a real strategic tool to be able to do that again. And so good question and we are focused on making sure that we've got liquidity on the balance sheet and the capital markets team is really well connected with our deal teams to make sure that we can do that well in a time like this.
Craig Larson: And Brian, it's Craig. Just one tangential point as it relates to capital markets in this value-add and certainly a strategic value is greater in periods like this. Sometimes people ask that question in the framework of our own portfolio companies. So one thing that I think it is helpful just to understand is how active the capital markets team has been to position us and allow us to be in a position of strength entering this volatility.  So when we look across the private equity portfolio in whole, we really have very few near-term maturities. So when we look at the maturities of our portfolio companies and what we see in 2020 and 2021, that represents only about 4% of the quantum of that long-term debt that we have. So I think we've -- given the strength of capital markets, it does help us allow us to be front footed when there is periods of volatility, I think it's also been very helpful in positioning us well as we entered this period.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris: Can you give us an update on where things stand with respect to the ownership of your stock by index and long-only investors? And related to that, what do you anticipate the potential Russell index might do to that number?
Craig Larson: Chris, it's Craig. So I think we've seen a nice increase as it relates to not only index buying in that index ownership, but also as it relates to mutual funds who do look at those benchmark indices as they make their investment decisions. And it's really been our experience there that has really influenced our decision as it relates to Russell. So in terms of the -- when we look at ETFs in that passive amount, that's been in the mid-60s, between 60 million and 70 million shares that have been owned by those index providers. And as it relates to Russell, first, there are those ETFs and strategies that are directly linked to those indices like the Russell 1000 and 3000 and I think that math is pretty straightforward. A lot of you have done that math. Again, I think it would suggest to teens, million in the teens as it relates to those more formulaic strategies.  And really the second piece that has really most interested us are those mutual funds that are benchmarked against those industries -- indices and our ability to market ourselves through to those institutions and increase our mind share. And as we looked at it, we think that second piece should even be more powerful than the first. And so recognizing that we've spent a fair amount of time, as you'd expect, looking at Russell, they publish a pretty detailed construction and methodology document. And within that, they review a whole series of considerations for public equity, domicile, market cap, float structure, a whole series of items. So of course, we've reviewed that document pretty closely and alongside of that, as we mentioned earlier, have meaningfully engaged directly with FTSE Russell over the last couple of months. So as we stated earlier, while any decision on index inclusion is obviously their decision and not ours, we believe we meet Russell's requirement.
Operator: Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask around LP demand. I certainly heard you on the $10 billion of new commitments coming in the door. But I just hope you could talk a little bit more around how you see LP demand for the private markets evolving in this backdrop. On one hand, you have the denominator effect that drives the allocations higher and lower distributions from the asset class for all these so that means LP have to fund the commitments in the allocations from elsewhere in their portfolio, which could be a challenge, but then you have low rates. And so maybe there's more demand. I just curious how you see these sort of pieces and LPs navigating through these dynamics and the impact it could have on the asset class? Do we see more secondary activity? And is that a part of the marketplace that you'd like to have more presence in?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Michael. It's Scott. I'll take those. It's a great question. And it is a bit early, honestly, to be able to give you a definitive answer on it. I think you're right. There's going to be a little -- there's going to be some puts and takes, right? There's going to be questions for some of the institutional investors around the denominator effect and what happens with the rest of their portfolio and their allocations to alternatives. But frankly, we've started to see the public markets rebound. And so I think what were initial questions about that, now there's a little bit of uncertainty as to whether the denominator effect will be a big consideration or not. I think we're just going to have to give that a bit of time to see how that settles out. The last time that happened, what we saw was not a big reduction in allocation to alternatives, but actually an increase in the allocation alternatives so that institutional investors could actually keep investing in the asset class. So we'll see what happens here, but it's pretty path dependent.  I think on the flip side of that, you're entirely right. I think even the conversation in the last handful of weeks with CIOs around the world, there is a real recognition that a low rate environment went to a virtually no rate environment, and they need to keep looking for ways to generate returns. And so the dialogue around alternatives continues, which is why those conversations, I think, pivot pretty quickly from defense to offense. And so we take that as encouraging. We think investors around the world are going to continue to look to the private markets for returns as they're expecting less and less out of their traditional fixed income and public equities portfolios. We think that's great for us.  And we're also finding just as an incremental piece of color, that during this period of time, there continues to be a lot of interest from the insurance space, which tends to be quite liquid and conservative in its approach, so we've been quite active in our dialogue with insurance companies over this period of time. And from the high net worth and retail markets, we're seeing them lean into this from an offense standpoint as well. So there's lots of tos and fros in all of that. But overall, we think it bodes well for our business. There's going to be an even greater need for return. And if you think about the power of the illiquidity premium that the alternative space provides, the lower the overall normal market return is, the greater that illiquidity premium is as a percentage of the total return. And so there's even more interest in what we do, we think, coming out of this.  In terms of your question on the secondary market, it's a space that we continue to spend time on and have looked at from time to time, I think there will be opportunities for the secondary space to continue to grow and that's one of the areas that we look to periodically as we think about other opportunities for us strategically, but nothing to report today on that front.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Craig Larson for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, operator, for your help. And thank you, everybody, for joining our call. We look forward to giving you an update next quarter. And for any follow-up items, of course, please feel free to reach out to [indiscernible] or me directly. Thank you once again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] Also this call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Krystal. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined by Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO, and for the first time on one of these calls, I'm pleased to be joined by Rob Lewin our CFO. As you know, Rob was named CFO in connection with Bill Janetschek's retirement. We'd like to remind everyone that, we'll be refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary deck on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call and I'm going to begin by referencing Pages 2 and 3 of that deck. Focusing first on Page 2. Most importantly, the earnings power of the firm continues to grow nicely as you can see from the charts on the left hand side of the Page. Our AUM is a $218 billion while book value is $19.24 per adjusted share. As you know, we're big believers in the power of compounding and we've been seeing that power through our book value. Over the last year, book value per share grew 24%, that's one of the largest increases we've seen over any 12 month period as a public company. And over the last three years, we've compounded book value per share 17% each year. And remember, in addition to this compounding, dividends are being paid out alongside. Looking at the right hand chart of Page 2, management fees have been growing steadily, up 15% year-over-year given our asset growth and after-tax distributable earnings, totaled $1.4 billion for the trailing 12 months, down from last year, partly due to realized gains being lower in 2019. Rob and Scott are both going to talk about your visibility here in a few minutes. Page 3 of the supplementary deck provides a snapshot of some of the headline numbers for the quarter as well as for the year. After-tax distributable earnings came in at $375 million for the quarter or $0.44 on a per adjusted share basis. Fee related earnings for the quarter were $271 million, and on a full-year basis, were just over a billion. Year-over-year, our AUM and fee paying AUM were up 12% and 14% and both increased 5% compared to 9/30. Looking at organic fundraising activity, we had our most active fundraising quarter of the year in Q4, driven by number of our younger platforms and strategies. In Private Markets, we held the first close in our Asia infrastructure strategy and had inflows across four real estate strategies. We also raised capital for the second iteration of our next-generation technology growth strategy, and with our final close here early in 2020, the second fund is over three times the size of the first. In Public Markets, we've raised in Australia listed permanent capital vehicle and saw inflows in the several credit products, including our leverage credit and CLO businesses. And also off note during the quarter, we closed on the final 5% of our partnership with Marshall Wace, bringing our total ownership to 40%. Since we announced the first step of our partnership here in September 2015, AUM of Marshall Wace has increased from $22 billion to $45 billion. And from an investing standpoint, Q4 was our most active deployment quarter of 2019 as we invested over $4 billion in both Private and Public Markets. In Private Markets, investment activity reflects really two things, the global nature of our footprint as well as the increasing diversification across our strategies. Private equity investment activity was mostly out of Europe and Asia. This was true in the fourth quarter as well as for the year. Investment activity outside of private equity continues to grow in significance. PE represented a little less than half of the $4.5 billion of capital invested in Private Markets for the quarter and a little more than half of the $14 billion of capital invested over the year. As our core equity, infrastructure, real estate, and growth equity platforms are scaling, we're seeing the impact of this through the deployment figures. Public Markets investment activity also exceeded $4 billion in the quarter with activity here driven by the opportunities in our private credit business in the U.S. as well as European. And for the year, Public Markets deployment was $10 billion, an increase of 45%. As with Private Markets as our credit platform is scaling, you're seeing the impacts of that through these deployment statistics. And with that, I'm pleased to introduce everyone to Rob Lewin. Rob joined KKR 16 years ago and for the first half of his career worked in a private equity business as an investment professional, both here in the U.S. as well as in Asia. And for the second half of his career, when Rob and his family returned to the U.S., he's held a series of positions across our other businesses co-heading KKR Credit and Capital Markets and also serving as a Treasure and Head of Corporate Development. Most recently, Rob has headed Human Capital and Strategic Talent for us. Rob?
Rob Lewin: Thanks a lot, Craig, and hello everyone. It's a pleasure to be on the call this morning and I hope to have the opportunity to meet and get to know many of you over the months and quarters ahead. I'd also like to thank Bill for his leadership of KRR's finance function over the last 20 years. Our finance team has a tradition of operational excellence and first rate controls. I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition. Turning to our financials for the quarter. Management fees, as Craig noted, continued to trend very well, up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and up 15% for the year. In Capital Markets, transaction fees for the quarter totaled $107 million and $410 million for the full year. These are very solid results for us, but both numbers are down from our record results in Q4 2018 and full year 2018. I will circle back to our Capital Markets business in a moment. Turning to monetization activity in the quarter. We had $245 million of realized performance income and $226 million of total realized investment income. Carry generating exit activity this quarter was driven by a number of European and Asian investments. These exits were accomplished at a blended multiple of approximately 2.8 times of our cost. Moving to our expenses. Compensation and benefits, which included the equity based comp, came in at $358 million for the quarter or 37% of our total revenue. For the year, total compensation was 39% of revenue, both figures are below our low 40s compensation ratio target. Occupancy taken together with other operating expenses came in at $122 million. Other operating expenses were more elevated in the fourth quarter, primarily due to $20 million of non-recurring expense related to the Australian-listed permanent capital vehicle that Craig mentioned earlier on the call. Putting this all together, including a 12% tax rate for the quarter, after-tax distributable earnings were $375 million or 40% per share. I thought I would pause here and spend a minute on our Capital Market business. We have worked very hard over the last decade to diversify this business from a small U.S. based team that was focused primarily on KKR private equity deals. Today, our Capital Market business has meaningful breadth across asset class, product, and [audio gap] that diversification resulted in over 60% of our Capital Markets revenue coming from outside the U.S. in 2019 and around a quarter of our revenue coming from non-KKR clients. As a result of this increase rack, we now have the business to a point where baseline quarterly revenue should be in the $50 million to $70 million range. This was driven by ordinary course financing and refinancing activities, assuming reasonable capital market conditions. In addition to that base line revenue, we have also positioned ourselves to be a meaningful participant in several large transactions a year, which is why the business has exceeded $100 million of revenue in six of the last eight quarters, and also averaged almost $500 million of revenue over the last three years. In short, our business now has a more baseline revenue component, which we think we can grow overtime together with upside from larger deal activity. As we look forward to Q1 2020, we don't have any of those large transactions in the pipeline. So, the expectation from here is that our Capital Market revenue in Q1 is more likely in that $50 million to $70 million range, which is consistent with Q1 of 2019. Now, most important, as we think about the growth of our distributable earnings over the next several years, really all of the core fundamentals in our business are at record levels. Our fee paying assets under management, they're up 14% this year and currently stand at a $161 billion. That's the highest it has ever been and that is in to advance of some our larger strategies that are set to raise funds over the next 12 to 18 months. Our net unrealized carried interest is up 62% year-over-year. This is driven by both robust performance across our various strategies and the significant increase in our carry eligible AUM that is above its respective hurdle. You can see that on Page 4 of the supplemental deck. Two years ago, around half of our carry eligible AUM, was in a position to pay carry as over $55 billion with seasoning and still working its way through preferred returns. Fast forward two years, the amount of capital in a position to pay carry has now increased 60% to $93 billion. And finally, our balance sheet is stronger today than it is ever been. Over the last several years, our balance sheet has been accruing significant gains, which you're clearly seeing come through in book value compounding, but we are not yet realizing those gains through distributable earnings. If you look at the last three years, our balance sheet investments have averaged a 15% return and our realized performance has averaged 7%. In 2019, this difference was even more extreme. As we generated 25% return, but our realized performance was 6%. This has generated a record few billions of embedded gains on our balance sheet, which create significant visibility for us around our long-term distributable earnings trajectory. Let me now pivot from the numbers themselves and spend some time on our investment performance. We saw a very strong performance across our major investing platforms in 2019. Looking at Page 5 of the supplemental presentation, our recent private equity flagship fund depreciated by 29% this year, and the PE portfolio in its entirety appreciated by 27%. Our flagship real estate and infrastructure funds appreciated 24% and 13%, respectively. Energy income and growth did decline for the year, given the volatility in the asset class, but this is a relatively small strategy for us today at about 1% of our assets under management. Our credit business had solid performance with our alternative and leverage credit strategy returning to 8% and 9% on a blended basis. And finally, as you've likely seen in the press release, we've announced an increase in our dividends. We set our current annual dividend of $0.50 per share when we converted through a corporation in the middle of 2018. For 2020, we have increased our dividends of $0.54 for the year, an 8% increase. This is consistent with our stated intention to grow the dividend overtime while still retaining most of our earnings to invest back into the firm and also to support our share buyback activities. Focusing on buybacks, since we initiated our share repurchase program, in total, we used over $1 billion to retire shares at a weighted-average cost of just under $18 per share, that's $1.30 below our current book value per share. And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Rob, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. I'm going to touch on 3 topics this morning. The first is 2019. As you heard from Craig and Rob, we finished the year well. Most important is the progress we made over the course of the year. Management fees were up 15% while book value per share grew 24%, and our return on equity which we look at on a month basis, was 24% for the year. Our model of third-party assets plus capital markets plus our balance sheet is working. And in 2019, we grew virtually all our businesses and launched several new platforms, including a number of strategies in Asia as well as our global impact effort. So, we're pleased with the year and view our progress as an important bridge to the opportunity we have ahead of us. This brings me to my second topic, visibility. We have more visibility now than I can recall in our 10 years as a public company. As introduced on this call last quarter, we expect to launch fundraising for our three largest flagship funds over the next several months. And over the next 3 years, we expect to be fundraising for over 20 additional strategies, many of which are now between fund 2 and fund 5 with strong track records on top of a growing investor base. In addition, our unrealized carried interest is up to 62% over the last 12 months, and our cash carry eligible AUM is up 60% over the last few years. Given all this visibility, our confidence is high. Assuming the fundraising environment continues to cooperate and we continued investment performance, we believe, we can grow our management fees by at least 50% over the next 3 years. And about 18 months ago, at our July 2018, Investor Day, we shared with assumptions more conservative than our actual experience. We felt, we could double pre-tax distributable earnings and book value per share over the next 5 years, and then roughly do it again, over the subsequent products. Given our progress and visibility, our conviction in being able to exceed these numbers is higher today than it was 18 months ago. Finally, I want to discuss our shareholder base. As you know, we've converted to a C-Corp about 18 months ago. We felt changing our corporate structure would make our stock easier to buy and easier to own, greatly expanding the universe of investors that could own our stock. That has proven to be the case. We've seen a significant change in our investor base with many more mutual funds and index funds owning our stock, and we've been added to several indices. We're still introducing ourselves to investors that are new to the space and new to KKR. So, the full impact of the C-Corp conversion we believe is not yet in our stock. As we've been out meeting new investors, we have learned that many are benchmark indices that we are not in today and they are less likely to be shareholders of ours as a result. One of the largest index families where we are not included is the Russell. We believe being part of Russell's indices would allow us to further our goal of broadening our shareholder base and is the sensible next step on our journey to getting proper price discovery and a proper valuation for our stock. So, we're discussing with our Board taking the steps necessary to be included in the Russell indices when they rebalance this spring. We will keep you posted on the details. We thank you for your partnership and we're happy to take your questions. And Krystal, we could ask everybody, I just going to say, ask everyone in the queue, if they wouldn't mind asking one question a follow-up. That would just let us to make sure we work our way all through the queue. Thanks in advance.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler: So, Scott, really appreciate the commentary around the Russell 1000 at. We think you'll get a nice benefit from that in terms of the shareholder base on evaluation, but as you look at what you need to do in terms of corporate governance and moving a small amount of voting rights in flow? From your side of things, what really is the big thing you have to give up, like, why wouldn't you do it?
Craig Larson: Let me just take the first part of that and let Scott add -- Craig, it's as Craig, look. First, we actually like to thank you for your thoughts and persistence on this issue. I know you've asked us as well as their peers about this for a few earnings cycles in a row now. But look, I think overall as it relates to incremental buying that can come from two places. First, our ETFs and strategies that are linked directly to the Russell 1000, 2000; and the math for that's pretty straightforward, I know you and most of your peers have done that. And the second piece really relates to mutual funds that are benchmarks to those indices, and our ability to market ourselves through those institutions and increase our mindshare. And so, as we look at it, it's really the second piece that to us, we think we can be more powerful than the first. Now, it's not going to be immediate, it's going to take elbow grease and some fortitude, but that's okay. So, as we put those two pieces together and gain conviction, it just felt like that was a sensible next step for us and trying to get proper valuation.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Craig. It's Scott. Look, I think what you should take from this is that we're working with our Board to take the steps required for Russell inclusive. So, the answer to your question is that we are in that process right now and that's our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.
Patrick Davitt: I thought I missed this, but could you give the pipeline of announcement not closed carry and investment income?
Rob Lewin: It's Rob. We think we have -- yes. So, based on where we are today, we have either closed or signed approximately 700 million worth of deals across our realized carried interest and realized investment income. We would expect that 700 million to be realized through the first half of 2020. As a point of comparison, it's probably helpful. This number was roughly 400 million at this time last year. So, we feel pretty good at this stage of the year as it relates to what our exit profile looks like.
Patrick Davitt: Awesome, thank. And then, I think it's widely known that KKR is more exposed to China than some of cops. Could you please update us on the PE portfolio's exposure there? And any broader thoughts you have on your view of the exposure to the coronavirus?
Craig Larson: Yes, thanks Patrick. It's Craig and we have been asked by a number of folks, if we could quantify our direct presence in China. So, the largest part of our business in China is within Private Equity. And when you look at the fair value of investments the companies based in China as a percentage of our AUM, it's a low single-digit percentage of our AUM. So, it's between a 1% and a 1.5%. Just to answer, now again, there is obviously a very large human element as it relates to what everyone is experiencing, but in terms of the specific question, that's the exposure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Gerry O'Hara: Great, thanks, maybe one for Scott. You've touched sort of those 20 strategies that are coming to market over the next 12 to 18 months perhaps even sooner. But I think kind of going back to the Investor Day comments, you talked about some of them being perhaps closer or coming up on respective inflection points. I don't know if there is some that have made more progress since then than others or some of these perhaps would highlight is kind of nearing that quarter-on-quarter inflection point that might be worth highlighting? Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks Gerry. I'm going to ask Craig to do the first part and I'll give some thoughts on the back end.
Craig Larson: Yes, sure. So, and Gerry, thanks for the question. So last quarter, as I know, you will remember, we highlighted the three benchmark strategies that we expect to be launched over the coming 12 months that's Asia PE, Americas PE and Global Infra; and we're fundraising for our Asia PE strategy currently. Now, alongside of that, we also have noted that there were over 20 additional strategies that we expect to be fundraising over the next three years. So, I think overall from a scaling aspect, there are actually a few prongs to this. The first is that, moving from fund 1 to fund 2, to 3 to 4, I think that piece is pretty easy to understand. This quarter, the growth that we've seen in our next-gen tech fund with its final close, this quarter being three times the first is a great example. Second part of the geographic expansion, again, we talked to the first close this quarter of our global infrastructure strategy, relative -- excuse me, our asia infrastructure strategy as a geographic expansion alongside of our global infrastructure presence. Third would be adjacencies for fundraising for core real estate strategy that fits nicely within the suite of strategies we have within real estate. And that's alongside of the growth and scaling we have from our distribution channels, insurance and retail or both topics we've touched on historically as well as our PE expansion. So, I think you've combined all of those things and we see certainly a lot of upside, and as Scott had referenced on the call the conviction that we have in our ability to at least see management fees for at least by 50% again over the next 6 years. Now, in terms of your question on scaling and timing, we don't have any specific guidance on when you would see that. Again, we've launched fundraising for one of those three benchmark strategies. We haven't launched fundraising for the other two benchmark strategies. So, I think in that three year timeframe, reasonable to think that again that run rate number really you would see the back end of that period, but we feel very good about the opportunity we have and the first steps we're taking.
Rob Lewin: Gerry, the one thing I'd add is that, the Investor Day and subsequently, we have shared slides on kind of showing where we are for some of these platforms relative to where the largest player is in. As a reminder, we only want to be in business is where we think, we are on a path to be top 3. And so, the point we've been trying to make is there's a ton of opportunity for us to meaningfully scale a number of these businesses that we started. I think the short answer of your question is, we are on track or ahead today and where we thought we would be. When we put that slide up for the first time in 2018 and that's everything from infrastructure, real estate equity and credit growth, core equity, and then our broader corporate credit business, which we're focused on doubling again from here. So, I feel really good about it and several of those are right in that inflection point today or nearing it. So, that's one of the reasons you hear us speaking with such conviction on the visibility that we have for the firm.
Gerry O'Hara: And then just a follow-up around the dividend and the decision to increase it, perhaps some of the inputs or metrics that you kind of look to, clearly, FRE is probably one of them, but kind of just, if you could help us understand how you're comfortable increasing that dividend, I think it's a percent in the coming year? Thank you.
Rob Lewin: No problem. There's not one specific metric that we take a look at. Really, we're focused on what the overall growth of our business profile looks like. What we have said and continued to believe is that, we want to increase our dividends overtime as the business scales, but we also want to share that we're ensured that we're retaining a significant amount of our capital to reinvest back into our business where we continue to see a ton of opportunity and also have additional capital available for share buyback activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America.
Mike Carrier: Scott, first, just on the visibility. So you went through fundraising even that makes sense the net accrued on the realizations, tough to predict, but it sounds like the outlook is pretty good there. I guess just your comments on the balance sheet. Like how should we be thinking about the appreciation that we see relative to the realization pace? And how does that maybe shift or pick up? Like, will it just be in line with realization activity, anything that's more nuanced there?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks Mike. Look, I think the message on the balance sheet is that it's been performing really well. As you can see from the charts in the deck, we've continued to see very attractive compounding over the course of the last year, which is just continuing what we've seen since we changed the dividend policy at the end of 2015. So, the message is that we're really pleased with the underlying performance of the balance sheet. I think we've been very happy with the repositioning that we've made it and we're getting closer to our asset allocation targets. So, it's all going according to plan. In terms of how do you think about how much of that we're going to realize that is going to be very hard to give you any specific guidance, but what I will tell you that we watched is, what is the embedded unrealized gains that we have within that balance sheets. And the point is that we're trying to make, if you look at some of the slides and you look at Slide 6 in particular in the deck. It's the unrealized gains continues to increase. We're now at a record level. So embedded within that 22 billion of balance sheet assets is a $2 billion unrealized gains that we think will be realized over the next several years. And that's on top of the regular way dividends and other investment income that we received from the balance sheet. So what I would tell you is, expect to see a general upward bias as we continue to execute our balance sheet strategies. So that upward bias would not only be on book value per share, but also overtime unrealized gains and investment income.
Mike Carrier: And then just on a follow-up. Rob, you've mentioned the comp ratio coming in a little bit better the quarter and then even a full year below that 40. Just trying to understand like, should we read something into this in terms of you seeing that trend down, as you're going to continue to scale the business or is it a little too early to be thinking that the comp ratios had lower?
Rob Lewin: Sure, as a starting point, I'd focus on the annual numbers and less the quarterly numbers and so we're at 39% this year and 40% last year of what we communicated. As you know, is that we're targeting a low 40% level that is build a target. But we certainly hope to continue to scale our revenue and be in a position where we can bring that number down over time. And as we think about comp margin, we also do keep a close eye on overall operating margins, which were at 50% for the year and other target for us, and I do think it's fair to say that as we thought about our Q4 comp margin, we certainly had an eye towards that 50% overall margin and wanted to try and achieve that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr: So, thinking about your capital markets comments, and they're a little lower than the last time I think you talk to us. And what's interesting is your commentary about the forward pipeline and the 700 million worth of deals up from 400. Those two things don't have to be mutually exclusive, but they're interesting to me. So, I guess the question is. Is it feels like you're confident in your capital raising and your exits and your realizations, but yet the capital markets keeps coming down? Is it just less, a few less big chunky deals? Or is there anything to be said about pricing? And what you capture on those deals. I am just trying to square those two.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, thanks for the questions, Glenn. I appreciate you're clarifying. So, let's take it in pieces. To be clear, the 700 million of unrealized gains that we expect to be coming through, sorry, in terms of carry and unrealized gains on the balance sheet, that's on the exit side. So, those are things that we are exiting from the portfolio. And for the most part, exits don't result in capital markets fees. Where the capital markets fees tend to come from is exits that may be related to things like IPOs, or secondary's. But the vast majority of the capital market fees are probably going to be from newer transactions or refinancings or activities in the portfolio on a regular way basis. So that's the first distinction I want to make. The second thing I want to make clear is we are not guiding you down on capital markets. What we're trying to do is make sure that you understand how we see the capital markets business from quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of that is going to be driven by that new deal activity or that refinancing activity level that I referenced. And so it's purely us is trying to give you a sense for what we see in terms of how the business is beginning to function, which is a baseline, that even without large new deal activity, which we see a significant amount of confidence. And that's that 60 to 70 range that Rob mentioned. And then on top of that, when we have large transactions, like we did in Q4, you will see some potentially meaningful upsides. And that's how you get to this kind of 100 million plus kind of numbers that we've been recording six over the last eight quarters. And that's why we've been averaging about $450 million, $500 million a year for the last few years. So we're just trying to do the build up with you so that we have a way of talking about it with you going forward. And hopefully can help you understand you know why the results are coming out the way they are.
Glenn Schorr: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. One more quickie. The press has somehow gotten a hold of the notion that the private equity business is starting to get more activist in nature and taking minority pieces and in public company and being more aggressive on that front. I'm just, one of your investments in one of the Argos, so I'm just curious, to get on your thoughts on, if you feel like there is anything different at all going on in terms of how you go about your PE business?
Scott Nuttall: Short answer is no and we saw the articles too, I think just to be real clear on elaborating. So I think this is a Dave & Buster's investment that we made that got some attention. I think frankly, we got a quite a bit of attention because of the consumer services nature. But to be clear, there's nothing new here from our standpoint. We made 40 investments over the last several years. In public companies $3 billion and we're not activists in the traditional sense. We're working with the management teams of those companies in a constructive manner. I think that the press did a bit, frankly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Great, thanks. Good morning everybody, and Rob welcome to the call. The follow-up on capital management I guess. Scott, you've underscored significant visibility in your growth, both from management fees and carries as well as balance sheet realization. And appreciated the dividend increase of 8%, but the dividend yield is around 2%, that's obviously below your peers and below financial broadly. I guess given the confidence in the business, what would it take for you guys to peruse more aggressive capital return strategy whether it's a bigger buyback given comments around valuation or high dividend? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Alex, I think we're really happy with our strategy. So, I think the way we think about it is we changed dividend policy at the end of 2015, we basically, we're targeting a level that was at about S&P 500 or S&P Financials dividend yield. And, not to say that the hard and fast rule, but that's we have been in and around there since we made that change to bit below. And as you can see, what's been happening since we made that change and the book value per share has been compounding and we've bought back quite a bit of stock along the way. I think you should expect us to continue that general capital management policy, which is a steady annual increase in the dividends, and then buybacks that really are used at a minimum offset share dilution from compensation. And so, those two elements of our strategy we are very pleased. We think that will allow us to compounded book value per share to very attractive rate, and also give us a capital we need to invest in growth.
Alex Blostein: And then my follow-up around management fee growth. If we look at this quarter, sequential growth, it was up modestly. But if you look at fee AUM is actually quite up a bit quarter-over-quarter, I think you talked about 5%. Can you help to reconcile I guess and just walk us through any timing dynamic that may have delayed some of the management fee recognition in Q4 that would help you guys to get it out in Q1, starting to see probably a higher ratio?.
Rob Lewin: Hi, Alex, this is Rob. It's a timing issue. We had a couple of fund strategies that closed at the end of the quarter. One that was meaningfully sized and so it shows in our U.S. asset under management and so we're not going start collecting management fees until Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee: First question, as it gets kind of made me a little more kind of, how you think of running the business. I mean, expanded, as you pointed out a lot over the last couple years, have 20, strategies are raising for in different in, most of which are comparatively newer to the firm, at least we're less than a 5 plus years. So I'm just curious how you've had to change or alter your investment process. How you're kind of decision making happening? And then with that, have you seen any kind of pressure to change what's your somewhat unique kind of comp structure compared to some of your peers?
Rob Lewin: So high level, you're right. We have created a number of new strategies over the course of the last several years. And as we talked about in the past, right, 18, the 22 investment strategies we have with the firm are new in the last decade, but the number of those businesses were started now multiple years ago. So 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, it probably felt like there was a much higher percentage of brand new. As we sit here today is we're getting on the fund 2, fund 3 for a number of these strategies. We actually don't feel as new as an enterprise as we did at that point, internally. And so in terms of the running of the business, the investment process, the short answer is we haven't had to change it. And what we have done is we've created investment committees that are relevant to each of those strategies, and portfolio committee that are relevant each of those strategies, which is how we run the firm a very long time. We have hired people into the firm to help us fill those businesses alongside existing, taking our executives. And everyone was hired into the firm's one firm comp structure. So everyone signed up for the culture and the compensation structure that we've always operated under. So there's no change there either. And so as we built those around the world and across strategies, we've been very purposeful and trying to make sure that we do it the way we built all KKR businesses. And so it really hasn't been the things that we've had pressure on changing our process, or changing our comp structure away from what you would normally expect, given some of these businesses are a little bit more market facing than some others.
Robert Lee: And maybe follow-up, being you've clearly highlighted the potential for realizations overtime with the building capacity there. But clearly is investors seem to be on a kind of concerned about the potential for you and your peers to kind of get those realizations over the, let's called the intermediate term. So understanding you can predict specifics and you gave the color on what you have and so far. But is there any color you can give on how we should be thinking about where you think most likely realizations is the U.S., Asia, kind of any kind of sense of for thinking of your potential in the next day year to, where you think that, what may dry that and a high level?
Rob Lewin: I think it's pretty broad base. But we're seeing inside of the firm is that a number of the businesses that we just talked about, that were created over the last 5 to 10 years and you understand that the management teams show up before the carry. But a number of those businesses are now maturing and a number of those pools of capital are getting into their carry earning and carry paying years. And that's part of the reason you could see the Slide 4 of the deck that Rob walk through that 58 billion of cash carry paying AUM going to 93 billion. That is very broad base when you look beneath it. Is Asia, Europe and the U.S. and it is across multiple different businesses and strategies. And so this, when we think about the latent earnings power of the firm, part of the reason we have this confidence is we have been watching these investments mature and now would be a, these funds being above their hurdle rate and getting into the cash carry paying face. And so it is really broad base, there's no specific team I would call out for you. And that's part of the reason that we continue to see our carry diversifying and continuing to increase.
Scott Nuttall: Rob, one thing, it's quite one thing I would add, it is interesting when you look at the overall PE performance in 2019. The portfolio as a whole was up 27%. Our privates were up 17%. So certainly strong performance as relates to the private part of the portfolio. Our public's we're up over 60%. And so often as it relates to those companies that are our public, those often are more mature investments for us. And you've seen some of the benefits of that even in the second half of the year with investments and monetization, as we've seen in companies like SoftwareONE and Trainline. Such as, again, I think that's another interesting data point.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. So I guess what I would say, Rob, is I wouldn't get too worried about what happens in any one quarter. Well, we keep an eye on those two embedded gains on the balance sheet as we referenced, and then the unrealized carried within our underlying AUM and both of those are at record levels and up significantly over the last 12 months. And so that's we're keeping an eye on for both the near-term and the intermediate term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris Harris: A few questions on your incentive fees, I guess the first part is. Why were Marshall Wace incentive fees so low this quarter? It sounds like the growth has been pretty good over there. And then also, I think that that line item is being impacted by lower BDC fees. So how much revenue is attributable to that, and what needs to occur for the BDC incentive fees to be recovered?
Craig Larson: Hey, Chris, this is Craig. Let me take the first crack to that. So, as it relates to incentive fees, they were about 1.5% of our total revenues in 2019, a little less than that in terms of Q4. And the answer to the first part of your question does really relate principally to timing. So, our largest hedge fund partnership incentive fees crystallized on 9.30. And we report those results on a one quarter lag. So we see those through our financials in Q4. So broad markets, in broad markets even think back to the fourth quarter of last year's I'm sure you remember was a very volatile. The S&P was down about 14%. So the impact of this actually had no bearing on the incentives fee and recognized in Q4 a year ago. And instead, we felt that impact in our Q4 results for this year given the timing of when that incentive fee crystallizes. So, that's what you see as it relates to that dynamic. And then overall in terms of where we're, again incentive fee is right, but we get incentive fees from our hedge fund partnerships. Those do tend to crystallize annually and you will tend to see that in the fourth quarter. And then the second place we see incentive fees is from a handful of credit-oriented strategies and platforms largest of which is BDC platform. Now, in terms of the BDC platform, we actually a little cautious in terms of how you talk about this because again in this line item is a small topic for KKR. Again, it's a 1.5% of our total revenues. It's a more significant topic for our publicly listed BDC that hasn't reported their results yet. But in terms of that NAV FSK, FSK did said on our last earnings call that they expect incentive fees over the next few quarters to be muted and I think really consistent with that disclosure and that's what you saw in Q4. That's about 80% of the incentive fees for KKR in Q4 were driven by those hedge fund partnerships. Does that make sense?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell: A lot of my questions were answered, but maybe just to zoom in a little more on the capital markets in the $50 million to $75 million quarterly run rate. I think you mentioned, I think Rob you mentioned 25% of the revenue from the Capital Markets businesses outside of KKR. Just wondering if that also applies to that $50 to $75 million core run rate and then maybe you talk about the efforts to grow that revenue stream outside of KKR or is the 50 to 75 really just the KKR base?
Rob Lewin: No, Brian. That's 50 to 70 range that we gave would include our third-party Capital Markets business and we pay those at decent role of sum. So, right now, that's going to be roughly a quarter of our business going forward. In terms of being able to grow that baseline I think that comes from two areas. I think that comes from a continued growth of the KKR platform across different asset classes and continued penetration of our third-party Capital Market that has a lot of momentum right now. S, those will be the two areas that we think will help to get that base line number up overtime.
Brian Bedell: Okay.
Rob Lewin: Just to be really clean Brian, just to jump in. So, the 50 to 70 again, excludes what we seeing from the larger transactions. Last two years, we deployed and it's indicated a sum total about $30 billion per year. So, we expect to have large transactions over the course of any given year and the messages in some quarters, they close and in some quarters they don't and that's over time to clarify. But, to be clear, the 15 to 70 without those and something like Q4, which is a $107 million we have one of those close. So, we're just trying to be transparent with it.
Brian Bedell: Yes, totally and they could be lumpy within KKR and the third-party as well. And then it's a lumpy part of that would have been the addition to the addition to the 50 to 70 really could be anywhere and then there also much more heavily skewed just the KKR deals.
Rob Lewin: I'd say the larger deals are going to be likely more skewed, especially the ones where we make 30 to 70 million per transaction, they tends to have an equity and debt syndication element. You can have A larger third-party deal as well, but they tend to top out in the 10 of $20 million range just to give a sense.
Brian Bedell: And then may be Scott, just if you want to comment a little bit on the deployment environments given obviously market have moved quite nicely this year and valuations you know are stretched. You know, where do you guys see better opportunities? Where you are more cautious or you in general about the deployment environment, you know, more questions overall or continue to see plenty of opportunities to give your finances investment capabilities.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, let me just give the high level and I like Craig run through kind of what we're seeing around the world. I'd say on the whole, the average is live. So when you're looking at a market multiple, we're finding that that really is a very, very misleading statistic. The markets are incredibly bifurcated. And so, we're seeing significant dispersion and multiples, it's the half have not dynamic, we talked about the last few quarters where you got growth in simplicity, valuation multiples, incredibly high, if you've got complexity or less growth, you can be left behind by the market. So, we're really seeing this dynamic around the world of a bifurcated market and in the U.S., certainly, and in other parts of the world, a bifurcated economy. And so within all of that you have a lot of complexities and refining a lot to do, but it is not stuff that would be apparent reading the popular price. It's very much on the ground type work and the overall theme, I would say is we're continuing to buy that complexity and sell into the market what the markets want, which is that simplicity. And so with, all that is kind of a global overarching kind of all product area statement. Craig, when you run through what some of the themes are most focused on?
Craig Larson: I'd say, Brian, let me touch on private markets, first, few things to know. First, as it relates to private equity. We have been seen more opportunity better risk reward outside of U.S. And part of that is valuation related if you look at total returns over the last 5 years returns of the S&P has exceeded the MSCI Asia-Pacific by almost 2 times. So I think we have been seeing that risk reward and you see that in some of the deployment figures. And some of that is secular, so we talked about cause for some time of the drivers of our activity in Japan, in that continues. Activity in Europe almost has three prongs. So there are corporate partnerships. There are growth and tech opportunities. And we're making investments alongside of families. We've done this recently Germany as well as Sweden. Asia again, we talked about the partnerships in Japan. We acquired Campbell's international as a carve-out from Campbell Soup company for our core strategy, another example of a carve-out transaction. And I think in an area like infrastructure, we've been leaning into mid-stream. So over the course of the year, we closed out of Western Canadian midstream joint venture in all the pipeline investment in Abu Dhabi. So that's been inactive area as well. And again, as I think as it relates to public markets. I think what, and we touched on this in the prepared remarks. The activity that we saw in private credit, both here and in Europe was interesting. The syndicated market in the second half of last year was very unfriendly to new issuers in a something whether well-known to the market recession was very poor, again goes back to now this Scott. Now, this backdrop will be great for private credit solutions and that's really what you saw in the back half from deployment standpoint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Chris Kotowski: This was the second quarter in a row where your interest and dividend income was over 180 million and that line used to run like 60 million, 70 million. So I assume it's either some kind of dividend recap and/or margin on. And I'm wondering, does that relate just to your balance sheet investment? Or could you have margin loans against the carried interest receivable as well? Or does it?
Rob Lewin: So, that number is specifically around our balance sheet. In both cases, we did a dividend, a large dividend in both Q3 and Q4 out of Fiserv. I'd say on a run rate basis, well, they're not going to get a specific number. But your run rate, interested dividend line item is going to be closer and more in the ballpark of what it was in Q4 of 2018 and what has been in Q3 or Q4 of 2019.
Chris Harris: Okay. When you say you did a dividend out of Fiserv?
Rob Lewin: Basically what we did, Chris, is we did a second draw on the margin loan that we talked about last quarter against our Fiserv position. And so that was, but we shows up as a dividend as opposed to some kind of sale that's all.
Chris Harris: Okay. And it relates only to the balances position not to anything in the carried interest receivable that you've got a target.
Rob Lewin: That's correct.
Chris Harris: And when you reference the 700 million before that is in terms of carry or in terms of, I assume that's in terms of carry not in terms of transaction value?
Rob Lewin: So yes, that's right. That's both carry and as I realized carry, and a realized balance sheet investment income, and we think the first half of 2020. And we can see today and it's the end of January, I think, is the important point. So this, we will, that's why we got a lot of visibility even and it's not even February yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Just wanted to circle back on the deployment levels, they were up nicely year-on-year especially in the Public Markets segments. So I just curious how you would characterize the pace of deployment in 2019? Is this elevated in your view at all and how to think about the right pacing and run rate of deployment into 2020?
Rob Lewin: I don't think Michael, I would call it elevated, I just say one place, we probably did see it elevated over the course of the year, as Craig mentioned around private credit in the fourth quarter, which, if you look at our alternative credit strategies, we deployed 4 billion, that's a big number. If you were to analyze that I don't think, I think that would be a bit misleading. So when I look at the year as a whole, as I kind of mentioned over the last couple years, we've been in and around $30 billion of deployment and syndicated capital. And given our growing capital base and the growing activity we have all around the world. I think all else equal you would expect to see that number continue to go up.
Michael Cyprys: And just a follow-up maybe, to some retail initiatives, maybe if you could just update us on how much you raise in 2019 versus '18? And maybe talk about some of the new strategies you're introducing, the overall sort of approach to the retailed channel? And there's been some recent regulatory proposals out there, I guess, just how meaningful are you thinking about that for growth?
Craig Larson: Mike, it's Craig. Let me take the first part. So on the retail and high net worth side, the high net worth excuse me. Look, we've gone from about 9 billion of AUM in 2015 to 37 billion today. And so that CAGR is approaching 60%. And on the one hand, while those numbers are significant, and that dollar value is significant, it still feels to us like we're just getting started. But when you look at the capital that we raise from individuals, that's high net worth, ultra high net worth platforms, that number was about 20% of new capital raised in 2019 which is actually a little higher than that. So, it's a significant number and I think as we think about the opportunities in this channel, we do think our brand is something that is really helping for us. It's a great asset. Now, in terms of the end of the question as it relates to the definition of an accredited investor, a couple of thoughts there. Look, I think we're encouraged by the SEC's efforts to expand that definition in standard. Now in terms of activity to-date, almost all of our structures are private CCC 7 funds, which can only be offered to qualified purchasers as opposed to accredited investors. So, the impact of this in terms of what we've been doing is actually a little muted. However, looking forward, we have several initiatives for retail high network and development that we focus on the space. And so, I think the proposed amendment, if it's adopted would expand that pool of investors.
Rob Lewin: The only thing I would add Michael is a high level. We're going to be introducing multiple products into the retail space and we're hiring more people as we're staffing up to do even more retail over the next several years. And so, you will continue to hear us talk about that and my expectation is over time the number Craig mentioned, which is about 20% of last year's capital raised, that 20% I think is kind of going up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open.
Bill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for getting me on and Rob congratulations on the promotion. Just maybe to follow up on and I think maybe of these plans are embedded in your discussion about the outlook over the next couple of years. So, how you think about the impact on margins comes here? Obviously, you have a lot of things you're investing in, but at the same time you're scaling some of these very significantly. Can you continue to margin that margin up from here? Or is it more just sort of tow back in, sort of hold where you are as the asset scale?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Bill. It's Scott. Our expectations is, right, we are going to be continuing to scale our businesses and that will allow us to bring margins up. We're going to be in reinvesting some of that back into growth in distribution, technology and a number of other areas. Our view is that, net of all that will allow us to increase our margins over the next several years. And so, that should be your general expectation is that you will see that margin gravitate upward. We're not going to give any guidance per se by period, but that is what we are working to continuing that of the reinvestment.
Bill Katz: Great, that's helpful. And just one more conceptual coming back to like, what you might look like a couple of years from now. So, if you continue to scale your platform, a part of your balance sheet strategy has been to accelerate that scaling. And as you ultimately scale to where you think you can get, does the balance sheet just in general become a little less solid in that longer-term you might look to reconsider your payout ratio notwithstanding the fact you said in the near term no major changes?
Scott Nuttall: I think your expectations should be that we continue to grow our balance sheet while we continue to grow our feed paying AUM. I think that should be your general expectations. From a capital management standpoint, I think our investors should expect that we're going to continue to compound book value, while we compound AUM.
Craig Larson: And Bill, it's Craig. The only thing I'd add on that is, remember, employees own roughly 40% of the stock. So, there is great alignment in terms of the stock price, and that is something that from IR standpoint, we feel everybody when you go to lunch room. So, just kick that up in mind at the same time.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Just wanted on the balance sheet, wonder, how much was deployed and realized off balance sheets in the quarter?
Rob Lewin: We deployed off the balance sheet of roughly a $1 billion of capital through the year and then we monetize roughly 350 million of capital through the quarter. So 1 billion of deployment and 350 monetization.
Michael Cyprys: And that's for the quarter, right?
Rob Lewin: Yes.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session from today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Craig Larson for any closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Krystal. Thank you, everybody for joining the call. Please, of course, follow-up with us with any additional questions. We look forward to chatting next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] Also this call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thanks Norma. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual I'm joined by the Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. And the call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call and I'm going to begin by referencing Pages 2 and 3 of that deck. In summary, we're pleased with our fundamentals and how we're positioned looking forward. Focusing on Page 2 of the deck. Most importantly, the earnings power of the firm continues to grow nicely as can be seen by the charts on the left-hand side of the page. Our AUM is now $208 billion, while book value is $18.22 per adjusted share. As you know we're big believers in the power of compounding and we've been seeing that power through our book value. Over the last year book value per share grew 9%, well ahead of equity and fixed income indices. And over the last three years we've compounded book value per share 15% each year all while paying out dividends alongside of this. Looking at the top right-hand chart on Page 2, management fees have grown steadily up 16% year-over-year on an LTM basis due to asset growth in addition to a modest increase in the blended management fee rate in both private markets and public markets. And after-tax distributable earnings totaled $1.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. It's worth noting that strong investment performance has helped drive the 46% increase in the net unrealized carry figure on our balance sheet year-to-date despite generating over $800 million in realized carried interest over the nine months. This increase in the net unrealized carry balance should bode well over time in terms of realized carry and in turn our distributable earnings. Turning to Page 3 of the deck, you'll see some additional detail on our financial results. And please remember as you look through these that we do include equity-based compensation charges within our operating expenses as well as within our after-tax distributable earnings as we report our results. After-tax DE came in at $389 million for the quarter or $0.46 on a per adjusted share basis. Our compensation margin came in right at that 40% level and our pretax distributable operating earnings margin was a healthy 51%. Fee-related earnings for the quarter were $250 million and on an LTM basis are $1.1 billion. As we evaluate our performance there are five things we're focused on; we need to generate investment performance; raise capital; find attractive new investments; monetize existing investments; and finally use our model to capture more economics for everything that we do. I'll update you on our progress on the first two and Bill will cover the remaining three. Let's start with investment performance. I'll be referencing Page 4 of the deck. So, beginning with private equity, the private equity portfolio in its entirety appreciated 12% over the trailing 12 months. This compares favorably to the MSCI World that appreciated 2.4% on a total return basis. Where we saw a notable performance was in our flagship private equity funds as you see on the page. The blended performance across these funds these are our more recent vintages that have been investing for at least two years was quite strong appreciating 26% driven by Asia III. Our flagship real estate and infrastructure funds appreciated 21% and 9%, respectively while the commodity environment pressured our benchmark energy fund. Energy Income and Growth declined 15% on an LTM basis but performed well ahead of benchmark. And credit our alternative and leverage strategies have both appreciated 4% on a blended basis. Turning to fundraising, capital inflows totaled $5 billion in the quarter and $29 billion, over the last 12 months. We held the first close and the successor to our technology growth strategy, and had inflows across our European PE, real estate, credit and impact strategies, as well as the number of credit strategies including CLOs and leverage credit. Capital inflows over trailing 12 months have contributed to $57 billion of dry powder at quarter end. Importantly, we also have approximately $20 billion of capital commitments that become fee-paying, when they are either invested or in their investment period, at a weighted average rate of around 110 basis points, providing direct line of sight towards future management fees. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. I'll start with the third thing we need to do well, which is invest in new opportunities. Deployment this quarter in Public Markets was $2 billion, largely coming from our Private Credit strategies. Year-to-date, Public Markets deployment is $6 billion, up over 20% compared to the first nine months of 2018. In Private Markets, we invested $2.4 billion in the quarter, driven by private equity investments in Europe and the U.S. in addition to $400 million across our real estate strategies. Through the first nine months of 2019, Private Market is deployment is $10 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Now let's turn to monetization activity in the quarter. As reported in our monetization update in late September, activity this quarter was driven by both strategic transactions and secondary sales. We had just over $500 million of realized carried interest and investment income this quarter. We had our final exit in the quarter in both PRA Health and National Vision, at a blended multiple of five times our cost. And we're beginning to see realized carry from Public Markets with $15 million in Q3, and $10 million last quarter. Finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model to capture greater economics for our investors, and the firm. In Capital Markets this quarter transaction fees totaled $84 million. Now periodically, we'll have transactions that can lift capital markets fee in the quarter. We had two of those in the third quarter of last year that contributed over $100 million. While we didn't have any transactions of this size, this quarter, overall fundamentals remained quite healthy. Fees this quarter were generated across approximately 50 transactions. 25% of revenue in the quarter and year-to-date came from third parties. And a little over 40% of revenue this quarter was generated from outside the U.S., and year-to-date that percentage is 55%. So we're continuing to see diversification across the Capital Markets platform. Finally, let me give you a little color on monetization activities as we stand here today. Transactions that have closed or have been signed and are expected to close, should contribute $925 million in realized carried interest and realized investment income, in Q4 2019, or early 2020. Of that $925 million, we expect $375 million to close in Q4. And it's only the end of October. Turning to page five of the supplement, you'll see a summary of our core fundamentals, across the five categories. The power of our model is evident in our results. And we are quite pleased with the momentum we're seeing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. And thank you everybody for joining our call. Our results this quarter is straightforward, so I'm going to be brief. Last quarter, I discussed the powerful combination of more mature track records, and an expanding investor base. As a reminder, 18 of our current 22 investment strategies were launched in the last 10 years. And in our experience, it takes about a decade to start to achieve scale. So we have a lot of growth ahead. But it is also important to remember, that as we're building new investment businesses over the last 10 years, we've been simultaneously building our distribution capabilities. The results have been encouraging, with our investor base growing from 275 investors 10 years ago, to over 1,000 today. But we still have a long way to go. We see an opportunity to expand distribution to all channels, Institutional, insurance, and the retail and high net worth market. As we continue to generate investment performance, mature our track records, expand our distribution footprint, and create new products, we see significant growth ahead. I want to put this in perspective. Please take a look at Page six of the supplement. There you will see that our management fees have grown 50% over the last three years from about $800 million to $1.2 billion. Over these three years, organic new capital raised exceeded $90 billion. This was done with a significant number of first-time funds and a young distribution effort. Now look at the right-hand side of the chart. This shows the strategies where we expect to be fund-raising over the next three years. You will see the list includes our three largest funds, Asia PE, Americas PE, and global infrastructure which aggregate to $30 billion in their last vintage. But it also shows there's over 20 other strategy we expect to have in the market. So given, what's coming to market plus our ongoing distribution efforts, if the fundraising environment cooperates and we continue to perform, we believe we can grow our management fees by at least 50% again over the next three years. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Hey, great. Good morning, guys. So, Scott maybe on the last point that you mentioned starting on slide 6. Definitely encouraging to hear the 50% management fee growth over the next three years, but how should we think about the incremental margin on that growth given the fact so much of the investments I guess are already in place?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question, Alex. To be clear, I said at least 50% is what we're expecting, if the market cooperates. And I think as we've been talking about for the last several years you're right, we've been investing in bringing on new teams and a lot of that investment was coming ahead of the revenues. So we would expect there to be positive operating leverage over that period of time. We will continue to be making investments in a variety of new products and other initiatives for the firm, including building out distribution further. But even net of those new investments we'd still expect the operating margin to increase somewhat.
Alex Blostein: Great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up for Bill and Craig. Looking at $375 million and the $925 million in carry and realized income that you guys highlighted in 4Q and then into early 2020, does that include any sort of utilization from Fiserv on the margin loan arrangement you guys have set up? Or any of that monetization activity will be on top of the numbers you provided?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Alex this is Bill. Embedded in the $925 million is some portion of an expected Fiserv dividend in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind that's only one monetization out of a total of 11, when I count. And so when you think about at $925 million two were already secondaries that have already been completed which is SoftwareONE and Trainline. But more importantly, we have several strategic sales that have been signed that are expected to close in between now and Q1 of 2020 and that's both in the U.S. and in Japan and Korea. So a lot of opportunity from a monetization point of view.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. And Alex, its Scott just appreciate the question on Fiserv, because we've been getting this question a bit from our shareholders. And I think people have noted that the merger of Fiserv and First Data has caused Fiserv's stock to increase materially this year. To be clear from our standpoint, we think the market is still just beginning to understand the opportunity from that merger and we don't think the upside is yet reflected in Fiserv stock price. And so to your point, we did put in place a modest margin loan, so we could return some capital back to our investors, but keep the upside on those shares because we think there's quite a bit remaining.
Alex Blostein: Yes, makes perfect sense. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Rob.
Robert Lee: So maybe following up on kind of the fundraising, and I know you've – maybe Scott you've talked about this in the past. But can you update us on the kind of where you're LP base is now and maybe the success you have had so far and kind of getting investors invested in kind of multiple platforms? Just trying to see some updated numbers.
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Rob just thanks for the question. Look I think we continue to make good progress. So we're now a bit over 1,000 investors. On average, the cross-sell is about 1.9 products per client, but as you know when you're meaningfully expanding your investor base that tends to happen in one product at a time. So, even today we still only have 41% of our investors that are in more than one product. But just to give you a sense for the opportunity, the top 70, average 4.5 products. So we think that there's a significant amount of opportunity not only to expand the investor base, but also -- further, but also that cross-sell statistic. And as we said in the prepared remarks, I think there's opportunity institutionally. There's also opportunity in insurance. We've gone from $8 billion to $26 billion from the insurance market since 2015. There's also opportunity in the retail and high net worth market. We've gone from $9 billion there to $35 billion since 2015 and those are areas where we see significantly more opportunity ahead. So those are some stats for you, but long story short, we still see a lot of upside.
Robert Lee: Great. And maybe a follow-up for Bill, a little bit of a modeling question. But in tax rate, it was pretty low and I know it's hard to forecast quarter-to-quarter. But if I look at the balance sheet, it looks like tax assets have come down pretty -- you've utilized a bunch of tax assets the last several quarters. Should we be thinking that this changes maybe accelerate the path to kind of a more normalized tax rate that you're maybe realizing some of the assets a bit faster?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Rob. That's a good question and one that we spend a lot of time on each quarter. But based upon what we had originally said was where we thought that the tax rate was going to be in the high single-digit and walk its way all the way up to 21% from the Federal corporate level over five-year to six-year period that's are going to be the case. However to your point and it's a very good point to the extent that we actually have monetization that are accelerating and we're using that tax asset up in years one and two we might -- tax rate and you could see it then go up. So that's why you could see that last quarter our effective tax rate was 15%. This quarter for a whole host of different reasons it was actually only 9%. Again, I've said this probably on every call, it's incredibly hard to model out, but I would still stick with something in probably the low teens for the next year or two. But again, we'll try to make sure that you have as much information as us and we'll update that number probably just about every quarter.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks, Bill. Thanks for taking my question.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open.
Ben Herbert: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one would be just could you provide -- I know performance is very strong in the quarter, and this is Ben Herbert on for Bill. Just maybe some portfolio of company health update just metrics quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. Sure, Ben, it's Scott. I mean, the bottom line is it's been pretty consistent. So last 12 months about 10% revenue growth in the global PE portfolio and about 10% EBITDA growth. And it's been in that the area for the last several quarters.
Ben Herbert: Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up will just be how are you thinking about the fixed dividend policy currently and just kind of in light of pretty substantial cash build on the balance sheet year-to-date?
Bill Janetschek: No, news at this moment. It's a topic we've historically addressed on the fourth quarter call. But as we think about the dividend level remember that we have a disposition towards compounding, so retaining capital to invest back in the firm is always going to be important to us, and we want to preserve flexibility through share repurchases. That said, we should see an upward bias to the dividend over time. So the punch line is stay tuned to next quarter.
Ben Herbert: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Craig Siegenthaler: So just first on, Asia, can you update us on your strategy to broaden out the Asia business outside of the upcoming expected raise in the Asia buyout fund, including infrastructure private debt and real estate?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. It's Scott. So thanks for the question. You're right, a big priority for the firm this year was expanding our Asia platform outside of private equity and the summary is that we're on track. We have launched efforts across infrastructure, real estate, credit and we're also going to be launching an effort in technology growth as well with an Asia focus. So I think four new businesses focused on Asia, leveraging the footprint we already have. So you'll see us add people to be able to do that, but we're leveraging the team on the ground in the eight offices we have in the region.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks. And just a CFO question here for Bill on the FRE math. I'm just wondering in the quarter, how much base comp and non-comp expense was allocated against investment income in the quarter?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Craig, it's the same methodology that we've been using. If you take the fee income over the total income and then you take our operating expenses backing out stock-based comp and whatever that percentage is, is the amount allocated to fee-related earnings. You take a fee income, minus that number and that's how you get to the fee-related earnings number. So nothing's changed this quarter.
Craig Siegenthaler: Got it. Thanks, Bill. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Mike Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, just overall investment performance is strong across the board, ex the energy you pointed out. How have some of the trade concerns impacted your performance or not in the Asia strategy, because it doesn't look like it has? Or has it increased the demand in some of the private strategies given that some of the public markets have been more impacted?
Craig Larson: Mike, its Craig. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think, when we look at -- and again this is something that we've looked at very closely as you'd expect and the investments we've made in China have tended to be very focused on domestic consumption and not are really subject to the whims of trade negotiations. So when we look across the overall private equity portfolio revenues, as well as costs, the exposure to us is in that low single-digit range on both of those. And I think there is a -- on the flip side of that coin, I think, you're right. There can be opportunities resulting from what's going on from the trade front as it relates to investment opportunities. So, I think, the overall impact on the portfolio was one that is -- is one that's pretty small and the same point of time, we're trying to find ways to pursue opportunities, if there are companies that have decided to exit the region.
Mike Carrier: All right. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up. You guys mentioned some of the fundraising in the growth equity area. Just more curious, whether it's investment opportunities or like fundraising traction, like how that's been going with some of the recent like IPO issues relative to some of the private marks that are out there in the growth space.
Craig Larson: Look, I think, there are two aspects of that. There's the performance question within healthcare growth as well as the TMT Growth. And the statistics there on the first funds is a very positive answer on both of those. Again, we're fundraising on TMT so that's -- again you can certainly get a sense by looking at the fund table for the returns that we've seen. But I think it's been a very pleasant experience to date, as it relates to our LPs. And on the IPO market question, look, I think, a couple of thoughts overall. First, look, the IPO market is market of windows and it always has been and they're going to be times when that market feels more accessible than others. So remembering that, current dynamics, overall, don't really feel all that out of the ordinary. And when investors are pushing back, I think, from our standpoint that can be a sign of a healthy functioning market. I think, the second point, to be clear the IPO window is not shut. So at the end of last week we priced the IPO, SoftwareONE, a European portfolio company of ours. That IPO raised approximately $700 million. It was a sizable IPO. The book was well oversubscribed and the stock traded up 3% in its first day of trading. So investors may be more selective at the moment, but again the window is not shut. And then Mike just to add a little bit flavor and this is not really related to the growth portfolio, but in the framework of the firm overall, I think when we're asked about the IPO market, the underlying question often relates to the outlook for future monetizations and ultimately whether the coverage there and if we're going to be able to generate future DE. And from that standpoint, what's a bigger factor here actually isn't the IPO market. Remember, we're typically not selling stock in an IPO. It's the significance as well as the performance of the public holdings as a whole. So, from that standpoint, the publics are about 25% of the PE portfolio as a whole. Year-to-date, the publics are up 45%, so performance has been very strong. Now a statistic like that is always going to be helped when your largest holding is up over 80%. But just to be clear, performance is actually quite broad. So if you take First Data/Fiserv out of that math, the publics are still up 27% to nine 30. So again performance overall has been quite good.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. The only thing I would add Mike is that -- the only thing I would add is that, we have seen some pushback on a couple of Australian IPOs. But to Craig's point, it's a global market and I wouldn't extrapolate from that. There is a positive. To the extent, we do see the IPO market difficult it probably means it's less fun to be a public company. And so that means, there's more investment opportunities for us across the firm.
Mike Carrier: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr: Hello there. It might be related to Mike's question. If you look at your macro team, the great Henry McVey, if you look at their outlook of something whether it be a '01-like recession formally or something like a slowdown in '11, '12, his comments are interesting about a tipping point underscoring that low interest rates are not going to be the help for you to credit creation or equity valuation. So that's a long-winded lead-up to the question of how does that factor into both your capital deployment and capital markets activity. And I'll do my follow-ups separate.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for giving a nod to the great Henry McVey. I will -- I'd tell you, here's what we're seeing. I'd say we see basically an industrial recession we think now in the U.S. and Europe to a great extent. Consumer and services look okay, but we're watching the data closely. So to be clear, we are expecting whatever's coming to be kind of a more of a normal recession. But we're seeing a bit of a rolling recession right now, we believe really starting with the industrial sector U.S. and Europe. Asia is a bit of a different story. So we do see opportunity coming out of all of this. But as we think about -- to your question on deployment, as we think about how to invest into it, what we're seeing is there's more volatility in the market, there's more dispersion in the market. So we continue to see a have/have-not market and to some extent a have/have-not economy. And so as a result of that, where we're spending time is where the market is undervaluing companies. So we're finding complexity is punished, any change in outlook is punished and the market overall is quite skittish. And so, what we're seeing as a result of that is at the five-foot level where we operate, there's more interesting companies going private. There's interest from companies that want to make themselves simpler, so they're selling noncore assets. That's the global trend we continue to see. Our strategy continues to be buy complexity and sell simplicity. And we think, that's the strategy that works as we go into this part of the cycle, which we think is going to be far more of a normal recession than what happened last time.
Glenn Schorr: Very clear. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. When you look -- you talked about the statistics that you mentioned earlier on the penetration rates and the number of products. I'm curious about, how your relationship management function is going to change to improve those numbers and sell it to your current LP base, while you have 20-plus new strategies being rolled over the -- or raising capital some of them brand new over the next three years? Like in other words you raise money $94 billion in the last three years, should we be thinking semi-steady markets that's a lot more over the next three years given all the additional strategies and the penetration rate efforts?
Scott Nuttall: Well, I think if you look at the last three years we did not have the big three funds that I mentioned it's on the right-hand upper right-hand side of Slide 6 in the market in the way we will over the next three. So, that's the first thing I would say. So, all else equal, you'd expect that have a positive bias on the $90-plus billion number. And you're right on the bottom right-hand side, there's more strategies than we have the last three years as well. So, I think what we're saying to you is all else equal, we would expect to exceed that number for the next three years if the market cooperates. I think in terms of your question about relationship management, part of that is that our relationships continue to mature and broaden. And we actually have an approach from a marketing standpoint where the relationship management team that calls on an investor actually is calling with all KKR products in their bag and then they're supplemented by product specialists that can help go deeper on any individual fund our strategy. And so we think we're set up to be able to increase our cross-sell stats because you don't have that five KKR people be successful in one client. You need one to build trust and then to deliver the rest of the firm.
Bill Janetschek: And I think Glenn if you think the way works day to day so for our first 35 years, we probably only had a dialogue with a handful of people at a pension plan and that was very private equity focused. And if you think of our team now that dialogue will have expanded to the liquid credit professionals, the alternative credit professionals, within real assets, infrastructure, real estate, credit, equity, energy, et cetera. And at the same time, having a dialogue above that with the CIO as it relates to potential partnership opportunities. So, I think there's an aspect of that that actually as Scott said building like and trust. And that cross-sell focus is something that when it works, can happen very naturally.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. And I think the other thing that's it's hard to give you a number on this Glenn but I think is a positive bias. Back to the point I made about insurance and retail kind of four years ago roughly $17 billion of AUM now $60 billion. And we continue to invest in distribution in those areas and I think hopefully that's a positive bias to the numbers as well.
Glenn Schorr: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning guys. How are you?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, how are you doing?
Scott Nuttall: Terrific.
Patrick Davitt: Good. Just to double-check the $375 million you expect in the fourth quarter would that include kind of the normal pop in -- the normal 4Q pop in Public markets incentive fees?
Bill Janetschek: No. So that does not include incentive fees at all. What we're talking about is realized carry and realized balance sheet income. It has nothing to do with incentive fees.
Patrick Davitt: Awesome. Thanks. And then on the I guess flagship private equity LTM performance I think you highlighted Asia III as being a big driver of that. I guess could you kind of walk you through maybe some more specifics into what drove such a big move in that number from last quarter?
Scott Nuttall: Patrick it's really broad performance across the portfolio. But the -- I think the broad trends we're seeing within Asia continues. And again the experience with LPs continues to be one I think that's very positive and that number as a whole as it relates to Asia III specifically.
Bill Janetschek: And Patrick, one other thing to keep in mind when you're thinking about going from the second quarter to third quarter and that big pop when I was talking earlier about the $925 million to come either in the fourth quarter or the first quarter, three of those positions were strategic in Asia III. And so we've had them properly marked from a valuation point of view but we did a little better on each of those exits and that's what actually really drove the big increase in the IRR quarter-over-quarter.
Patrick Davitt: So, if the -- that 26% you're showing includes 4Q 2018, it's fair to assume that's probably going to come up pretty significantly again when that rolls off?
Bill Janetschek: No. So what happens from an IRR perspective Patrick is that as we got close those strategic sales happening that was embedded in the valuation that was done as of September 30. And so you actually saw some of the uplift in those positions in the third quarter. So on a mark-to-market basis a good amount, but not all of it is embedded in our valuation. That being said the monetization will take place in the fourth quarter and first quarter.
Patrick Davitt: Okay. I get that. I will follow-up later. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious your perspectives on purchase price multiples today on new transactions as we look across the industry. I think on average, we're seeing new deals at around 11 times EBITDA in terms of purchase price multiples, which is a little bit above where we were pre-crisis with some folks site as risker late cycle. But arguably the mix and growth profile are perhaps a little bit different today. So just curious your perspective looking on under the hood there on that for the industry and then also for KKR specifically.
Craig Larson: Yeah, Mike let me start there and then Scott or Bill may chime in. I think one of the things that's interesting to look at public equity deployment is look we continue to see more dislocation, more opportunity and better risk/reward outside of the U.S. And part of that is exactly what you're talking about which is valuation-related. So if you look at total returns over the last five years returns for S&P is more than 2 times that of the MSCI Asia Pacific. And so overall, we are seeing greater value overall in the region. And so if you look year-to-date in terms of investment activity again it's interesting but dollars invested in Asia together with Europe are actually over 2.5 times that of the U.S. And again I think what you're seeing is given overall valuation levels a pretty disciplined approach as it relates to U.S. investments most specifically.
Bill Janetschek: And just to give you a little more color on the $2.4 billion that we've invested this quarter in Private Markets only $400 million was in the U.S. And so to Craig's point a majority of the capital that we're deploying right now is certainly outside the U.S. And when you look into what's in the pipeline right now on transactions that are signed, but yet to close on the buy side again the amount in certainly U.S. private equity is more a component of the capital that we're deploying.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And just as a quick follow-up question maybe just on the comp ratio. Curious your latest thinking around that I think was around 40% in the quarter at a time when the realizations were a little bit higher off the balance sheet. So just curious given the 50% growth in management fees you're expecting over the next three years how would you expect the comp ratio to trend from here?
Bill Janetschek: Michael, this is Bill. I'll echo what Scott said earlier. As we continue to grow the platforms and as we continue to raise more capital and to the extent that those management fees go up you will see margin improvement. That being said, when you look at where we are in 2019 and probably the early part of 2020, we have a lot of R&D going through our P&L as we continue expand a lot of the platforms especially in Asia. So I would say that that 40% comp ratio that was reported in the third quarter is probably going to be close to that over certainly the next quarter couple of quarters. But again as we continue to grow our business there will certainly be operating improvement and you should see margin expansion.
Michael Cyprys: Thank you. 
Bill Janetschek: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris Harris: Thanks, guys. For the flagship funds to be launched over the coming 12 months, I just want to clarify does that mean when you expect to start the fundraising or when those funds could potentially go live?
Craig Larson: So, I think, we'll launch all three of those in the coming 12 months Chris. And then the question in terms of when they're going to be turned on is ultimately going to be a deployment question. And so we'll have the play it by ear. So I think in terms of your models as you think over the next 12 months to 18 months again knock on wood should be helpful from an AUM standpoint and then the fee-paying aspect will depend when those funds get turned on.
Scott Nuttall: But just to be clear Chris, I think, the expectation we shared with you before in terms of the trajectory for management fees incorporates when we expect them to turn on as opposed to when the dollars are raised. So it's when they hit revenue.
Bill Janetschek: And the one subtlety about those three large flagship funds that we're talking about the management fees get turned on based upon committed capital and not invested capital.
Chris Harris: Got it. Okay. And just a quick one on the quarter. What drove the upside to the guidance you previously gave on gross carry and realized investment income?
Bill Janetschek: Between the time, we actually sent out the press release which was probably a week before quarter end, we ended up having some activity that was unknown to us that we that week earlier. And so I would take that as nothing but good news.
Chris Harris: Got it. Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin Ryan: Great. Good morning everyone.
Bill Janetschek: Good morning.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Craig Larson: Hey, Devin.
Devin Ryan: Just a follow-up on some of the commentary on the distribution investments you're making. You spoke I guess to some of the specifics on the institutional side, but you alluded to and I guess referenced investments on the retail and high net worth effort. So I'm just curious, what's specifically incremental there? I guess reading between the lines it sounds like maybe there's some new initiatives that maybe haven't been launched yet. I'm just trying to think about what exactly that is and also expectations for fundraising in that channel.
Scott Nuttall: Devin, it's Scott. So great question. So there's two channels that we were referring to. One is the insurance market where we've seen a significant amount of growth and interest in what we're doing. And I'd say, if you back up even to a higher level for a second, given we have $17 trillion or $18 trillion of negative rates in the world, we are seeing a number of investors in all channels struggle with how to make money in this environment. So as we travel around the world and talk to a number of different types of investors, the basic theme is, it's very hard to make money in a negative rate world. We believe we need more alternatives in order to achieve our objectives. So I'd say before this dynamic and this more recent significant increase in negative rates, we had a lot of wind at our back. I would say the velocity of the wind at our back as an industry has only increased as a result of that dynamic. As part of that there's the institutional fees which we talked a lot about the historically. There's insurance which we really began to focus on really in earnest over the course of the last four or five years. And we're seeing significant early returns both in our regular way products, but also structured products that are packaged in a way that it's easier for insurance companies to invest in. So think about taking a portfolio of alternatives using structure and trying to figure out how to create investment-grade notes off the back of a portfolio. Those are the types of things that we're doing in the insurance space that we think is broadening the investor interest in what we're doing aided by that overall backdrop. So that $8 billion going to $26 billion in insurance the last four years is with just a few people in our firm focused on this space. So the point is, if we increase the staffing in that area and increase the global focus on the insurance base, we think there's significant upside for their regular way and structure. And in the retail and high net worth that's space is to give you a sense year-to-date 22% of the capital we've raised has been from the retail and high net worth market. And as we've been tracking that stat over the last several years, we've kind of steadily seen that statistic go up from about 10% in 2015 and now the last several quarters in excess of 20% of the money we're raising from retail and high net worth. That is across -- virtually everything you're going to see on the right-hand side of page 6 those individual product format and then in a lot of cases we're basically packaging several different types of strategies together and selling it to the high net worth and retail market. There again, we have a very small team internally, which we think with incremental investment in the size of that team that number of $35 billion in that channel which is up from $9 billion four years ago, we think that $35 billion could go up meaningfully from here. And a lot of it is just incremental staffing and incremental focus on this space. At the same time, we're finding investor interest in what we do on the increase.
Devin Ryan: Okay. Great color. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on your AUM today that's above cost, but not yet paying carry interest. I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you just give us an update of kind of where that stands and then how we should think about the trajectory of those assets contributing to carried interest longer term?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Devin this is Bill. We actually put it out in the supplement in the first quarter. That information is pretty much in line with where it was in the first quarter. So no new news. To the extent that we see an acceleration in that number we will certainly update you.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. The only thing I would add Devin is last summer we did an Investor Day. And Joe Bae and I put up a slide that kind of showed that we believe we're under earning our carry relative to our potential. And that slide shows we've been at about $1.3 billion give or take at that point of trailing 12 months carry, and we saw an opportunity for that to go to $2 billion or more over the next five-ish years. And so, we still think that is the case. Actually, we're more confident in that outlook today than we were last summer. And even more broadly at that event we put up numbers for book value per share and total distributable earnings out five years and 10 years. So the chart in there that actually lays out that outlook for the firm with what we thought we're pretty conservative assumptions at that time. And there again, I'd tell you that we're more confident in being able to exceed that outlook today than we were even at that date last summer.
Bill Janetschek: And just very specifically on page 13, when you take a look at the investment table, right now we've got carry interest eligible mandates of approximately $130 billion. That's actually up from the $123 billion that we reported in the first quarter. And again just to give you a reference, the number in the first quarter was about $88 billion, so $88 billion of the $123 billion was eligible to start receiving carry. And so, like I said that number is certainly a little north of that. But, certainly with more capital being raised, we expect that number to go up based upon obviously performance still being there.
Devin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate it guys.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just -- most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just a follow-up on the insurance side. Just in terms of that growth dynamic -- and thanks Scott for the comment on sort of the efforts there. Do you expect that to be more of a blocking and tackling type of the increase in penetration? Or is it possible you might have some strategic agreements that could really step that insurance penetration up dramatically in the next couple of years?
Scott Nuttall: We're pursuing both Brian, I'd say definitely on the blocking and tackling. And a number of the relationships that we developed in the insurance space, I would put more in the strategic partnership category where they're now investing with us across multiple of different products in scale. And our cross-sell statistics across the insurance base are actually better than the firm as a whole despite the use of our -- relative use of our effort in the insurance space. So, I think it's definitely blocking and tackling. And we have done some things quietly on the strategic front, that is also supplying the firm with AUM and we continue to spend time looking at doing more of those. And some of them maybe modest but we're looking at some bigger moves as well. Far too early to be able to predict if anything happens, but I think you should expect both blocking and tackling and strategic efforts on the front.
Brian Bedell: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a clarification on the $375 million and the $925 million, that includes the Fiserv margin loan in 4Q and then into 1Q? And is that roughly expected to be nearly the same level as it was in 3Q?
Bill Janetschek: Not going to really comment on very specific granular numbers on that, other than to say that there will be an additional distribution made to our LPs in order to return capital to them. And the offshoot to that is more carry being paid to the firm as well as some balance sheet realizations.
Scott Nuttall: I'd say those numbers include what we expect to do on the margin loan over the next few quarters.
Brian Bedell: Did you? Okay. Great. Yeah. All right. Great. Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Craig Larson for closing comments.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Norma. Thank you everybody for joining our call. Please feel free of course to follow-up directly with any follow-ups, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead, sir.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Michelle. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call, thanks for joining us. As usual, I’m joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We’d like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at KKR.com. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements, and like previous quarters, we’ve posted a supplementary – a supplementary presentation on our website that we’ll be referring to over the course of the call. And I’m going to begin by referencing Pages 2 and 3 of the deck. So Page 2 shows the summary of our four key metrics. The strength of our underlying fundamentals are evident in the trends that you see on the page. Perhaps most importantly the earnings power of the firm continues to grow nicely as can be seen by the charts on the left hand side. Our AUM is now at $206 billion and book value per share is $17.81. Spending a minute on book value, we’ve seen attractive returns really across asset classes in this performance combined with the power of compounding has driven the 14% year-over-year increase in our book value per share. This 14% figure compares favorably to broad market indices like the MSCI World, which is up 7% over this timeframe. As well as fixed income indices like the LSTA that’s up about 4% over the last 12 months. Highlighting the strong performance, we’ve seen unrealized carried interest, one of the key components of our book is up 21% since last quarter and it’s increased 45% since the beginning of the year. Looking at the right-hand side of the page alongside of this management fees have grown steadily and distributable earnings on an LTM basis have increased 12%. Turning to Page 3, you’ll see some additional details. We reported after-tax distributable earnings of $327 million for the quarter or $0.39 on a per adjusted share basis. And as a reminder, as you look at these figures, we do report our distributable earnings after taking into account equity based charges. Management fees for the quarter came in at $303 million, up 16% compared to Q2, 2018 and 17% comparing the year-over-year LTM periods. Fee related earnings for the quarter are $287 million and on an LTM basis, our $1.1 billion, this is a record fee related earnings figure for us on a trailing 12 month basis of 28% compared to the LTM figure as of a year ago. Now, as we reviewed historically there are five things we need to do well as we evaluate our performance. We need to generate investment performance, we need to raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments and use our model to capture more economics from everything that we do. I’m going to update you on the progress on the first two and Bill is going to cover the remaining three. In terms of our investment performance, please take a look at Page 4 of the deck, which shows the trailing 12-month performance across our flagship funds. In private equity, our three flagship funds appreciated 12% on a blended basis and the private equity portfolio as a whole appreciated 15%, both of these figures compare favorably to the 7% total return of the MSCI World, I mentioned a minute ago. Our real asset strategies are performing as well with our more mature, real estate and infrastructure flagship funds up 7% and 13%, while our flagship energy fund is flat over the last 12 months compared to a 36% decline in S&P’s Oil and Gas E&P Select Index. And in credit, our composite performance compares favorably relative to the LSTA and the HFRX special sits indices, which are plus 4% and minus 8.7% respectively over the last 12 months. In terms of fundraising, we raised $6.5 billion of new capital in the quarter. We held an initial close in our new Asia real estate strategy. We price new CLOs in the U.S. and Europe and had inflows in the leverage credit SMAs as well as various alternative credit products. Additionally, we progressed in our goal of raising long duration capital. As of quarter end, we now have $43 billion in permanent and strategic capital there has either recycling or a very long expected life of 15-plus years or more at inception. In total inflows in the quarter contributed to $56 billion of dry powder at quarter end and included in this is $18 billion of capital commitments that become fee-paying on an as-invested basis at a weighted average rate of just over 100 basis points. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Bill.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. I’ll start with the third thing we need to do well, which is find new investment opportunities. We invested $5.8 billion across businesses and geographies in the second quarter. Public markets deployment was $1.8 billion, coming primarily from our private credit and direct lending strategies. On the private market side, we invested $4 billion. The largest contributors for our newest core investment coming out of Europe and in Middle Eastern – Midstream investment from our infrastructure fund. Other notable investments were a handful of Asia private equity investments and a European private equity investment. Shifting to monetization activity, we completed a number of secondaries including our final exit from higher. We also completed multiple strategic sales that positively impacted both our fund and the balance sheet. On a blended basis, the PE exits were down at four times our cost. For the quarter, it was $358 million of gross total realized carried interest and total realized investment income. This compares to $600 million that as we stand here today has closed or has been signed and is expected to close in 2019 or 2020 of which at this point, we expect $250 million to close in Q3, and it’s only in the end of July. And finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM capital markets and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. Focusing first on capital markets KCM had a strong quarter with $158 million of transaction fees. The market environment in Q2 is certainly improved compared to Q1 of this year. Performance in this quarter, highlighted the geographic breadth of the business as capital markets revenues added in Asia and Europe, both outpace revenues in North America. And if you turn to Page 5 of the supplement, I’m going to spend a minute on our core investing strategy as we’ve seen core begin to impact our balance sheet investment performance, and our book value compounding. We introduced the core strategy on this call two years ago with a focus on investments that have a lower target to return profile in private equity, but a solid businesses and we want to own for 10 plus years. We chose to commit significant balance sheet capital alongside a handful of partners. We currently have $10.5 billion of AUM focused on this strategy, including $3.5 billion we’ve committed of our own capital. Now two years in, looking at L.P. Capital together with balance sheet capital we’ve invested a total of $4 billion through transactions across the U.S., Europe and Asia with a gross IRR of 21% and in terms of the investment line on the segment balance sheet, Core as a fair value of $1.9 billion as of quarter end. Keep in mind, the 21% IRR has not run through our total distributor earnings yet, that is all unrealized gain. However, Core is contributed approximately $425 million of balance sheet value since we began investing in this strategy we feel we’re off to a good start and we’ll keep you posted along the way. There are two other point I’d like to make in relation to the balance sheet. The first thing I want to point out is you’ll see BridgeBio, a biopharma investment is now our third largest balance sheet holdings. Following its Q2 IPO and strong trading – post IPO, fair value as of June 30 was $395 million and its market five times our cost. Given its significance we wanted to provide that additional color. The second thing I’d like to call out related to our debt obligations. We recently priced two bond offerings, a euro denominated offering and a U.S. dollar denominated refinancing of the 2020 maturity both at attractive rates. Putting aside any premium associated with taking out the 2020 notes, we will have added approximately $725 million of liquidity to the balance sheet, with effectively no increase in interest expense. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill and thanks everybody for joining our call. I’m going to focus today on how we’ve been scaling and how we think about the trajectory for our business from here. I mentioned on our last call that despite our 43-year history, we’re young firm. 18 of our 22 strategies were launched in the last decade, and in our business it takes about a decade to start to achieve scale. So we have a lot of growth ahead of us as we go from fund one or two to fund three, four and five across the majority of the firm’s investing activities. We think that upside is dramatic, but for us this growth opportunity is compounded by the fact that while we’ve been launching new investing businesses. We’ve also been making large investments in distribution. We relate to building out our distribution efforts. Remember, 10 years ago, we had about a dozen people on our fundraising team and 275 investors. We now have 90 people on the team and nearly 1,000 investors, but we still have a long way to go. Our investors count has been growing and our cross-sell stats have been improving, but we still see an opportunity to meaningfully expand both of those numbers. As a result, going forward, we expect to see our AUM compound significantly from the powerful combination of more mature track records and a growing investor base. Page 6 of the deck, give you a good sense of what’s been happening on this front over the last seven years. We report in our press release, the gross new capital raised every quarter. That number can be lumpy, given the timing of closings and when our funds come to market. Especially, the larger funds. To give a better sense for what we are experiencing this chart looks at the new capital raised and acquired on a trailing three-year basis. You can see from the chart that despite the use of many of our strategies and relationship the trailing three year number has grown from $18 billion in 2012 and $95 billion today. And with acquisitions, the number is over $100 billion. As you can see from the chart, PE has grown from about $8 billion to $20 billion to $30 billion as our three regional PE funds have scaled. What’s more dramatic however is our non-PE fund, which on this trailing three-year basis have gone from $9 billion of capital raised to $73 billion. As you look at this chart and think about these numbers please keep in mind, what I said. This has all happened with a lot of fund ones and a lot of new relationships. So while we’re pleased with the progress we’ve made, we feel like the last 10 years of building track records in relationships position us to really scale from here. We see growth from creating new investment platforms scaling our existing platforms with existing relationships and doing more with those existing investors. And we see even more upside from creating new relationships across channels and around the world. And on top of these points, it’s important to recognize that in the next six to 18 months we’ll be in the market for our largest three funds. Asia PE, Americas PE and infrastructure. So the long-term opportunity is large and the near-term visibility is high. Thank you for joining our call. We’re happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Craig Larson: And Michelle we’d like to ask everyone if they wouldn’t mind to please ask one question and then one follow-up if necessary to just allow us to work our way through the queue. Thank you.
Operator: And our first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe the first question. Scott, you mentioned sort of the fundraising outlook focus on distribution, some of the opportunities there. I guess, just given the pace of deployment and then the performance relative to, whether it’s the peers or the benchmarks. How should we be thinking about it, I think we have a pretty good view maybe over the – in the second half in terms of what’s out there, but if you’re thinking about 2020 and 2021, both on the distribution with the flagships like how meaningful can it be over that timeline.
Scott Nuttall: Craig, why don’t you kick in off and talk about what we see coming to market over the next couple of years and then I’ll give some color.
Craig Larson: Yes, sure. So Mike in terms of where we’re fundraising currently. Why do we start there, that would include fundraising for a number of European strategies. So that’s private equity opportunistic real estate and direct lending. In Asia, we’re fundraising for strategies outside of private equity within, including infrastructure and real estate, and we’re also fundraising across our impact, real estate credit, special situations and our next generation technology growth strategy. And at the same time we have areas where we look to raise capital on a more continuous basis that includes the CLO business, leverage credit platforms in the U.S. and Europe as well as our BDC and hedge fund partnerships.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. So I’d say, it just as an overlay, Michael, I’d say that the opportunity to scale from here, we think is dramatic. We mentioned the three large funds coming to market in the next six to 18 months because those do tend to be a little bit more sizable when they do come, but as you can, you tell from the chart on Page 6 of the deck. It’s much more than just the larger episodic funds coming to market, it’s showing up in the numbers. And so the way we look at it is we have for these 18 other businesses of the 22 that were in, that – they are starting to work their way through kind of the fund one, fund two dynamic and as we’ve talked about in the past we think successor funds can be multiples of the prior. And we just happen to have that in a lot of different places across the firm. And so it’s the – the opportunity to scale is something that we are quite optimistic about and at the same time, the reason we mentioned that we have been building out distribution as we see opportunity everywhere, more institutional relationship, insurance retail, high net worth, structured products we begin – we believe we’re just scratching the surface and there is a lot of incremental relationships we can create and a lot of relationships we can build from a good start. So, a long way of saying we see a lot of upside and this chart has been created during a period of time where we’re just creating a lot of things.
Michael Carrier: All right, that’s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, you guys talk about ROE as a metric, just given the balance sheet, but you mentioned Core on this call and the growth in that area. When you think about, like how that impacts the balance sheet, meaning the mark-to-market more immediately versus say the benefits on the realizations flowing through the EBITDA can take years for that to play out. Like, how do you think about that in especially relative to ROE in that being a metric.
Bill Janetschek: Yes, Mike. Thanks for asking about it – it’s actually a very good question precisely for the reason you mentioned and Core is a great example of this dynamic. So as we look at our ROE and we evaluate our performance. We do look at ROE on a marks basis, in order to really focus on total value creation, and I think to us that aspect is critical. So for the numerator, we look at the change in book value over the last 12 months, and as you know we mark-to-market invest – in our book. And we’ll add the dividend to that to really look at the total value that has been created, whether that’s paid out in the dividend or retain on the balance sheet and we’ll look at that versus the average book over that period. So if you do that over the last 12 months, you’d get 16.5% and I think as we think about, and in after-tax ROE 16.5% with really low net leverage as a firm is very attractive versus broad financials. So that’s how we focus on ROE and again, I think most importantly reflecting mark-to-market in the numerator and the denominator is a critical piece of that.
Michael Carrier: Okay, thanks a lot.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks, good morning.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Craig Siegenthaler: Last quarter you had a slide that provided us an update on the KKR shareholder base following the C-Corp conversion and I didn’t see at this quarter, but I’m wondering if you had any fresh data points that you can share with us in terms of how your investor base has evolved over the last three months?
Craig Larson: Craig, thanks for asking about. The answer is actually a good one. So thinking back to what we had last quarter. If I could – have you jot down three numbers and then let me walk through what it represent. So the three numbers are $177 million, $291 million and then $332 million. So as you pointed out last quarter within the supplement we had a slide that highlighted the evolution in our shareholder base since conversion and what it – it showed most significantly was an increase in the mutual fund, the index fund and the other institutional components. So if you were to go back and look at that slide as of year-end 2017. So pre-conversion that group combined to own $177 million units that first number and as of year-end 2018. So post conversion that group combined to own $291 million so over 2018 we saw an increase of 114 million shares. Looking at that, that part of our shareholder base. So to help put some numbers around that update, as of March 31, that group owned 332 million shares. So in that three-month period, we saw an increase of $41 million or about 14% with increases across all three categories. And the other statistics that we look at is a number of institutions that file 13-F [ph] gives a sense of breadth. So we saw a double-digit percentage increase in the institutions that file 13-F, was a 12% increase. And when you look at again just over that time period. So we’ve seen a continued improvement across all these statistics as you probably get a sense, we follow them pretty – pretty closely to update the progress and I think two other final thoughts. One, when we look at the stats as best as we can against other large financials and C-Corp’s both those that are inside the S&P 500 and outside. It looks like, we still have a lot of room to grow. So, I think we’ve seen continued progress, which is great, but importantly, still feels like there is – like there is a lot to do.
Craig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt: Hey guys, good morning.
Craig Larson: Good morning.
Patrick Davitt: On the Capital Markets’ revenue. I think it came in a lot better than anyone was expecting given the lack of kind of large visible deal. Could you walk through maybe any of the key drivers of the increase in syndicated capital and the surgeon revenue there?
Bill Janetschek: Sure, Patrick. This is Bill, and remember, when we mentioned the number in the first quarter which was only about $6 million. We said that, Capital Markets was "shut" for probably half of the quarter. Capital Markets is rebounding and we saw a nice activity in the second quarter. The interesting thing this quarter and that’s why I highlighted in prepared remarks is, we’ve always talked about the geographic breadth and this quarter, the fees generated from Europe and for major were actually in excess of the fee generation from the U.S. And so that is positive as far as the geographic expansion that we talked about, but more importantly from a revenue point of view, we have KKR portfolio companies, plus we also have our third party business. And when you look at the activity during the quarter, about 70% of the revenue we generated from debt issuing fees and about 30% from the equity issuances. And the mandates, we’re in excess of 35%, so that means this came from over 35% separate and distinct clients that actually use KKR and Capital Markets in their business. And lastly, when you think about those verified mandates there were only two mandates that were in excess of $20 million, and so again, this is again in the broad breadth of the activity in Capital Markets this quarter.
Patrick Davitt: And would you give the percent [ph] that was third-party?
Bill Janetschek: I did not, but this quarter, it was roughly about 15%.
Patrick Davitt: 15%. Okay, thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Yes.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gerald O’Hara of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Q - Gerald O: Great, thanks. Bill maybe staying with you for a minute, just kind of looking at the income taxes in the quarter, and thinking about how to kind of model that going forward. Is this a reasonable run rate to start to begin that sort of linear increase over the next several years. I know you kind of given a – given some guidance previously in a state increase to sort of the low 2020s and 2023. Any kind of change and how that progression might play out or should we still kind of think about it as somewhat linear in nature.
Hara: Great, thanks. Bill maybe staying with you for a minute, just kind of looking at the income taxes in the quarter, and thinking about how to kind of model that going forward. Is this a reasonable run rate to start to begin that sort of linear increase over the next several years. I know you kind of given a – given some guidance previously in a state increase to sort of the low 2020s and 2023. Any kind of change and how that progression might play out or should we still kind of think about it as somewhat linear in nature.
Bill Janetschek: Gerald as you know, we talk about this every single quarter since we actually did convert to C-Corp and trying to give you better guidance as to how to model this, but what we did say was that when we dig out C-Corp, about half of the step-up was towards goodwill and we’d be amortized over 15 years, and so that’s pretty linear and that could be model. The other 50% we’ve actually tied to specific assets or specific funds and carry and as we saw those investments we will get the benefit of that shelter of tax. What’s happened in this quarter and still we’re talking about second quarter 2019, if there were a couple of investments, which weren’t written up much as of June 30, 2018 when we did go C-Corp. A lot of the appreciation occurred after that time and so when those investments were monetize, we didn’t have any shelter as far as against that income. That being said, we still have a heavily decent amount of shelter to provide few investments that when we went C-Corp had a lower cost than value. And so we were able to allocate to those investments. As those investments are sold, we’ll get the benefit of that tax reduction. But as I mentioned a year ago, it is very hard to predict, we – to try to keep things simple, said that it was going through roughly go up a few percentage points every single year on a walk from roughly 9%, up to the 22% and so long-winded way of telling you that, it – it’s pretty hard to model. I’ve written the hard wire a 15% rate, which is the rate this quarter. Next quarter, it could be depending on the mix of assets to be 11% or it could very well be that of all the assets that are sold in the third quarter, were written up at all when we went C-Corp, the tax rate on that will be 22%.
Gerald O’Hara: Okay, thanks for the – thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citi. Your line is open.
Bill Katz: Okay, thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. And I certainly appreciate page 6 of the supplement is very, very helpful. It’s a big picture question as you continue to scale your business and diversify. Can you talk a little bit maybe the dividend policy and how important does the book value strategy remain?
Craig Larson: I’d say the book value compounding remains a critical priority and focus for us, Bill. As we talked about in the past, in particular, we got into – in good detail when we changed our distribution policy several years ago, we’re big believers in the power of long-term compounding and if you flip back to page 2 of the deck and look at the bottom left-hand side, you can see over the last few years, instead of distribution policy was changed, we’ve started to see meaningful compounding in our book from $12 or so, to the better part of 2018 in a relatively shorter period of time. So, book value compounding continues to be a big part of our story as does AUM compounding and fee related earnings compounding. So, we’re focused on all of the above. Dividend policy is something that we’ll revisit on an annual basis, but we’re going to continue to invest in our own growth, and bet our – bet on ourselves, and that will show up in our book value per share. So, I think you should expect or else equal to have the dividend policy, move up the dividend over time. So, we do expect it to grow but we will largely be focused on compounding book as we compound the rest of our metrics.
Bill Katz: Okay. And a bit more of a tactical question, just coming back to the FRE drivers sequentially, just given the very strong activity on the transaction line. Is it a way to think about the incremental impact of that activity on FRE?
Scott Nuttall: Well, Bill, when you – when you focus on their transaction fees, you have to break it down between KCM and KKR proper. As you know in private markets, you see transaction fees and they were quite robust, but there also was a big increase in fee credits, because remember on the private market side, we have a sharing arrangement with our L.P.’s and roughly speaking, that’s 80% to the L.P.’s and 20% to us. So, if you see a transaction fee go up on the private market side, that’s good news, but the fee credit is going to be adjusted in the economics to us or roughly be about that 20%. Again, to believe with the point, if you go back to the Capital Markets, any sort of transaction fee we reported there is going to be 100%. Interestingly though, you still are pretty robust activity in the second quarter compared to the first, and if you take the transaction monitoring fees and netted against fee credit, you actually saw an increase of roughly about $23 million. And keep in mind, if you look at the capital investment line, we went from investing $3.3 billion to almost $4 billion and so you should expect that, that transaction fee would be higher this quarter.
Bill Katz: Okay. I’m just trying to get toward the incremental FRE contribution, but we can follow up offline. Okay, thank you very much for taking the question, Scott.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Hey, good morning everyone, thanks. Scott, to follow up to your discussion around scaling the business and the fact that maybe, you guys are related to some of the distribution initiatives, but maybe, have been sort of been catching up over the last couple of years as you look out, and especially, as we look at the flagship funds that are on the horizon here. How should we think about the company being in that 40%-ish range for now? How much flexibility you guys have to bring it down over the next couple of years?
Scott Nuttall: So, I think the guidance we’ve given you is that we expect the comp ratio to be in the low-40s. Alex, I think that’s what we suggest, it’s still the right assumption to use. As we scale our businesses and in particular, as we see carried interest we generated from a number of these fund ones and twos that have been invested, but not yet realized and as our AUM and fees continue to scale from all the good work that teams have been doing in terms of creating a very attractive track records. We would have more flexibility over time to potentially bring that down, but in the next couple of years. I wouldn’t guide you any differently than the low-40s.
Alex Blostein: Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up, Bill to your kind of state of the Union sort of update on where realize incentive income investment stand for the next kind of couple of quarters, so that $600 million number. I just want to make sure, does that contemplate any disposition of first Data FIS or kind of the related transaction there or any of your other public holdings.
Bill Janetschek: Good question. To be clear, it does not contemplate any secondaries. So, these are transactions that have closed our strategic sales that have been signed and it’s yet to close. And the reference was it the $250 million, which we expect in the third quarter and the headline number was $600 million, that’s because there are a couple of strategic sales have taken place. We had a signed documentation and we expect those to close in the early part of 2020.
Alex Blostein: Great, thanks so much.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks very much. See what I can get at this one. We hear all the growth is scaling and the distribution we’ll get it and it’s working great. If you look at the proposal out of Elizabeth Warren recently, it would suggest something other than we all – we all believe is taking place. So I guess I’m – I’d love to give you a shot to either A, response and/or B, talk about how the business would adapt if some of those proposals are put in place.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Glenn for the question. Always appreciate being given an opportunity, not going to take you up on it today.
Glenn Schorr: Okay, no problem.
Scott Nuttall: We’re not – we’re not going to comment. I think, we’re obviously at the beginning of, probably a season of a number of different things that will be in the medias will – we’ll watch it as will you and we’ll let you know as how things developed, if and how it impacts our business. I would tell you that we have been focused for the last decade plus on making sure that we have a robust effort around all things ESG and making sure that we’re being thoughtful about all the stakeholders to whom we’re responsible. And so we’ll continue to focus on that endeavor and then adjust as the environment adjusts.
Glenn Schorr: Okay. And maybe, a business related to one. This seems to be a rising public to private trends. Curious if you’re seeing that the same degree I am, if it’s just a function of differential in valuations and I think of it as a seasonal thing.
Scott Nuttall: We’re seeing it too. And I think it is providing opportunities to us. I think the market, Glenn; it’s become a bit of a have/have not market. And I think if a company has real growth, there is in certain sectors and is a really simple story. They tend to get a high multiple and as a lot of capital goes that direction, if there is some complexity if, it’s lower growth; if there is more explaining needs to be done. There’s a lot of companies that get left behind. And so we are seeing this bifurcated market develop and I do think that is leading to more interest on the part of management teams to consider going private transactions. So that’s clearly creating the opportunities for us. I’d say the market’s focus on simple stories is also creating opportunities and so far, as a lot – a number of companies are selling non-core subsidiaries. And we’ve been particularly active around corporate carveouts all around the world. And I think that’s a derivative of this public to private trend, it’s more of a simplified trend that we’re benefiting from, but we’re seeing the same thing you are.
Glenn Schorr: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Chris Kotowski: Yes. good morning and thanks. The – I noticed the carried interest receivable is up 21% linked quarter and that just seems like a big number and kind of a ho-hum market. Is there any particular story behind that?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Chris. This is Bill. No particularly story other than we manage a lot of capital and the appreciation was quite robust during the quarter, for example, private equity or private equity portfolio is up 6.4%. So, demand is a lot of capital and you see that appreciation, you’ll see that come through in the accrued carry number.
Scott Nuttall: And the only thing I’d add Chris, it’s also coming from non-PE and we mentioned in the number of these younger funds are now getting invested. The dollars in the ground are growing and the accrued carry is starting to tick up for non-PE as well. And we’ve shared that we think there is significant upside to our carried interest line over time is that continues to play out and those investments are exited. So, all else equal, we hope to see that, that accrued carry from non-PE continue to grow.
Bill Janetschek: Right. And to that point, we actually – we actually had a slide in the supplemental deck last quarter and of the $123 billion of eligible carry that we – carry eligible funds that we manage that number was $88 billion. So again, to Scott’s point, as we continue to grow the business, not only in PE, but continue to add different mandates and they work their way through their preferred returns and then our carry eligible, you’re going to see that number go up.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. And then as a follow-up, is BridgeBio also in the healthcare growth fund or is it just a balance sheet investment?
Bill Janetschek: Good question. And it’s not a straightforward answer. The answer is that it was originally on our balance sheet, again, the beauty of our balance sheet is we have the ability to use some of their balance sheet capital to prove contact and then we go raise capital with a third-party mandate attached. BridgeBio we invested over four separate tranches, the first two were made specifically just on the balance sheet. And then as we raised a fund and that fund was eligible to participate in that investment with – the fund participated. So that $395 million is balance sheet capital plus a flavor [ph] of the GP interest in a healthcare growth on. But more importantly, you’ve got the $395 million of value, but it’s only $75 million of cost and we made that investment over the last two and a half years.
Chris Kotowski: Well, I guess what I was also wondering about is obviously, it’s nice – it would be nice to have a five banger in the – in your first time biotech. So, I mean it’s – I mean is that – did that – it does help boost the performance of the fund by a similar amount as to what we see on your balance sheet.
Bill Janetschek: And it certainly has and that’s a very good, very good point. And when you take into account, we’re just talking about the $395 million, which is our investment on our balance sheet. Embedded in there is also some accrued carry, because of the healthcare growth fund – because of the IRR that it has, right now. Healthcare growth fund is right now. Remember, it’s an early funding, we had some big write-up, so is – the gross IRR is, I think over a 100%. And so you’re going to see that big bang that you talk about.
Chris Kotowski: Okay, all right. thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin Ryan: Okay, great. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe, just one here for Scott, you had mentioned a lot of visibility into the business near-term, and you had given some longer-term perspective on fee related earnings and the trajectory at the Investor Day. but since then we’ve got some pretty specific FRE guidance for the next few years from some of your peers just given this transparency, which I think it has been helpful to the market. And so if possible, is it possible to give us anything more granular on where you see fee related earnings, maybe over the next two to three years or range of growth rates from here just based on that level of visibility you have into the business and some of the moving parts like fund-raising or deployment?
Scott Nuttall: Great question, Devin. And I appreciate this opportunity as well, but also not going to take you up on it. I think we’re not comfortable giving FRE guidance per se. I think what we are comfortable doing is just sharing with you the trends that we’re seeing in the business. And as you can tell from the narrative and the significant growth we’ve had in management fees, 16% give or take plus the opportunities we see to continue to scale our Capital Markets businesses. We’ll share with you what we’re seeing, but we do see meaningful upside and the opportunity to create operating leverage as well. but there’s no specific guidance. but with that, I’d tell you the overall sentiment here is we’ve put in a lot of hard work in the last decade. Getting ourselves to this point in terms of creating track records and new relationships and if we can create page six with fund ones and new relationships, we’re kind of in a mode of being very optimistic around what we can do as we scale from this point forward. So upbeat, but no specifics for you.
Bill Janetschek: And just to give you a little bit of color, very short-term, remember when you take a look at fee-paying AUM year-over-year, it’s up 9% and we have talked about shadow fee-paying AUM that number is roughly $18 billion and over 100 basis points of the income attached to that – to that as that capital was invested over the next couple of years, you’re certainly going to be able to see management fees increased, because of that.
Devin Ryan: Yes, okay. Bill, thanks for that and give it a shot, but I appreciate it guys.
Bill Janetschek: I’ll just try.
Devin Ryan: Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris Harris: So, there is a lot of negative yielding debt in Europe as you guys know. How is this impacting your business or your approach to investing in that region if at all?
Scott Nuttall: Oh, it’s a great question. And it’s – what we’re finding in Europe is that the opportunity in the private markets and the opportunity to generate return from capturing the illiquidity premium Chris, it’s significant. And so it’s not impacting our investment approach per se, but we are finding that when we talk to investors around the world, especially those in Europe are with big European components of their portfolio. So, they are looking to do more with us, because they are focused on figuring out how to capture that illiquidity premium for them. So, it hasn’t really changed how we’re investing per se, but what it has done is it allowed us to create a series of discussions with investors that are trying to figure out how to position their portfolio on a negative yielding environment. So, we’re seeing more flows into things like private credit infrastructure, real estate and anything that has a yield coming from the illiquidity private markets. We’re finding a lot of interest.
Chris Harris: Got it. Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the newer product initiatives that you’re introducing targeted toward insurance companies and in particular, I saw you recently had a return enhanced structured note that I think invest across a number of your strategies, but pays a fixed distribution. So, I guess what sort of market opportunities do you see for these sort of innovative solutions and how are you able to structure such a high coupon that pays out on the sort of structured note? Are you evolving the return streams and payouts on your private equity funds to match if you could just help us understand that? Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Michael. Yes, I think this kind of – this question brings together a few different themes we’ve covered in the past. One is that we’re focused on how we can continue to raise capital that is longer duration. As you know, we’re focused on kind of generating more permanent capital and recycling long-term 15-plus year block of type capital. And so that’s one thing we’ve been very focused on. Another thing, we’ve been very focused on is building our relationships out in the insurance space. And over the course of the last four or so years, we’ve seen our AUM from insurance companies go from $8 billion to north of $25 billion and as we’ve been spending time across those two themes, we have found an opportunity in a number of different respects to innovate to create products that achieve both objectives, raise longer-term capital for us to invest in compound for our partners and do it in a format that is attractive for insurers and easier for them to invest in. And so the product that you’re talking about is just one example of many that we have been working on and a number of them have actually been completed. The answer to your higher level question around how can you generate yield on a Private Markets portfolio is relatively straightforward. If you think about what we do, private equity and growth equity, it’s true traditionally do not generate much current return but if you think about it, whereas basically everything else we’re doing does private credit infrastructure, real estate equity, real estate credit, energy are just some examples. And so we’re finding that you can create a more diversified portfolio of alternatives that does have recurring yield. And I think it’s a combination of that recurring yield plus upside of private and growth equity and other asset classes that we think it’s an opportunity to create hybrid products that are attractive, both on the run and then also in terms of long-term upside.
Michael Cyprys: Great. thanks. I’ll get back in the queue to ask follow-up.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. And I apologize if this – you maybe went over this, because I got on the call a little bit late, but just going back to kind of capital management and the dividend, I mean, not a year anniversary since one converted, reset the dividends. So, how should we think about your view about dividend growth from here? Since we’re kind of a year in at this point and second question is it really relates kind of more to comp ratio and the carry pool, I guess you – I think you guys are somewhat unique and that you pay everyone pretty much out of one big carry pool, I believe, as opposed to point on those specific funds. but as you get bigger as you have many more strategy is that a model that other becomes easier to execute on, or is there, the pressure to change it, is kind of the firm becomes more diverse?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Rob, this is Bill. We did cover both these points earlier on, but – so the punch line is, is it relates to the change in dividend policy. It’s nothing that we’ll address annually and it’s probably something what we will be discussed on the fourth quarter call. As it relates to that one comp full what we mentioned earlier, is that we’re talking that comparable to be in the low-40s and remember we pay every one-off of one P&L, and we don’t break down specifically, how that – how that income is generated whether or not it’s fee income over then on carry to the balance sheet earnings, we look at everything more holistically. but you’ve got to believe that as we continue to scale our business and grow that business, you should see over time, margin improvement, but that’s not going to happen next quarter per se. And so when we went to the C-Corp conversion and we only reported one comp number, we said that we were going to target that number in the low-40s to make sure that the operating margins would be roughly about 50%. And so there is not going to be any change anytime soon.
Scott Nuttall: And I think on the last part of your question Rob, the pressure to change it. no, we don’t see any pressure to change that. This has been a part of how the KKR is operated from inception that everybody is always participated in the global carry pool. It’s a critical part of our culture and allows us to make sure we connect the dots across the firm and everybody works together and so we expect that to continue to be the case.
Robert Lee: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: One on lending, just how you’re seeing that used across the industry today in terms of order of magnitude and size, and to what extent does KKR use capital call lending when you’re making deployments, delaying capital costs using leverage and then drawing down on that?
Scott Nuttall: Mike, you actually just cut in halfway through your question. Would you mind just repeating it and we didn’t catch, you were silent for the first part.
Michael Cyprys: Sure. I was just asking about capital call line lending. So, when you’re buying an asset in a fund using leverage initially to buy and then drawing down on the line to, and then repaying it off in the future. Just curious, what you’re seeing across the industry in terms of usage of this form of leverage. What sort of magnitude in size do you see for this that part of the industry and to what extent is KKR using this form of leverage?
Bill Janetschek: Hey Michael, this is Bill. I’ll take that one. When you think about the administrative eased by having a subscription facility in each one of the funds. We’ve been doing that for the past few years. And so that line is not as built in much at all. It’s again, more for administrative ease as opposed to anything. As it relates, maybe, to a question that you might be asking as far as to the extent that you use a facility, do you actually increase the return profile on that particular fund, because of the delay draw, but I would just want to let you know that as we report to our L.P.’s, we report the IRR, because of us having the ability to use that subscription line, but we also report a return as if we didn’t use the subscription line. So, we actually have these transparency reports, where again, we report for both of those numbers.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And what would be the typical duration of a draw on that?
Bill Janetschek: Typically, on average, we have this facility, we’ve drawn this facility and it usually gets paid down every six months.
Michael Cyprys: Got it, okay. So, six months. thanks so much.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: You’re welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for any closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Michelle, thanks for your help and thank you everybody for joining our call. please of course, follow up directly with anything else and we look forward to chatting next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead, sir.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Justin. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call, thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at ww.kkr.com. The call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, and please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. And I am going to being by referring referencing pages 2 & 3 of the supplementary deck. Page 2 shows the summary our four key metrics and the strength of our underlying fundamentals is evident in our results and the trends that you see on this page. Perhaps most importantly the earnings power the firm continues to grow nicely as can be - as can be seen by the charts on the left hand side. Our AUM is now at $200 billion and book value of $16.99 per share has increased 17% over the last 12 months. Alongside of this, you see the management fees have grown steadily and on an LCM basis our distributable earnings have increased 29% compared to a year ago. Page 3 shows our results with just a little more granularity; We've reported after-tax distributable earnings of $314 million for the quarter or $0.38 on a per adjusted share basis and please remember that we report our distributable earnings after equity based compensation charges. Fee related earnings for the quarter were $222 million and fee paying AUM on a year-over-year basis has increased 23% to $148 billion reflecting our Europe V funds entering its investment period. And finally looking at these metrics on a trailing 12-month basis, you see strong growth across the page with LTM year-over-year growth ranging between 13% and 29%. Now before I turn things over to Bill to talk about our results, I'm going to spend a few minutes on our ownership profile and the transformation we've begun to see in our shareholder base since we changed our corporate structure. As you likely remember as a partnership, we concluded that our stock had become challenging to buy and challenging to own, so on this call a year ago we announced a series of changes. Most significantly to make the stock easy to buy we converted from a partnership to a corporation and this was effective on July 1st of last year. As a corporation we became eligible for more ETS and indices and broadening opportunity for us to appeal to longer-term oriented institutions and from a tax standpoint all of our public shareholders have just gone through the final time that they'll receive in K-1. To make our stock easier to own, we made some additional changes all focused on simplification. We simplified our public reporting with a focus on distributable earnings instead of E&I as our primary earnings metrics and then to get an update on our monetization activities during the quarter to help make DE easier to model. We felt that with both the simplification changes and the conversion we'd have the opportunity to appeal to a broader universe of investors. So what are we seeing as a result? Well, at this point, we've seen a significant increase in institutional sponsorship and positive trends as we look at the composition of our ownership. Page four summarizes our ownership as of December 31, 2018 which is the most recent information available to us compared to our ownership profile a year ago. And you see a few things from this. First, looking at the bottom part of the page, you see an increase in overall institutional ownership. The total number of shares owned by institutions that file 13x has increased by almost $50 million. Most interesting to us though is the composition of those 13x file lists. You see a sizeable increase in the investment management piece with increased ownership both for mutual funds and passive strategies with a meaningful decline in shares owned by hedge funds and broker dealers that are largely hedge funds that own us as well. We feel that the composition of our ownership has improved significantly. In the dialogue we're having with our shareholders as we've talked about on prior calls tends to be more focused on our opportunities over three to five years; instead of over a number of months. And perhaps most importantly, it still feels like we have a long way to go before this transition will be completed. We are still introducing ourselves to new firms and new investors. In summary, if we can continue to perform the way that we have over the last 12 months, and at the same time see continued progress in the transition of our shareholder base. We think that combination really have the opportunities to be powerful for all of us. And with that, I'll turn things over to Bill.
William Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Let's start with investment performance. Please take you a look at Page 5 for the supplement where we summarize gross investment performance across strategies for the trailing 12 months. In private equity, our flagship funds depreciated 10% and our private equity portfolio as a whole appreciated 15%. These [FXs] compare favorably to the MSCI World, which was up 5% on a total return basis. Our real asset strategies are performing with our more mature real estate infrastructure and energy flagship funds up 8%, 11% and 8% respectively. And in credit, our alternative and leverage credit strategies have appreciated 7% and 4% respectively on a blended basis. On the heels of this investment performance, let's turn to Page 6 and review overall where our funds stand today. Of the $123 billion of carry eligible AUM that we manage, the lion's share were 99% is at or above costs, and roughly 71% of that AUM were $88 billion is above its respective hurdle and is either paying or in position to pay cash carry today. One of the most interesting aspects of this page is that this $88 billion figure increased from $57 billion a year ago, 54% increase. So when you look out over the next few years as our younger funds and strategies continue to season and work their way through their preferred returns. We have a significant opportunity to see realized carry generation across a much more diverse number of funds and strategies in addition to traditional private equity. Let's turn to monetization activity in the quarter and carry generation. As reported in our monetization update early this month, activity this quarter was driven primarily by strategic exits, including the sales of Sedgwick United group as well as the secondary GoDaddy. On a blended basis the PE exits were done it 3x our cost and with the GoDaddy transaction, we have now exited the successful investment. In aggregate, over 12 periods GoDaddy returned 5.6x our cost. Turning to fundraising in the AUM roll forward, capital inflows totaled $6.3 billion in the quarter and $30 billion over the last 12 months. Activity in the quarter was diverse with inflows across multiple strategies including private market SMAs, real estate credit, EuroPE and the number of credit strategies including CLOs, leverage credit, private credit and BDC Capital. Capital inflows over the trailing 12 months, it contributed to $58 billion of dry powder at quarter end. Importantly, we also had $20 billion of capital commitments that become fee-paying when they are invested at a weighted average rate of 100 basis point providing direct line of sight towards future management fees. In terms of new investment opportunities this was an active deployment quarter for us. We invested $5.5 billion across businesses and geographies. Public markets deployment was $2.2 billion coming primarily from investments made in direct lending and private credit. And in private markets, we invested $3.3 billion. Approximately one-third of that deployment was in Asia across a handful of private equity opportunities as well as our first quarter investment in that region. We invested $700 million in both infrastructure and America PE, with the remainder falling across Euro PE, real estate and growth equity strategies. Moving to capital market, transaction fees for the quarter totaled $60 million. Unlike the third and fourth quarter of 2018, we did not close on any large investment opportunities with meaningful equity syndication. So transaction fees in the quarter moderated. The fourth quarter for context happened to be a record syndication quarter for us and activity in Q4 with very concentrated with the three largest transactions driving 75% of capital market's revenue. The underlying trends in our capital markets remain consistent with what we've now discuss for some time. The business is global with a healthy component coming from non-KKR-related transactions. This quarter 30% of revenues came from outside the US, and it was a particularly active quarter working with third parties. Over half of our revenue this quarter came from non-KKR related transaction and our pipeline in the second quarter is quite active. In terms of book value, book value per share increased to $16.99 as of March 31, a 17% increase over the last 12 months. Our largest balance sheet Holdings First Data showed its stock price rise 55% in the quarter. Our book value benefited not only from the GP interest we have in the 2006 Fund, but also through the direct co-investment that the balance sheet made alongside our fund investment. So bringing all together our after-tax DE came in at $314 million or $0.38 per share as Craig noted. We continue to operate with an attractive 50% segment operating margin and we maintained our low 40% comp ratio, coming in at the low end of the range of 40% this quarter. Before I turn over to Scott, there are three additional things I'd like to touch on. The first relates the E5 where we've closed a $5.3 billion amount including $4.9 billion of third-party capital to fund positively impacted fee-paying AUM as of March 31, and will contribute to the management fees in the second quarter. Based on third-party capital raised to date Euro IV will add about $45 million to management fees on a run rate basis. The second point is on taxes and related to our conversion from a partnership to cooperation. The tax basis step up that resulted from the conversion depending on the basis of our shareholders at the time of conversion, information that was confirmed this part of the K1 process that was just completed. I'm happy to report that the total tax basis step up came in at about $2.9 billion, ahead of the $2 billion we discussed at our Investor Day. In total, if you assume a 23% tax rate, this will result in approximately $700 million of tax savings over 5 to 15 years, $200 million more than previously discussed. These savings are spread pretty evenly between taxes after goodwill that you'll see over 15 years and a step up in the basis of balance sheet assets and accrued carry is the time of conversion that will reduce cash taxes as those assets is sold. And finally, we increased our share repurchase authorization back up to $500 million, and have used $50 million of that authorization in April. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill, and thanks everybody for joining our call today. This morning I want to spend some time reminding you how young we are as a firm, and the significant growth we expect as a result. It may sound strange for firm that's celebrating its 43rd anniversary tomorrow to say is young, but in our case that happens to be true. Take a look at Page 7 of the deck. It shows how our AUM has grown over time. Since the beginning of 2016, so in just over three years, we've raised over $100 billion of capital organically, which compares to the $120 billion of AUM, we managed in total at that point in time. We've seeing meaningful growth. What it also shows is that we first started to grow in asset classes outside of private equity in the 2004 timeframe. So we were only in PE for our first 28 years. It's really been in the last 15 years that are non-PE businesses were started. And during the 15 year period of time building businesses, we also went global and created our Capital Markets business and our balance sheet. Today, private equity represents about 35% of our AUM and is still growing, as evidenced by our Euro IV fund, which as of March 31st was about 50% larger than its prior vintage. The other 65% of the assets we now manage are from all of the efforts started since 2004. And if you turn to Page 8, you'll see another phenomenon with our younger businesses. It takes time, typically 10 or so years to achieve real scale when you build businesses organically. But we business has reached that inflection point, this scaling can be dramatic. On the slide you can see what happened after year 10 for four of our efforts. The AUM and revenue charts speak for themselves and the P&L scaling is even more extreme given the carry usually starts to be realized sometime between years 5 and 10. From our advantage point, what we find particularly exciting is that the vast majorities of our strategies is less than 10 years old and are approaching that inflection point. Take a look at Page 9, and look down the right-hand column of the page. You'll see 22 strategies listed here and the age of each. Of the 22, only four are more than ten years old. 18 of the 22 have not fully scaled or reached their inflection point. If we perform we believe all of these strategies will scale over time, most of them quite meaningful and the P&L will scale as the asset scale and the carry begins to be realized. And critically, the headcount and expenses required for the scaling are for the most part already here and already reflected in our P&L. So if you think about us, please keep this dynamic in mind; given this in any period our fundraising activities are going to be a mix of younger and more mature strategies. Last year, as an example, we had our $7 billion Infra 3 fund and the first close of our fifth European PE fund which combined totaled over $12 billion of new capital raised in 2018. This year, we have fewer fund raisers across our larger mature flagship strategies. We do, however, have multiple important reasons for our younger strategies including real assets and credit in Asia, technology growth, impact, special situations, European real estate, energy and European credit to name just a few. This is in addition to leveraged credit and our hedge fund partnerships which are in the market fairly consistently. So think multiple smaller raises this year. It's also worth noting that as we stand here today Asia 3 and Americas 12 are each approximately 50% invested or committed. Given this, we expect to have both our Americas and Asia private equity strategies raising capital next year in addition to continued scaling across a number of our businesses globally. So, we expect to see more aggregate capital raised next year than this year given our large raises plans for 2020. But this year is critically important for starting and scaling a number of our businesses and we'll keep you posted as we progress. Given the use of our business and the picture on page nine of the deck, you can see why despite our 43 years of history, we feel like we're in the early innings of the firm, and why we've been growing so quickly with our fee paying AUM of 23% over the past year. We appreciate your support and interest and we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is now open.
William Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning; Thanks for the early disclosure; it's very helpful. Bill, maybe want to start with you, just coming back to the incremental DTA associated with the section 754, something we've been spending a lot of time on ourselves lately, can you give us maybe an updated guide around how that sleeves into the tax outlook for next couple years and does that at all change - and how you sort of think about the ultimate dilution?
William Janetschek: Sure, Bill. Well at a very high level again, the step up that we were afforded was roughly at $700 million and again approximately half of that it could be amortized over a 15-year period. The other half is going to be really tied to the asset sale either on the balance sheet or in the funds particularly. So, it's really hard to time when we're actually going to get that benefit and so we actually gave some color over the last couple of quarters that when we were APP as opposed to a full C Corp our tax rate was about 7%, and that's just rough justice the number if over a five-year period advanced to 3%. That would migrate up to that roughly 21% number. But, again, because it's, half of it is tied specifically to asset sales, it's really hard to predict and so in any particular quarter you might see the tax rate be 9% when you're expecting 12% and it might be 14% when you're expecting 11%, and so, again the only thing that we'll do is we'll keep you posted as we further advance the planning around our tax position and no other color other than that, Bill.
William Katz: Okay. That's helpful. I don't know if you or for Scott, just really curious as you think about your commentary between the capital raising for next year and then slide number nine which has sort of the array of funds versus years. How do you sort of see the dynamics between capital return and growth, just sort of wondering as you continue to scale your assets and diversify both the AUM, as well as your fee related earnings drivers, does that in any way sort of change the dividend payout or sort of just general capital turn and dynamics?
Scott Nuttall: You mean at the public company level, Bill?
William Katz: Yes.
Scott Nuttall: No, I don't think it changes how we've - we've been articulating or thinking about it. I think the point that we want to try to get across everybody is if you look at that slide nine and you look at the 2018 or so strategies that are less than 10 years old, the average life of those is somewhere between year four and year five, and I think what we're trying to make sure everybody understands is that we see significant opportunity to scale those platforms - meaningful growth ahead for those businesses and a lot of those businesses where we are managing fund one maybe fund two, some of them are really new businesses that have been created in the last 12 months. So I think the bigger point we want to make sure everyone understands is that we see significant growth in those businesses though the end markets are quite large especially for areas like infrastructure and real estate. And so the opportunity ahead is dramatic for us, and that's one of the benefits of having the relative youth across a large percentage of our activities globally. It does not necessarily change how we think about the overall capital allocation policies as a company itself, I think the bigger point is we think about management see growth, key related earnings opportunities for growth, and then the opportunity to meaningfully increase our carry from here we see a lot of runway.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody. Wanted to - I wanted to follow up on with a question around management fees, I think I heard you guys say that the Euro V $45 million that it was run rate for the year - what once fees are fully in, could you guys just highlight again whether or not any of that was already in the first quarter? And then I guess, bigger picture, beyond sort of the larger flagship funds that you guys highlighted that sounds like you will start fundraising in 2020, what sort of you expect to be the main drivers of management fees from here kind of in this interim period?
William Janetschek: Alex, this is Bill. As it relates to E V, it went into the investment period on March 31st, April 1st and so the management team will actually come through our P&L in the second quarter. So no management fees are reflected in the first quarter, and, again based upon the capital we raised right now the run rate management fees on that are going to be approximately $45 million. In between now and 2020 as we continue to raise - raise capital, but more importantly remember we've got $20 billion of dry powder that capital that's already been raised as we invest that capital in the ground, you should see an uptick in our management fees. So, that we've got it for our sale wind between now and 2020. And then as it relates to large fund raises out in 2020 depending on obviously the size of the funds, the management fees will be dictated based upon, you know, and the size of the funds that are actually raised.
Craig Larson: And, Alex, it's Craig. What I would like to just run through where we're fundraising currently to give you a sense, we're fundraising for a number of our European strategies. So that's private equity, opportunistic, real estate and credit. In Asia, we are fundraising for strategies outside of private equity within real assets currently, and we're also fundraising across our impact, energy, real estate credit one of our growth strategies, and at the same time, we've areas where we look to raise capital on a more continuous basis that includes our CLO business; we actually priced a US and a European CLO earlier in April, the leveraged credit platforms in the US and Europe as well as the BC and the hedge fund partnerships.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, the only thing I'd like to add Alex, is that if you look, for example last year we raised about $34 billion, I mentioned that $12 billion of that was for Infra III and Europe V, but that leaves an excess of $20 billion that we raised for the non-flagship strategy. So we expect a meaningful amount of activity this year despite the big key is coming next year.
Alex Blostein: Great, thanks for all the detail. My second question was just around some of the activity you guys highlighted earlier, it sounds like the pipelines are pretty active and the capital market conditions remain pretty open and you've seem pretty meaningful appreciation in your portfolio companies this quarter, any update on sort of expected realizations you see so far in Q2? I think, Bill, in the past you guys kind of talked about what sort of to-date known sales might be as we think about 2Q, 3Q?
William Janetschek: Sure, Alex. But remember, I mean we are not even through April. And so when you think about what's actually been closed or what's been signed and to be close that number right now as we stand here today is a little north of $200 million. And when you think about other opportunities when you take a look at the PE portfolio that we've got, roughly about 30% of that is in public securities and so you mentioned that the capital markets is open right now and so there's a lot of ways to drive monetization in between now and the end of the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Gerald O'Hara: Great, thanks. Maybe, maybe just picking up on Slide 4 and the sort of shareholder base evolution comments and metrics provide here all very helpful and insightful. But perhaps you could elaborate a little bit on where you see the continued opportunity to evolve this? Where you might think it is with respect to the evolution in terms of, I don't know, maybe kind of mid-innings, late innings and ultimately where you might see it going in the future? Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hi, Gerry. It's Craig. I would focus on the mutual fund line. If you look at both mutual funds as a percentage of our flow, we're still meaningfully underweight relative to that statistic. If you look at our across S&P 500 financials and on the flip side of that, you still look at that hedge fund and broker-dealer percentage in terms of percentage of our flow. And I think there's still room for that meaningfully to come down, so that the real focus from here is going to be on the mutual fund line, in addition to that other institutional line.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add, Gerry, is if you look at the date on that slide, it's December 31, and as a reminder, our conversion was really just at July 1 last year. And I would argue we lost the better part of a couple of months to holidays and volatility. At the end of the year, so I'd say we're still very early innings.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your line is not open.
Devin Ryan: Great. Good morning. Actually just have a follow-up on that point around the shareholder base evolution, appreciate the update there. I'm just curious whether as you're out and meeting with investors and we're still seeing kind of that shift towards investment management, if there's any themes or kind of difference in themes or feedback from kind of the newer crop of investors relative to the old crop that may be shaping, how you're thinking about, you're running the business, whether it be capital return, your buybacks or anything else that you feel like it's important to continuing kind of this progression towards a higher percentage of call it mutual fund ownership?
Craig Larson: Hey, Devin. It's Craig, look, you won't be surprised to hear me saying this but I love all of our shareholders equally. I think the demand that we found and we feel in answer your question. You look at - if you look at the hedge fund in the broker dealer piece, I think the typical investment horizon for that group does tend to be in a couple of months. And I think we felt this in the fourth quarter when volatility enters the market that group can go risk off, I'll go risk off together and you have a - you can get off side from a supply demand standpoint. And I think that's something that's really impacted the volatility in our stock and the stock of our peers for that matter. On the flip side of that, the conversation when we are having with mutual funds and those other institutional investors really does tend to be much more focused on a 3 to 5 year timeframe and there is much less focused on what the DE contribution was from a secondary, we priced a week prior and instead, there's a focus on something like slide 9, as people try and understand look at these businesses that you're starting, what's the end market and what that opportunity in 3 to 5 years. And so that's thinking is one that really is a lot more aligned, truthful how we think about the firm in the business and that really is a really stark difference as it relates to the dialog that we're --dialog that we're having.
Devin Ryan: Got it. Okay, terrific. Thanks for the color there. And then just a follow-up on some of the expansion, the non-PE strategy is obviously having some success and coming from a smaller base. But I'm curious what you're seeing with your LPs and whether you're expanding the base of LPs or kind of growing relationships as you add more products, so you're kind of widening the net or whether you're seeing kind of the demand in growth is coming from your existing LP base, existing relationships where you're just gaining more market share higher percentage of their wallet among. I'm curious kind of where you are on kind of LP expansion?
Craig Larson: Yes, So, Devin, if we look back at the statistics we shared over time in around 2007-2008 time frame, we had 285 LPs that number's been approaching 1,000. And so I think we've seen two things, one, an expansion in the absolute number of LPs and at the same time there is a real opportunity for us from a from a cross-sell standpoint. So I think is as we build these newer strategies it's really a mix of the two. And we'll often have LPs that have known us for a long period of time that are embracing the opportunities that we see. But at the same time, there are new relationships and strategies that could be more appealing relative to the larger benchmark strategies that we're known for. So I think we still see lots of room for improvement and continued growth on both of those.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Michael Carrier: Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. Given the big rise in carry eligible AUM that's paying now can you provide maybe some color on the age of the funds within the $88 billion and then the exit outlook ahead, though I think you mentioned 30% or Craig 30% public that's more helpful metric, but just any type of color to try to your arms around maybe the realization outlook. Just given where your funds are now?
William Janetschek: Hey, Michael, this is Bill. I couldn't give you an average age per se of what makes up the $88 billion, but what you've actually seen is to state the obvious where one more year older in all of these funds in those funds that we're investing now are getting closer to their harvest period or if you have a fund that with the J-curve with the management fees upfront actually now we are through their preferred returns, when we're at the opportunity now to several investment. We have the ability to pay that cash carry. So again what will end up happening is of all of the businesses that we have and all of the funds that we manage, as those funds continue to mature and performance is there, you will hope to see an increase in the carry eligible AUM just continue to grow. But what we wanted to highlight on Page 6 of that supplement is just to show the power of another year of maturity and the growth in that carry eligible AUM growing from that 57 to the 88.
Scott Nuttall: The one thing I would add, Mike, I think, at our Investor Day last July, we talked about the fact that our carry plus incentive fees has been around $1.3 billion or so, trailing 12 month at that point. And we saw a path for that to go to $2 billion over time. And I think what we're trying to tell you with this slide is it's not just a someday someway path is actually beginning to emerge in the numbers as these strategies season and these funds continue to generate performance. And if you look at Page 11 of the press release, it's pretty good detail on a number of the vehicles that we're talking about in that $63 billion in the right-hand side of the chart. So I think that the punch line from our standpoint is we see even more evidence that the path from the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion to $2 billion is something we're working our way down.
William Janetschek: And then just one more bit of color on Page 8. And that's just spoken on the balance sheet. We've got right now net accrued carry on the balance sheet of approximately $1.5 billion.
Michael Carrier: Okay. Good color. And then Bill, just a small thing, the fee credits this quarter, it seemed a bit higher than what we typically see, anything unusual in there and maybe just provide a little color on what tends to drive that.
William Janetschek: Well, the big driver is actually in private market and transaction fees. So if the transaction fee is up to the extent that we have fee sharing with our LPs, so we'll go the de-credit - transaction fees are down, likewise, the fee credit will be smaller. During the quarter, there was nothing of significance that would, it would have changed that real allocation between how much is it fee we actually record and the sharing that we have with our LPs.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just to start on Slide 8 and 9, the 10-year to scale slide 2, maybe just to start with the capital markets business, perfectly that seem to scale and year after year 10, and moved substantially higher 2017 and 2018. Obviously we had a soft quarter here in 1Q, but if you can sort of - maybe hard to sort of predict, of course, but if you can sort of give some color on what you think, a range maybe your quarterly range of what capital markets fees could be? Over say, the next few years. Just to sort of get a - I guess the comfort of whether we've reached that scale point and we're more like the year 11 there in perpetuity or do we have risk of going back to sort of level that year 10?
Craig Larson: Hey, Brian, it's Craig. I guess a couple of thoughts on that. First, just as it relates to the quarter, and Bill touched on this, but remember, Q1 was really just the market environment. So if you look at new issue volumes in Q1, volumes were down pretty meaningfully. So institutional leverage loan volumes global equity issuance, both down about 40% year-over-year. So it was a lighter quarter in terms of overall activity in the capital markets. And so I think we look at Q1 for us and I actually think we did a very good job in a very difficult quarter. As Bill had mentioned, Q4 was a record quarter for us at three pretty significant event type of financing. So I think we issued the report is remember, though, were those events, financing are going to happen periodically, but you're not going to see those every quarter. So we said historically when you try and think about the framework of Capital Markets, a couple of data points. One, when you look at the activity we had last year, as an example. Transactions where earned fees as of $20 million or more, so those are the larger, more wet types of transactions represented a little over half the revenue. So I think it gives you that help, give you a sense of what can happen periodically. At the same point in time when the AUM and the firm grows, and the strategy grow and as those strategy season is our fund sizes grow, the opportunity set for us from a capital market standpoint grows and grows, goes alongside of grows alongside of our overall presence. So I think we look at the growth in capital markets in terms of the parts from our portfolio companies, and think of that regular way opportunities, one that's going expand, if we transact more that means there should be more opportunities for us from those events driven type of opportunities. And then if you think of the third-party piece, that's another piece that's growing right alongside of this. And Q1 was an example of where that third-party piece was a pretty high number for us. So, I think we look at the overall performance of capital markets, feel really good about that trajectory and how the business is positioned and that's even in the framework of a quarter like we just signed Q1 where volumes were actually down quite a bit.
Brian Bedell: That's good color. Thanks. And then the follow up would be, maybe to Slide 9. And some of the newer strategies. Scott, you mentioned 18 of these are still on the newer side, maybe if you can - again may be difficult to predict of course, but for some of the ones that are moving into that pass the five-year phase and moving closer to that sort of scale period. What kind of - have you guys tried to assess what type of AUM - what level of AUM, you think you could - over say the next five years and some of those categories, if you have conviction. And I guess I'd be focusing mostly on things in Asia as well as Europe.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, sure. I'd say Asia non-private equity is almost all brand new. So if you look at infrastructure, real estate and credit for Asia, which are high priorities for us this year, you can see that those businesses are all in the process of being starting right now. So I'd say significant upside from zero. And so we're in the process of building teams and starting to think about how to be in those activities and some of those activities are already underway. But very early days for Asia, non-private equity. I'd say for Europe, if you look at your real estate, if you could look at Europe direct lending both of those efforts four years or so old, massive opportunity for growth in both. We're still at the consequence of that finishing fund one. So we haven't even seen the Fund One, Fund Two in any material way for Europe in credit and real estate on the more private market side. So significant opportunity for growth there too. I think when we were all together last July at Investor Day we put up a slide, Joe and I did when we talked about our goal across all the efforts that we're is to be top 3 in each of the businesses in which we focused. And the end markets here are so large and our use is such that we see massive opportunities for scaling across virtually every line item on this page. And Europe, and Asia non-private equity would very much be front center.
William Janetschek: Yes, one bit of color again about Asia. When you think about infrastructure, and you think about real estate, a lot of these platforms already established. You already have the infrastructure that's already built. So as we bring on new mandates geographically in Asia, the profit margin from growing that type of business is obviously quite accretive for us.
Brian Bedell: And do you sense any capacity constraints in those areas? I would imagine those markets like you said, Scott, are very - the end markets are huge. Are you concerned at all about too much money getting raised and chasing too few opportunities in Asia and Europe in your Asian and European strategy?
Scott Nuttall: The short answer is no. I'd say the level of interest in investing in alternative assets in Asia in particular is significant, and there just aren't that many players. So we're having a number of good dialogs across the region, as you know, we've got a real footprint, eight offices, a significant investment in talent across the entire region, which we're augmenting. So we are not running into any capacity limitations. It's really just giving our portfolio time to season, so we can get onto raising fund two in Europe and being out telling our story and accessing capital across Asia.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Kevin Chong in for Glenn Schorr. Just had a big picture question, just what are your thoughts on the competitive landscape with the potential for regulated big banks to re-enter as competitors in a more meaningful way, particularly if the re-proposed Volcker Rule goes their way and also certain big traditional asset managers have been making strategic moves either in venturing or expanding in the alternate investment space, what impact are you seeing on the business activities, investment performance and then also maybe talent recruitment and retention? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Great. So on the first - the question about the bank's reentering the lending space. We haven't seen a big impact thus far on our efforts from that. I think we're reading the same media reports that you are, but when we look at the activities that we are undertaking in senior secured direct lending, which is probably where would be most likely to show up. We have not seen that as of yet. We continue to find a meaningful opportunity space especially at the large end of the market. Big companies with $80 million, $90 million, $100 million of EBITDA plus. We have not seen a meaningful change in the competitive landscape to date. In terms of the second question, the traditional asset managers moving into alternatives. There has been some activity in this space. It's received quite a bit of attention. It has not had an impact on our business today.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And as a follow-up and maybe just shifting gears, just curious on what you plan to do with the proceeds of first data once fully monetized to chunk investment things like 14% of balance sheet.
Scott Nuttall: I wouldn't distinguish the first data investment for many others. I think if you look at what we've been doing with our balance sheet, we've been using it to see new strategies for the firm and to invest into this helping the scale, a number of the business is listed on page 9 of the supplemental deck. And you continue to see us do that. We've got $5 billion or so of unfunded commitments to our existing fund vehicles. So a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet, both existing liquidity and liquidity that emerges over time will be used to fund those commitments and to invest further into growth. And what we're doing is focused on using the balance sheet to make sure that we drive fee related earnings growth and the opportunity for carry to grow as well. And just a clarifying point the first data transaction has been a merger announced between First Data and Fiserv just to clarify that in that transaction we will be receiving stock of Fiserv-- no cash proceeds day one.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Chris Harris: Thanks. A few questions on expenses; the comp ratio was right in line with your guidance this quarter. Does that 40% guidance still hold for the year or could you guys potentially do better than that? And then related, can you provide an updated view on the outlook for non-comp expenses for the duration 2019?
William Janetschek: Sure, Chris. What we said was when we tried to simplify our story and just-- really just highlight from an expensive point of view, just compensation occupancy and operating expenses, we said that we're going to try to target a low 40s comp ratio, and so when you think about what we've reported since we've actually converted to C Corp and simplified our reporting structure that number has been pretty close to the 40%. You can see that in the first quarter that is 40% as well. And I'm not going to be able to tell you with specific color that we're going to keep that at exactly 40% from now until the end of the year, that will all depend upon the revenue, obviously, we need to compensate our people in order to make sure that we don't have a retention issue, but as the company continues to perform and the revenue was there, you should expect that comp ratio to stay more or less in line with where it has been this quarter and in the prior quarters. As it relates to expenses, if you go back probably a few years that expense number is roughly anywhere in between 8% and 9%. And I don't think this quarter is any different. As a matter of fact, if I take a look at page six, the other operating expenses this quarter was 9%, last quarter it was 8%, first quarter 2018 was 8% and so, again, when you think about the expenses that we are talking which is compensation and occupancy and G&A 40-ish plus 8% or 9% is going to get 50% which dovetails nicely into what we've been communicating is that we want to actually try to target our margins from a segment operating earnings pre-tax to roughly about 50%.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt, Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you. Follow-up on the capital markets' questions; are there any new investment announcements you could point to that might generate one of those one piece indications you've talked about? And as we think more broadly, as we watch the announcements come through what kind of a size should we look for in terms of announcements that would generate those one-piece indication?
Craig Larson: Patrick, we don't have any specific items support you to at this time. It's always a case of when you are evaluating individuals transactions you never precisely know what's going to get over the finish line, and as I know, you know, we work with co investment partners often times from day one as we're evaluating those. So there is - as Bill had mentioned in the script activity had picked up but nothing to point you to and from a specific transaction standpoint.
William Janetschek: Well, I say into a quarter, Patrick, we're not going to point out individual transactions. I think if you want to look more generally at newer transactions announced across our private markets businesses, where there's a larger equity check and a large debt component, those would be the attributes you'd be looking for the larger things. I would point you to the fact though that we have a number of things that we work on constantly, which are going to not be $50 plus million fee events, but that could be quite meaningful in terms of contributions in the quarter. But if you're looking for the large-scale things, the things that we saw close in Q4, it would be largest indications on the equity in that. So that's just what I look for.
Patrick Davitt: Okay. Thanks. And then my quick follow-up is, did you update us on the revenue and EBITDA growth trends in the P portfolio, and then maybe a broader macro update across your major geographies in terms of what you are seeing in the portfolios.
Scott Nuttall: Sure, so I have no real change from prior quarters; the portfolio continues to perform quite well. So think high single digit to low double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth on a global private equity portfolio basis, if we look at our credit portfolio we are seeing also very strong revenue and EBITDA growth statistics. If you look by region, it's actually been pretty consistent. We've got good growth across US, Europe and Asia regionally. Part of that, of course is where we're choosing to invest because we tend to invest in some higher growth opportunities across a number of the regions. But from a macro standpoint, the economy in the US continues to perform well. We've seen some sectors that have probably been through a little mini recession, parts of industrials, automotives et cetera, but overall when we look at the consumer and services sector in the US continues to perform quite well. Asia, we've seen China bounce back and they've done a lot to re-stimulate the economy. We are seeing that show up in the portfolio, and Europe is kind of a different story depending on the market, but when we look at our portfolio we're quite pleased with the performance.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks and thanks for the patience taking all the questions. Most of mine have been asked, just one quick one maybe going back to earlier capital management question, and specifically on how you are thinking about the dividend, as you grow the business I mean would you argue at all tied into say a specific growth of FRE or management fees or how do you think about kind of that growing the dividend over time or is that not a priority, you'd like to just keep retaining the capital for reinvestment? How are you kind of thinking about that trade-off?
William Janetschek: Hey, Rob, this is Bill, I'll take that one. As it relates to capital allocation, remember, when we talked about the change in our capital allocation policy and going back a couple years ago, we said that is we continue to perform well and we generate revenue and we generate profits that we will monitor our dividend accordingly. So as we continue to grow the business, you would tend to see modest increases in the dividend over time, but away from that, we like our strategy where we retain most of our after-tax profits and continue to put that capital into our balance sheet to invest alongside our third-party investors in the capital that we manage and then on occasion use that capital for strategic activity. So, again, I don't think there's any change in our capital allocation policy since we announced, it going back a few years ago, and the only thing I will tell you to do is stay tuned.
Scott Nuttall: Yes. There is no explicit tie, if that's the question, Robert. I said the articulated strategy is to have a dividend that we intend to grow over time and that has not changed.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Your business has grown a lot over the past 5, 10 years, just curious thinking about the earnings profile as you look forward from here when and if the cycle does turn, I guess, how can you - how do you think about navigating through a downturn with the least impact to your earnings, and how are you thinking about the overall impact to your earnings profile?
Scott Nuttall: Well I'd say - hey, Michael, Scott. I'd say if we see some kind of a market dislocation or downturn, I think that's great news for us. You know we've got that $58 billion of dry powder; we have significant liquidity on the balance sheet to say when we were seeing some dislocation begin to emerge in the US in November and December, we were actually getting pretty enthusiastic around here, and then obviously that lot of that reversed through the course of the first quarter. So I think from our standpoint if we see some dislocation, we think three to five years out that is going to be better for our long term earnings profile if we don't. If we see some in the near term, I think our job globally is to take advantage of it where it emerges, but I think there's a risk that we all end up being a little bit too US-centric in our mindset in discussions like this. We've seen a pretty big dislocation over the last couple of years in different parts of Asia and we've seen it in parts of Europe. We've seen it in elements of the US economy, already and we've been leaning into those opportunities when we have them, and I think our perspective is, it's very hard to judge the investment opportunity by looking at broad market indices. The 50,000 foot view doesn't do much; that's not where we operate. It's where can we find pockets of dislocation and opportunities where we think value is not really recognized by the public markets, and we found a lot of opportunities where the public markets do not like complexity and is over value in growth and simplicity and we've been investing into those situations, and that's where you've seen a lot of our deal flow. A lot of the non-core subsidiary purchases that we've done have come from that where you've got public companies looking to simplify their story, and so we've been very active as you've seen in the numbers. Despite over - when you look at the market indices overall, you haven't seen a big dislocation, but we tend to operate at the five-foot level and not the 50,000 foot level and at five feet there's a lot to do.
William Janetschek: And the one good thing about our model is where we stand here today, we talked about earlier on page nine of the supplement, we're in 22 strategies and we're around the world. And so there might be dislocations in some strategies, but not dislocation in the other. So from a diversification point of view that's why our model is a lot stronger today than it certainly was five years ago, if there was market disruption in one of those strategies.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And so just as a quick follow-up-- maybe just on the strategic partnership relationships that you have, if you could just give an update on those partnerships where we stand today and what the pipeline looks like for new partnerships and how you are thinking about expanding that from here?
Scott Nuttall: And just to clarify, Michael, are you talking about with limited partners that invest with us in strategic partnership format, or are you talking about their hedge funds strategic partnerships?
Michael Cyprys: With the LPs that invest with you.
Scott Nuttall: Great. So thanks for the question. As you know, our - one of our stated strategies is to expand that effort meaningfully. So these, just for reminder for everybody, when we say strategic partnerships, we are talking about large-scale very long-term recycling relationships with our limited partners. So think if someone gives us capital for an extended period of time across multiple strategies, and we have the ability to use those capital two or three times over the course of a relationship. And it's committed upfront on that basis, and we have continued to develop that dialogue on a global basis with a number of different prospects. We are making good progress I'd say with several of those. These tend to be large when they happen and they tend to have a one to two-year plus lead time, but we have a dedicated team focused on that internally and we are pleased that the pipeline continues to develop and a number of those dialogues are beginning to mature in such a way that we are increasingly hopeful, we'll have more to talk about specifically in the not-too-distant future. End of Q&A
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Justin. Thank you everybody for joining our call. Please follow up directly if you have any follow-up questions. We'll speak to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to, Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Sydney. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning we reported our Q4 and full year 2018 results, the fourth quarter rounded out a very strong year for us. Beginning on Page 2 of the supplement, you see our traditional key metric slide that profiles the year and we continue to make good progress across all four of these metrics. For the year our AUM increased 16% and both management fees and our after-tax distributable earnings increased 18%. As of 12/31, if you look in the lower left hand slide, you see that our book value per share was marked at $15.57 up from $14.20 a year ago and it's worth noting that the $15.57 is before a meaningful increase we've seen in some of our more sizable public balance sheet holdings since 12/31. Looking with a little more granularity, let's turn to Page 3. We reported after-tax distributable earnings of 460 million for the quarter or $0.55 on a per adjusted share basis. Despite all of the volatility experienced across markets in the quarter, this marked one of our strongest quarters on record. We had record quarterly and annual fee related earnings. FRE for the quarter was 331 million, bringing full year FRE to 1.1 billion. For the quarter FRE came in 40% above the figures reported for the same period a year ago and for the year FRE increased 23%. This was driven both by growth in management fees, which were a record 1.1 billion for the year as well as continued strong results within our capital markets business. As we evaluate our performance overall, there are five things that we knew we need to do well to succeed. We talked about these on our previous calls. We need to generate investment performance, we need to raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments and then finally we need to use our model to capture more economics across everything that we're doing. I'll update you on the first two and Bill is going to cover the final three. Beginning with investment performance, we all experienced significant volatility across asset classes in Q4. To give you a sense of this, from the beginning of 2108 through September 30, so for the first nine months of the year MSCI World appreciated 5.9% on a total return basis allowing to see all of this in and then some [ph] reversed in the fourth quarter as volatility spiked and index declined 13.3% to finish the year down over 8%. In the fourth quarter, the US high yield index declined 4.7% and the LSTA was up 3.4%. In terms of KKR broadly, we saw mark-to-market declines given this backdrop, but outperformed relative to benchmark. For example, for the quarter our flagship private equity funds declined 5.2% and the overall private equity portfolio was up 8.3% compared to the 13.3% decline in the MSCI World. Focusing on the year you see many of these statistics on Page 4 of the supplement. Our flagship private equity funds appreciated 2.5% and the overall PE portfolio appreciated 5.0% compared to the 8.2% decline in the MSCI World and the 4.4% decline in the S&P 500. In real assets are more mature real estate infrastructure and energy flagship funds were up 8.7%, 7.7% and 7.5% respectively and in credit our flagship alternative credit funds and are leveraged credit funds were up 7% and 1% respectively. Now, while all of this is interesting, given the strong start we've seen in 2019, it also highlights why we don't run the business based on mark-to-market movements over any 90 day period. As we reflect on Q4, what's noteworthy to us isn't that the S&P declined13.5%, but instead in a quarter where you saw this volatility, we generated over 500 million and realized performance investment income, a record management fees, capital markets activity and fee related earnings and ultimately reported 460 million of after-tax DE, the second highest quarterly figure for us over the last three years. The beauty of our model is that we get to time our entries and exits. We're not for sellers during this period. Moving on to fund our AUM really forward, we reported 11.3 billion of new capital raised in Q4. That's the strongest quarter of the year. In a particular note, we held a 5 billion first close on our next flagship European private equity fund. We've spoken for some time about the benefits of scaling subsequent funds across strategies and this announcement certainly fits squarely within that framework. In the public markets inflows in our leverage, credit strategies and CLOs were the key drivers of new capital raised. Public markets AUM also did see the impact of both the Nephila sale as well as the incremental 5% Marshall Wace purchase, which resulted net in an outflow of approximately a billion as we discussed on last quarter's call and AUM of course reflects the impacts of the mark-to-market volatility over the quarter. Looking at the full year, our AUM increased 16% year-over-year and our fee paying AUM increased 20% given our organic fundraising activities as well as the FS investments transaction that closed earlier in 2018. And critically we've been able to maintain attractive terms, as approximately 80% of our AUM has the ability to earn performances. These inflows contributed to 58 billion of dry powder at year end and we now have over 23 billion of capital commitments that become fee paying as that capital is either invested or as it enters its investment period and that's at a weighted average rate of just over 100 basis points, helping provide direct line of sight towards future management fees. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
William Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Moving on to new investment opportunities, we had an active quarter, investing 6.3 billion across businesses and geographies, with an additional 4 billion of syndicated capital, bringing total activity in the quarter to over $10 billion. In private markets we invested a 4.3 billion. The largest contributors were to private equity investments, BMC and Envision, both of which had meaningful equity syndication alongside our fund capital. We also invested over 800 million across a handful of investments in Asia private equity, as well as 600 million in a French telecom tower investment out of our infrastructure strategy. Looking at deployment over the course of the year, we invested 13 billion in private markets, with just over half of that coming from traditional private equity. The rest came from the combination of our real asset, growth equity and core equity platforms, showcasing the growing diversity of our firm. In public market, all the volatility experienced across credit markets in the quarter was quite helpful to us as we deployed a record 2 billion primarily from our private credit and special sit strategies. Shifting the monetizations, we saw a healthy level of exit activity in the fourth quarter. As mentioned in our intra quarter press release strategic sales in two secondaries drove 420 million of gross realized carried interest and realized investment income we reported this morning and on a blended basis the PE exits were done at over three times our cost. Looking at full year, our private equity funds distributed over 10 billion of capital to our investors, which in turn contributed to roughly 1.2 billion of realized carry. To give you an update on magnetizations, as we stand here today, based on transactions that have closed or signed transactions that are expected to close in the first half of 2019; gross realized carry and total realized investment income is expected to be approximately 400 million. And just to be clear, First Data is not a part of that $400 million figure. Post quarter end, in mid-January, it was announced that First Data is to combine with Pfizer. This pending transaction would not be a realization of KKR as our shares in First Data would be exchanged for Pfizer at close. Since December 31 through last night, First Data stock price has gone up by about $7.50 per share or a 45% increase. All else being equal, that increase represents $0.55 cents per share of KKR after tax book value. And finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets and balance sheet to capture a greater economics for our investors and our shareholders. Like up the last quarter, which was discussed in detail, BMC, Envision and a French telecom tower investment were similar furred wide transactions. They all required a global effort across multiple teams to collaborate and execute. BMC and Envision together generated approximately 140 million of capital markets transaction fees. So in summary, 2018 was a strong year for us. Our AUM, management fees, fee related earnings and after-tax distributable earnings were up or between 16% and 23% compared to 2017. We used our model well, we continue to scale and in July, we completed our conversion from a partnership to a corporation. Page 5 of the supplement lists the five fundamental drivers in the firm. And we saw a continued progress against all of them. And we're really excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Bill. And thank you everybody for joining our call today. I'd like to spend a few minutes outlining three of our key priorities for this year. The first priority is Asia. Today, we're the leading private equity franchise in the region with a strong and distinguished track record. In addition, for a number of years now, we've been hiring local talent and building integrated teams across non-private equity strategies like real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit and making investments through our funds, separate accounts and the balance sheet. The next step for us is the direct expansion of these non-PE strategies in Asia, all of which we've launched or plan to launch in 2019. Second is scaling real estate more broadly, real estate is one of our youngest businesses with an enormous end market. Since launching the platform, we've made a lot of progress building out the foundation. Today, the business is global, with over 65 professionals based in nine offices across seven countries. And we're managing about 6 billion in AUM through debt and equity focused funds and permanent capital vehicles. Our focus is continuing to scale the platform with additional pools of capital, both debt and equity across the US, Europe and Asia. In 2019, we expect to see fundraising for strategies across all three geographies, largely comprised of first and second generation funds. Stepping back, we see significant runway in this asset class and many different ways to grow the business and create value over time. Our third priority is investing aggressively into dislocation. We've been seeing valuations drop in Asia and parts of Europe over the past couple of years and we may be seeing the beginning of a similar dynamic in the US. In Q4 as Craig noted, US high yield indices declined 5% and the S&P 500 declined 14%. The last time US equity markets underperformed to this extent was in the third quarter of 2011. The growth of our firm and business model has been significant since then. You see some of these stats on Slide 6 of the deck. In Q3 2011, we had 13 billion of dry powder, today we have 58 billion. And today's dry powder is more global, more diversified and more flexible. Also, cash and investments on our balance sheet have more than doubled over this timeframe and our capital markets team is more integrated across the firm and has expanded globally. We're focused on ensuring the entire firm is working together to use the model we have built to invest aggressively into dislocation when and where it arises and creatively provide capital to companies in need. We'll keep you updated on these priorities and our progress over the course of the year. And with that, we're happy to take your questions
Operator: Thank you.
Craig Larson: And Sydney, it's Craig. If we could just ask everybody to please ask one question and one follow up if necessary, just to make sure we work our way through the queue. That would be great.
Operator: Okay, wonderful. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks. Just to get a little follow up to Scott's comments on scaling real estate more broadly, obviously, we're all for a big huge market for you to tap into. Could you talk about where you think you are in terms of having the performance to be able to go to market in all three geographies, is the distribution network there? And then in a first or second generation fund, what type of opportunity are you looking at it in '19 and '20 in terms of for these capital raises? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Glenn. We tried to take those interns. I'd say for our real estate business, it's still very early innings. Most of these strategies under our real estate platform have been launched in the last two or three years and the real estate business itself was launched about six years ago and we continue to add new strategies in new geographies every year. In terms of your questions, the performance has been great. We've seen really strong performance across the entire platform, both equity and debt. Yes, we think our distribution network is in place to allow us to scale those businesses. And in terms of the third part of your question, the first or second generation funds, the answer varies depending on the market. The first business that we created was really opportunistic equity in the US and so we're on our second fund there are REPA fund and over time we'll continue to scale that. We think that platform can be a lot bigger in time. We've also created an opportunistic equity strategy in Europe and are in the process of raising capital for our first such fund in Asia. So the first bucket is opportunistic equity broadly defined. And we are also in the equity side looking at other opportunities like Core-Plus, which we think could be an interesting growth opportunity for us over time and a variety of other strategies that are equity facing and we're just starting to talk to investors about those as well. So think about it as globalizing, but we started in the US and now we're taking the efforts to Europe and Asia and looking to scale there too. In addition to what we're doing on the equity side, there's a lot happening in the real estate credit part of the business which we don't talk about as much. We have a whole loan business on the mortgage side that today we execute largely through our public REIT, which is called KREF. We also have a CMBS B-Piece business which we call RECOP, which is out raising money for its second fund. And we're launching new strategies over the course of this year in real estate credit too. So when you put all that together, we think this can be a very large business for us in time, some very large multiple of the 6 billion or so we managed today and we're really pleased with the performance today.
Glenn Schorr: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
Patrick Davitt: Good morning. Thank you. The Press over the last week has been reporting on a number of senior departures, particularly in the public market side. I'm curious on your thoughts on the drivers of this, if you think it's outsized relative to history? And then as we think about public markets growth going forward, do you remain comfortable that this hasn't impaired the fundraising capability?
Scott Nuttall: Hey Patrick, it's Scott. The short answer is, don't believe everything you read. We're always - we always have been, we always will be a meritocracy and an entrepreneurial place. I say it's very natural for us to see some year-end departures and promotions. And in fact, in our business it's critical and really healthy to make room for people and on occasion to upgrade talent. So periodically, you're going to see people retire or leave. And you also see as others get promoted and new people join, but just to put it in context, and we have about 13 - approaching 1300 employees of which about 160 are partners and managing directors and both figures have been growing as we build for the future. So the bottom line is, I wouldn't overreact to a couple of departures. We've got a really deep bench of talent and feel great about the talent in the firm and we view all this as ordinary course and healthy for a firm like ours.
Patrick Davitt: Thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our following question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alexander Blostein: Great. Hey, good morning everybody. I was hoping you guys could help just kind of bridge some of the balance sheet moves we saw in the quarter, so I guess looking at total investment balances and the sort of the quarter-over-quarter decline, so call it 9.9 total versus 10.3. How much was the mark versus kind of net sales and deployment and then specifically, maybe just zoning in on credit business specifically that's where some of the bigger declines sequentially came from. Again, just help us break the mark versus any sort of activity.
William Janetschek: Hey, Alex, this is Bill. I'll take that question. When you're looking at the balance sheet on Page 9, you're going to see some of the activity with the reduction in value is just from exiting some investments that were replaced, so depending on strategy, but a good amount of that was again just on a mark-to-market basis, so some write down in a portfolio. So when you look at the balance sheet, one of the biggest investments we have is for First Data, the First Data we're down 30%. Again, on a mark-to-market basis we report that based on a closing stock price, but as I mentioned in prepared remarks, we actually saw First Data rebound and it was actually up 45%. And so had it closed at yesterday price on December 31 you wouldn't actually see as much of volatility, which is again one of the reasons why we're happy that we don't report on an ENI basis anymore. We're still going to do the valuations and report intrinsic book value like we do, but as you know the beauty of our business is that we time exits and so in market volatility, we're not sellers we're holders and we wait for recovery and we sell at with the prices we want to sell at. As it relates to credit in particular, you asked me to just focus a little more on that. When you think about performance on a quarterly basis those assets were marked down, but when you look at that and take a look at the credit portfolio on the balance sheet for the entire year those positions were actually up. And so again on credit you might see a reduction in value, a portion of that is just sales of some of the assets and we rotated that into other places on the balance sheet and some of it is again just on a mark-to-market basis. The last point I'll mention is, remember about exiting when we want to exit. The good news is when you take a look at on Page 6, realized investment income we actually had net gains of roughly about $80 million from those balance sheet assets.
Alexander Blostein: Got it, great, thanks and then just my follow up question is around the capital markets business. Again, very strong results in the quarter, I was hoping you can talk to how the capital markets business performed specifically in December and really settle your ability to intermediate transactions at a time of dislocation. Obviously there's a question mark, how stable this business could be in a more challenging market backdrop. So I was wondering if there's something we could learn from the December activity?
Craig Larson: Hey, Alex, this is Craig. Let's just start broadly in thinking about the business as a whole and then can at least help frame how we think about the business and in the portion of that the maybe the baseline versus those more event driven things. But I think one of the things that's critical to understand stepping back is the growth we've seen in the business as a whole really reflects a few things. It certainly reflects the growth in the firm, but it reflects so much more than that. For the first five years, capital markets revenues were really only driven by our private equity business, and it was heavily US centric. Today the revenues are meaningfully more diversified. It's not just private equity, it's across all our strategies, it's not US, it's global and it's not just KKR, a third-party business at this point is also a real contributor. And at the same time, we've just become much, much better at integrating capital markets and everything that we're doing and capturing a higher share of that activity. Now, in terms of your question and thinking about the business and how to frame the revenue profile, it might be lumpy from one quarter to the next but if you think of this on a trailing 12 month basis, there's a baseline business and then added to that baseline business or these larger events. Now these events typically surround deployments, not exits, but they can be meaningful as evidenced this quarter as Bill touched on by Envision and BMC. So to try to help frame the magnitude of these events, when you look at 2018, transactions where we earned fees of $20 million or more that represented a little over half of our total revenue. So there's a baseline amount of activity, that baseline amount should be growing for us over time. And then there's the opportunity for that to be supplemented by these events that can be quite additive to the revenue line in any specific quarter. So hopefully that helps frame how we think about the business.
William Janetschek: I'd just add a little more color on the numbers on just capital market. Just to give you an idea with the breadth of the business, number of transactions during 2018 over 200, and in that - in the fourth quarter that the - and when you think about the breadth again and the business is roughly 20% of a very large revenue number came from our third-party business and about a third of the economics from capital markets came from outside the US
Alexander Blostein: Yes, that's very helpful. Thanks guys.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Robert Lee, KBW. Your line is now open.
Robert Lee: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm just kind of curious, I mean, certainly wasn't [indiscernible] your fundraising, but given the fourth quarter volatility and I guess concerns at least at the very start and maybe not the last couple weeks whether it's around credit or trends or whatnot? I'm just curious if LPs or perspective LPs are - even if they're still investing kind of how their thought process may have been impacted by events in the fourth quarter or the types of questions that are asked. I'm just trying to get a sense of how maybe their appetite has shifted subtly or not? And then maybe the second part of that, can you also update us on kind of LP expansion in terms of number of LPs are you now seeing pick up multiple strategies and kind of the broadening your LP base?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Hey, Robert, it's Scott. I'll take that. On the LP appetite question, haven't really seen a change. I think there was a - few weeks there where people were just trying to figure out which way the world was going, but I think the reversal that we've seen so far this year has abated that kind of a question or discussion. So the bottom line is today no real change in LP dialogue. If anything, I think the LPs take a longer-term perspective and the general view is that we're entering a lower return environment for the markets more broadly. And in that context, you know, we have a lot of discussions around clients feeling like they're going to need more alternatives, not less in order to hit their targets. So kind of as if the idea is beta is going down, you got to go find alpha elsewhere and alternatives have historically been the main generator, and we think that's good for us. We also think is the overall market return drops. The illiquidity premium that we're able to generate actually increases as a percentage of their overall return, and so, that's meaningful for us too. So, the LP appetite has not seen any change to date and if anything, you know, we're having some conversations where they recognize there's even more that we should be doing together. In terms of the second part of the question of broadening of the LP base, as you know, that continues to be a key strategic focus for us. We've got today about 965 investors to be precise, on average, we are kind of selling two KKR products to each investor. But importantly, we only have 40% of our LPs in more than one product. So if you look at the largest investors we have, they tend to average about 4.5 products. So we see upside across everything I just said. We think the number of investors can continue to grow, we think our cross sell metric can continue to grow. And we think there's material opportunity to penetrate newer markets that we've talked about in the past and grow further in insurance, retail, sovereign wealth, et cetera.
Robert Lee: Great, thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Gerald O'Hara: Great, thanks. Maybe picking up on that - on that retail idea there for a moment, could you perhaps give us a little bit of an update as to how you see the outlook there into 2019? And of course, appetite and demand as well will be helpful. Thank you.
Craig Larson: Hey, Gerry, it's Craig. So, we've got several approaches here, the first is within our client and partner group. We have a team that's dedicated and spends all their time talking to family, offices and high net worth individuals. So we have that direct approach where we're working with families around the world and they're investing with us across a variety of strategies. We also have a long list of platform relationships. So think of this as bank's high net worth third-party platforms where we'll sell our products through their sales force, that's also been growing nicely. There's - so there's the direct component, there's a platform piece. And again, both of those are global. We also will work with partners. So we have a desire certainly not only have inside the firm what absolutely needs to be inside the firm. I think the relationship and partnership we have with FS is a great example of how we work with partners. FS is built out a lot of capabilities that we admire and have a few hundred people that spend their time focused on being in best-in-class as it relates through to their channel. And they're much better at raising funds to hundreds of thousands of individual investors probably than we ever could be. And I think that the opportunity set for that expanse also beyond just the - in the long-term just simply BDCs. So I'd say, when we think of where we were really from a standing starting this effort around six years ago, it's now probably is 10% to 15% of the money that we raised quarter-in quarter-out. And I think as we think of that opportunity in particular with FS, the opportunity for us to do better.
Gerald O'Hara: Great, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up for Bill and apologies if I missed it, but could you give us a sense of where the FRE margin kind of shook out in 4Q or for the year? And then perhaps what the outlook there might be with the puts and takes around investment in Asia platform real estate et cetera kind of going forward? Thank you.
William Janetschek: So I'll take the first and I'll let Scott follow-up on the second one, but as it's relates to fee related earnings margin, when you take a look at page six, it's quite robust. And when you take a look at the way we define fee related earnings is that those margins are roughly about 58%.
Scott Nuttall: Yeah, in terms of the second question, yeah, well, we will be continuing to invest in growth but as we do that, we've got a number of the investments that we've made in growth over the last three to five years starting to reach some maturity and generate incremental revenues. So we don't see a reason to believe that there's going to be a significant amount of downward pressure on that we think we can fund the growth with the - in terms of CapEx spending with the revenues that we're expecting from newer efforts.
Craig Larson: And then Gerry, it's great, just one final definitional point. If you look on that incentive fee line in –for the year 2018, we had about 140 million of incentive fees, approximately 50 of those came from the BDC platform. So I think some of our peers when they define FRE include the incentive fees from the BDC platform, we do not in our definition of FRE so just again wanted to highlight that is as you think about that apples-to-apples across the group.
Gerald O'Hara: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our following question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Michael Carrier: Thanks. Good morning. Given some of the concerns still in the market during 4Q in credit, could you provide maybe a little color if you saw much of a change in the portfolio fundamentals versus the mark-to-market? And Bill I think you mentioned, 2 billion deployed in credit, so maybe any color on those opportunities? It has the backdrop to deploy gotten a bit better with the 4Q scare. Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Mike, it's Scott. The short answer is that really no change in portfolio fundamentals in Q4, I think, yeah, there's some sectors, which had been seeing some kind of pull back in revenue growth over the prior several quarters. And no, no, nothing I would point out is materially different in Q4 versus the prior three quarters. I think to some extent our perspective is the market ended up getting quite anxious at the end of the year and put forward a number of concerns about whether a recession was coming sooner rather than later. And then a number of the markets there seemed to be a bit of an overreaction to that anxiety, especially in the US So we did see a pullback in the liquid credit markets, particularly in December. And we did see opportunity to lean in even more on the private credit side. But I don't think I would tell you that a lot of that was due just to the markets getting disrupted for a couple of weeks. Some of these deals had been in process for a long period of time. And a lot of what we're seeing from a deployment standpoint, especially at a private credit is really just using the model that we've now built with our partnership with FS, the ability to lean into larger transactions and we are underwriting now much larger deals where we find that there's less competition and more attractive terms. So no fundamental difference and we continue to be busy on the large end.
Michael Carrier: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
William Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Good morning, everybody. So two questions from me, one is on performance fee and incentive fees, I appreciate that how you define it by the way in the FRE, that's great. But just how we think about pacing and the magnitude, is there anything unusual this year? Just trying to sort of think through the addition of Franklin Square versus performance in the year versus more of a run rate to try and get this more of a trend for process on that?
William Janetschek: Sure, Bill, I'll take that question. When you look at the incentive fees overall for the entire year was about 140 million, roughly 80 million of that came from Marshall Wace, and when you think about it, just a clarifying point, Marshall Wace incentive fees are crystallized on October 1st. So they're on a fiscal year basis. And so you're going to actually see that that number come through as it has in the fourth quarter. When you think about Franklin Square and the BDCs, you know, as Craig mentioned, the incentive fees actually have to get calculated every single quarter and it's driven by performance. Whereas management fees are usually based on invested capital or committed capital and so that - that's why we actually report that in incentive fees. But if you go back over the last four quarters, that number from the BDCs is anywhere between $12.5 million and $15 million. So I don't want to say that the run rate number, but since that transaction closed in April, that incentive fee both from CCT and Franklin Square is again anywhere in between $12.5 million and $15 million. Keep in mind that you would also have seen incentive fees come through prior to that from BDCs when we were just managing the CCT capital pool, but now on a combined basis, that number is actually been elevated.
William Katz: Okay, it's very helpful. And then just a follow-up from me and thanks for taking both questions, just in terms of capital management, you've been working down your authorization and I think you have a couple of million dollars left. So just sort of stepping back, just given all the growth opportunities that Scott articulated in the momentum of the business. How are you thinking about maybe cap [ph] return at this point in time and I was wondering if you can sort of address maybe the dividend policy as your few-related earnings and committed capital grow versus buy back?
William Janetschek: Okay. On the buyback, you can see that during the quarter we've actually been pretty busy and so if you refer to page three in a press release, we've actually put together a table, which we think is quite helpful and you can see that really from October 1st all the way through January 25, we've been in the market either buying back shares or actually canceling shares that's been to our employees. But again, the magnitude of that number is $160 million. When you think about the dividend, remember, we just change our dividend policy when we went to a C Corp. And so the stated dividend policy was $0.125. We just enacted that two quarters ago. And so I wouldn't expect to see much movement there anytime soon. But keep in mind that what we did communicate is that over time to the extent that the business continues to grow, and we continue to grow our management fees and more stable revenue from the balance sheet, that it is expected that that dividend number would continue to grow. One other thing Bill, I just want to highlight that when you take a look at this share count, I just wanted to call out the fact that what we had done historically was issue anywhere between 1.25% and 1% of - 1.5% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2018, as far as compensation is concerned, we only issued on net basis roughly about 3 million shares compared to that 13 million. And so what we're doing is we are making sure that what we said was that when we change our capital allocation policy in the fourth quarter 2015, we would make sure that it wouldn't be share credit with regard to our share count based upon issuance to our employees and we're trying to make sure that we honor that commitment.
William Katz: Okay. Thank you very much.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our following question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Devin Ryan: Great. Good morning, everyone. First question here. Just a quick follow up on operating expenses, just given that really a bit elevated in the quarter. Not sure if that's seasonal or elevated capital markets revenue related, but when we look at the full year relative to kind of total revenues, it's in a similar ballpark as prior years at about 9%. So just trying to think about whether that's an appropriate level moving forward and also how to just think about the aggregate level of growth in the 2019 over '18?
William Janetschek: Sure, Devin. You are right, if you look at the fourth quarter number, it's elevated and what happened in the fourth quarter is that across several of the demand data was private equity across all three regions in infrastructure and real estate, we ran out there a couple of investments that we ended up not doing. And so you see an elevated level of broken deal expenses in that number. In addition, capital markets, as I mentioned, was quite busy, 50 mandates, we actually ended up incurring some syndication expenses, which show up on this line and so that's elevated. So I wouldn't focus on the fourth quarter as the new run rate number by any means. You should probably look at the third quarter is something closer to the reality of the expense base. One other thing that we like to mention is that when you think about what we've communicated, we said that we've got three income streams and really two expense basis; one is compensation and the other is G&A and occupancy. And as you can see, we were trying to strive for a margin of about 50% plus. As we've communicated, the compensation number is, we said it would be in the low 40%s and if you take a look, this quarter was down about little less than 37%, but the entire year was about 40%, and the occupancy and G&A is roughly anywhere in between 7% to 9%, depending on the quarter. As we continue to grow this business, you should see margin improvement in that OpEx line over time.
Devin Ryan: Got it. I appreciate all that color. And then just the follow-up is deployment question kind of bigger picture, you know, in Asia, valuations had been pressured, at least to some degree, probably because of slowing growth and I think that was one of the factors that that drove some of the volatility kind of in the US or at least perceptions of slow growth in the fourth quarter. So to the extent that we are later in the economic cycle. From a timing perspective, how are you guys balancing the opportunity that defined kind of some more attractive long-term valuations today, I know you're quite excited about number of things in Asia, but also balancing that versus kind of the potential risks that could come with, you know, slowdown in growth in the short term. And really just trying to think about, are you guys shifting kind of what you're looking at, or what are some of the considerations, because I think there's always some concern that a lot of capital is going to get deployed right at the kind of the end of an economic cycle?
Craig Larson: Yeah, Devin, it's Craig, let me spend a minute, really, I think, on the two things we'd highlight as relates to levels of activity and then can just speak very briefly geographically and this is through a private equity lens. I think the - when you look at our investment activity, you really see two things, and the first is you see us leaning into complexity. So we're focused on those opportunities where we can really bring our operational expertise to bear and either help reposition an investment or in some cases even restructure these investments. And so what are some examples of these, last quarter we talked about the Unilever transaction, carve outs are complicated and in global carve outs may even be probably even more complicated. And we have had a global team in that instance that evaluated this business, it operates in both developed and undeveloped markets. It's, again, just very complicated, there's a lot of complexity in terms of executing on an opportunity like that. Envision is an investment where we're going to be focused together with management on a series of operational improvement initiatives and BMC the mainframe industry, again, is certainly industry with complexity. So, complexity and operational improvements, that's the first thing. I think the second thing you see is, is really our activity in healthcare that that we view as, as being a more defensive - more defensive sector. So in the US, certainly it's an enormous market, healthcare spending accounts were around 18% of US GDP. It's growing, it's fragmented and we've been active. In private equity investments, this quarter, again, would include and Envision, if you think more broadly, over the last 18 months or so, Internet brands acquired acquisition of WebMD, we acquired Nature's Bounty, Air Medical acquired a company called American Medical Response. We formed a partnership with Walgreens to acquire for PharMerica. There's a pending additional investment as PharMerica announced a transaction with BrightSpring. So again, I think all of that helps give you a sense of how busy our team's been. Activities not limited just to private equity, so when our core strategy in 2018, we acquired a company called PetVet in Q1, Heartland dental in Q2. It's also not limited to just the US, we have a pending investment in Genesis Healthcare, it's one of the largest providers of cancer and cardiac care in Australia and Europe, is again, is within core. We've created a company called SinoCare in China, again, I think you get a sense of the level of activity in that sector for us. So I think where we are, you know, broadly in going by geographies in the Americas, I think the area of emphasis for us are going to be companies and sectors that are more defensive. Not every investments going to fit this profile, but certainly accurate in terms of what you've seen from us broadly. Asia, you're right, 2018 was an active deployment year for us and our backlog here is actually pretty healthy. Our team in China is busy. We've been seeing more control-oriented investments, which is exciting for us. And we're also seeing a greater number of conglomerate and carve out opportunities. So it feels like some companies have expanded in China have found its competitive, a unique environment and are now considering whether to rationalize and sell those businesses. So that's interesting for us. And in Europe, broadly, we're being disciplined given valuations. But we are seeing dislocation in the UK and most specifically. So hopefully that, again, gives you a sense of where we're active.
Scott Nuttall: The only color I'd add, Devin, is that we have been investing for the last three, four years, assuming that the investments that we've been making, we will need to hold through some kind of an economic pullback. So if you look at how we've been pricing assets in the US, we're assuming that there's going to be some form of recession in our whole period, largely assuming we get out of the lower multiple than where we get in. So we've been kind of pricing in and of the environment that's coming for a while. So to the extent we're closer to it, it's not really a new fact for us. We've kind of been assuming given how long we hold assets that we would have to ride through anyway. But at a really high level, I mean, we've got 58 billion of dry powder in terms of third-party capital we have a liquid balance sheet. We are getting our special situations and distress teams even more integrated alongside their private markets, colleagues, private equity, infrastructure, real estate, so everybody can work together and use the flexibility we have in our vehicles and all the tools at our disposal to invest into dislocation and complexity where we find it. So we actually are quite upbeat in terms of the opportunity that can be coming our way. And to your point, Asia and Europe have already seen a lot of that re-pricing.
Devin Ryan: Yeah, I will really appreciate all the detail. Thanks, guys.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Chris Harris: Hey, thanks, guys. So when I look at your investment performance information on slide four, there's a lot of good detail here but one of the things that really jumps out at us is the - energy business being up 7% while the S&P - E&P index was down 28%. So can you guys elaborate and discuss a little bit about how you are able to achieve that level of outperformance and what was it really challenging year for that industry?
Craig Larson: Hey, Chris, this is Craig. Thanks for the question. You know, within the energy income and growth strategy, the type of opportunities that have been most interesting to us are acquiring, you know, for instance, non-core assets, so investments where you're in the midst of the decline curve in partnership, obviously, with a very strong management team. And in those investments we'll hedge out a very healthy percentage of your near term production. So, over the first number of years, two, three years of those investments will have hedged out the vast majority of whether it's crude or natural gas production. So that allows us to, for the valuations we have to be a lot more insulated. So if you look at commodity prices in Q4, you're right, you saw a meaningful downdraft and include prices much less though as it relates to natural gas were pretty equally split between crude and natural gas production. But it's that hedging program and action that you see there that that really was - is a real contributor relative to something like the E&P index.
Chris Harris: Okay, very good. And a quick follow up for Bill. Hey, Bill, how should we be thinking about the tax rate for this year?
William Janetschek: Yeah, that's a good question. When you take a look in the fourth quarter, the percentage was 9%, last quarter it was 12%. And when we communicated to you all when we made the conversion to C-Corp, we said that our tax rate at the time was roughly about 7%. We were fortunate enough to have made in an election, but we got a very big step up in our assets and also we're able to amortize goodwill. And so that benefit we said would come to fruition over the next five years. So five, six years out, our corporate rate will be 21% at the federal level. And it's really hard to predict what it's going to be year-to-year and never mind quarter-to-quarter. But the simple rule of thumb is you should assume that the tax rate is going to escalate roughly 3% a quarter. The reason why it was down this quarter is that one of the assets that it gotten a very large step up when it was sold, the taxes paid on that was minimal, which actually drove the tax rate down. So, the punch line is, for modeling purposes, you should probably use a tax rate of anywhere in between 11%, 12% for 2020 - sorry, 2019. And as we mentioned, we will keep you updated along the way to the extent that something changes.
Chris Harris: Great, thank you.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning, just hoping you could give us an update on the fundraising pipeline. I know you mentioned last quarter that you'd expect to have six funds in the market for 2019 and I believe which funds are those that you expect to be in the market for 2019? And any color on how we should think about sizing?
Craig Larson: Mike, this is Craig, let me just review the - our current initiatives, so we're currently fundraising across European private equity impact, energy, European credit as well as one of our growth strategies in real estate. We're fundraising for an Asian equity strategy and a US credit strategy. We're fundraising for an additional two strategies expected to be launched in the coming weeks. At the same time, there are the areas where we look to raise capital on a more continuous basis that would include the CLO business, raising price there for [ph] CLO of the year, roughly a week ago, leverage credit platforms in the US and Europe and the BDCs and hedge fund partnerships. And then finally, just tying the fundraising to management fee growth, again, as we mentioned, we have over 23 billion of capital in our AUM that will become fee paying is out of the capitals invested or funds are turned on at a weighted average rate of just over 100 basis points. So I think you put that all together and our fundraising team is - our fundraising team is busy.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thanks for the color there. And just as a follow up question, circling back to Asia, an area you guys are targeting for expansion and growth, if you could just kind of flush out, hoping to flush out a little bit more around how you're thinking about approaching the expansion of the business in Asia, which countries do you see the most growth in and if you could just talk a little bit about how you're approaching distribution across the different countries understanding could be a bit different. Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Michael, it's Scott. So, I'd say the couple of different aspects to the Asia story. First is, as we mentioned, the focus on building the non-private equity businesses and creating dedicated strategies for what has been some ongoing investment activity there already. So just give you a sense for the footprint, we had eight offices in Asia, but 270 people on the ground today and we have a very integrated platform and approach. So we have country teams throughout the region. And so what we are doing is building our non-private equity businesses in a very integrated way alongside in with their private equity colleagues. And so what we're really focused on now is scaling in infrastructure, real estate and credit. And as you've seen, we've been making some hires in the region with a focus on those areas. And kind of the answer to which parts of the region are most interesting kind of depends a little bit on which of the strategies that we're talking about. As we see more opportunities for credit in the kind of more Southeast Asia and Australia parts of the market, real estate more opportunities perhaps in North Asia and infrastructure is kind of a mix. In terms of the overall private equity efforts in Asia, we continue to see a lot of opportunity for growth there too. In particular, recently we've been busy in Japan where we're seeing significant opportunity to buy non-core subsidiaries. We think that wave is continuing and gaining pace and we think there's even more for us to do in Japan on the private equity side and also in areas like real estate overtime. In terms of distribution of these new non-private equity strategies, it is not just an Asia distribution story. We're finding investors all around the world or under allocated to Asia and so our distribution approach for all of our Asia strategy is a really global one and in fact there are not that many alternative providers in Asia. So when we're talking to them about things that we're doing private equity infrastructure, real estate, credit, relative to what we see in terms of the competitive landscape in the US and Europe, there's just fewer players. So we have a team on the ground raising money in Asia of course and that we're focused on these products and others, but we're using the global team to distribute.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thanks so much. I appreciate your color.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow up question from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. If your line is on mute, please unmute.
Patrick Davitt: Hey, sorry. Thank you. Sorry, good morning. It looks like the consensus realized carrier expectations are still well above the current guide and obviously there'll be more stuff announced and completed as we go along. Do you think that's achievable now that markets are back up and more open and then in that vein as we look into the second half, are there any restrictions on your selling your Pfizer shares once the FTC share closes?
Scott Nuttall: Well, Patrick, we could only give you as much information as we know today. We're not going to project what the end of the second half of the year looks like, never mind even the second quarter. And so based upon additions and the visibility we've got right now, we've communicated what we've gotten signed and closed and what we've gotten signed and yet to close. So I wouldn't want to even comment on anything around what future expectations would be, but when you think about quite typically on the public securities that we have, when you look at private equity, roughly about 30% of the remaining value is in public security, so to the extent that there is a rebound in the public market and those stock prices get to attracted enough levels where we already previously exited, you would expect to see us continue to do that again if the market is there. And again, as I said earlier, the one good thing about our model is we get to time our exits and so we will certainly time it appropriately.
Patrick Davitt: And are there restrictions on the Pfizer shares once it closes?
Craig Larson: Once the transaction closes there is a three month lock up on the shares, but that's the only contractual restriction. But I'd say Patrick, we expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year, so we'll be talking about that over the long-term, but I wouldn't expect any activity this year.
Patrick Davitt: Thank you.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have another follow up question from Robert Lee. Your line is now open.
Robert Lee: Great, thank you for taking my follow up. Maybe guys, just going back to kind of the pipeline of potential management fees, obviously you have 23 billion of dry powder, call it 230 million potentially of incremental fees, it is almost 20% of what you earned this year. But how about other pockets, for example, you now have a pretty big BDC platform of - I forgot the numbers, 14 billion, 15 billion or so leverage rules changed on that effective shortly going forward and - any thought about how you kind of adopted some of the change in leverage rules there? What incremental management fees potential could be over the next several years from just that pocket of assets?
William Janetschek: Hey, Rob, this is Bill. Nothing to call out specifically, what we did want to make clear and Craig mentioned this earlier is that we do have that 23 billion and so that's going to turn on probably over the next two, three, four years. But remember our business, if you follow the AUM growth over the past few years and the growth certainly more importantly as relates to management fees and the fee paying AUM growth, as we continue to raise capital and bring that capital online, you should hopefully expect with the challenge we've got, with more capital coming in for the alternative asset space, an increase in management fees.
Craig Larson: Yeah and the BDC pipeline, we'll let the management team for those entity speak for themselves on their call Rob, but you're right, there's latent potential there. But we'll let them articulate their leverage strategy.
Robert Lee: That was it. Thanks for taking my question.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to your speakers for any closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Okay, great. Thank you, Sydney and thank you everybody for joining us. Please of course follow us with anything as you reflect on the quarter. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Please begin, sir.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Norma. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. And the call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance, so please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning we announced a strong quarter with total segment revenues of $1.2 billion and after tax distributable earnings of $497 million, increases of 27% and 21% respectively year-over-year. Now, before we get into all of the numbers, this is also a notable quarter for us because it's our first as a C corp, having completed the change in our structure from a partnership to a corporation on July 1. To begin, the dialogue we're having with institutions continues to only reinforce in our minds what we felt for a long time, that the partnership structure was a real impediment for many investors, and the best path for us to broaden our appeal and ultimately maximize shareholder value was through our being structured as a mainstream equity security. We've traded on the New York Stock Exchange as a PTP for the better part of eight years, and at this point we've been trading as a C corp for only a handful of months. So we're in the earliest of innings but we're encouraged by the dialogue we've been having, and it feels to us like we're experiencing a transition in our shareholder base. We believe we're seeing an increase in the breadth of our shareholders, and the shareholders we're attracting are focused on the long-term opportunities we have to create equity value through a combination of earnings growth, asset growth as well as book value compounding. In short, it feels like we're attracting a shareholder base that thinks about our business and our stock more similarly to how we think about our business and our stock, and that's great to see. Also as part of this, we've seen some index buying. As of September 30 we're owned at roughly 12 index funds at Vanguard in addition to passive funds focused on S&P's Total Market Index. Total buying across these index funds in Q3, we believe, is in excess of 50 million shares. Returning to the results for Q3, please take a look at page 2 of the supplement. This morning we reported after-tax distributable earnings of $0.60 per share. Management fees reached $277 million in the quarter; that's up 19% year-over-year. And this growth, combined with the continued strong performance in Capital Markets, led to a strong fee-related earnings quarter which Bill is going to discuss in more detail. On the bottom half of the page you'll see that our book value per share on a marked basis was $16.68 per share as of September 30, representing 21% growth year-over-year. Strong performance in our core investment strategy and in our PE investments were the key contributors here. Now, as we've talked about on our calls historically, as we think about our performance there are five things that we need to do well. One, we need to generate investment performance; two, raise capital; three, find attractive new investments; four, monetize existing investments; and finally, five, use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet. I'll update you on the first two and Bill is going to cover the final three. Starting first with investment performance, please take a look at page 3 of the supplement. We've had strong investment performance across our asset classes over the last 12 months. In private equity our three flagship funds you see on the page have appreciated 19% on a blended basis, and our overall private equity portfolio appreciated 7.3% for the quarter and 19.9% over the last 12 months. Our real asset strategies are performing with our more mature Real Estate, Infrastructure, and Energy flagship funds up 10%, 11%, and 15%. And in credit, we continue to see strong performance particularly in our Mezzanine and Special Situations strategies. This performance has resulted in a 20% increase in the net accrued carry figure on our segment balance sheet on a year-over-year basis despite $1.3 billion of realized carried interest over this timeframe. Turning to fundraising. Over the last 12 months we've raised $38 billion organically with an additional $15 billion of inflows from both our partnership with FS Investments and an incremental 5% stake in Marshall Wace. Notably, all of our fundraising efforts these past 12 months have come from outside of what we historically defined as benchmark traditional private equity funds. We've seen our core investment strategy which consisted solely of our position in USI this time last year scale from $1 billion to over $10 billion of AUM today. The growth and scaling of many of our other newer strategies have continued as well. In Q3 we held the final close on our $7.2 billion Infra III Fund, over 2x the size of its predecessor. And over the last 12 months we've seen inflows in Real Estate II as well as several billion of new capital raised across our private and leveraged credit strategies. And our level of fundraising activity remains high. We're currently fundraising across our European private equity, impact, real estate credit, energy, and direct lending strategies with fundraising likely to be launched across an additional six carry-paying strategies over the coming months. Capital inflows over the trailing 12 months have contributed to $58 billion of dry powder at quarter end, up 22% year-over-year. And importantly, we also have $20 billion of capital commitments that become fee-paying when it's invested at a weighted average rate of around 100 basis points, providing direct line of sight for us towards future management fees. And with that, let me turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Craig. I'll start with the third thing we need to do well which is find new investment opportunities. This was an active deployment quarter for us. We invested $5.5 billion across businesses and geographies. Public Markets deployment was $1.6 billion coming primarily from investments made in our direct lending space. On the Private Markets side we invested $3.9 billion. The largest contributor was the carve-out of Unilever's Spreads business which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Other notable uses of capital include the acquisitions of Discovery Midstream and investment at both our Infrastructure and Energy funds and AppLovin out of Americas XII. The fourth thing we need to do well is monetize our existing investments. We are continuing to see significant monetization activity across our PE business. As stated in our September press release, exits were diversified between strategics and secondary activity. And on a blended basis, the PE exits were done at 3.4 times our cost. In total, realization events drove a 21% increase in cash carry since the second quarter. And finally, the last thing we need to do well was use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors. A great example of our model at work in the third quarter was our acquisition of Upfield, a carve-out of Unilever's Spreads business. This investment provided a compelling opportunity for our fund investors. We were the sole sponsor in this €7 billion enterprise value transaction that required approximately €2 billion of equity. KKR Capital Markets was instrumental in syndicating €1.2 billion of equity to third parties, and the team also helped underwrite and place the debt financing. Capital markets fees from Upfield alone were over $60 million in the quarter and helped contribute to the strongest quarter on record for our Capital Markets business. And we've announced two additional investments, BMC and Envision, which follow a comparable firm-wide approach. These transactions closed in the fourth quarter. And as such, the outlook for Capital Markets in Q4 is quite strong. Slide 4 highlights our fee-related earnings profile. AUM growth which in turn has led to management fee growth together with an active capital markets backdrop has led to a significant step up in our fee-related earnings. On an LTM basis we generated $970 million in fee-related earnings, representing a 26% increase compared to the prior period. And page 5 of the supplement summarizes our core fundamentals across the five categories. The power of our model is evident in our results and we are pleased with the progress and momentum we're seeing across the firm. Before I turn it over to Scott, I want to briefly touch on one additional item related to our hedge fund partnerships. Nephila, as you may recall, is a Bermuda-based investment manager specializing in catastrophic and weather insurance-linked securities and reinsurance-linked assets. In 2013 we acquired a 25% stake on our balance sheet. This past August we announced that Nephila is being fully acquired by Markel, a public specialty insurance company. Since our initial investment in 2013 Nephila's management team has done an excellent job growing AUM from $8 billion to $12 billion. Over this timeframe, our investment has also proved successful. The exit reflects roughly 3 times return on our investment and will allow us to book an attractive realized gain. While we'll be reflecting roughly a $3 billion outflow in our Public Markets fee-paying AUM as a result of the sale of Nephila, this will be partially offset by an incremental 5% ownership stake in Marshall Wace which we expect this to close in the coming weeks and which should contribute roughly $2 billion of Public Markets fee-paying AUM upon closing. Marshall Wace continues to be one of the premier hedge fund players in the world, so we're excited to enhance our stake and continue the strong partnership we formed with them. So in summary, please take a look at slide 6 which highlights the four metrics that we really believe matter: AUM, management fees, total distributable earnings, and book value per share. We feel we have a real opportunity to continue create and compound shareholder value substantially by enhancing each of these metrics which will be driven by investment performance and the efforts of our global team as they continue to collaborate and execute. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bill. As Craig and Bill discussed, we had a great third quarter and we're having an excellent year. Our returns have been strong. AUM is up 27% over the last 12 months and our book value per share has grown over 20%. Our model is working. But to many of you on the phone, I'm sure September 30 feels like an eternity ago, so I thought I would talk about the recent volatility and how we look at it. We tend to think in multi-year and decade increments, not daily or quarterly periods. Our business model allows us to do this. The public markets think in shorter increments, and in times like the last few weeks the disparity in our time horizon relative to the public equity market becomes incredibly obvious. So I want to tell you how we think about what's going on both from a business standpoint as well as our stock price. Over the last month the S&P 500 Index is down 9%, the Russell 2000 is down 14%. There's been a meaningful downward move. And stocks, including KKR in the alternative space, broadly have not been immune to this. Our stock is down about 20% over the last month. When we've been in periods like this, we're always surprised by the extent of the sell-off of our stock and space. To be clear, we don't think like the public markets think. In our view, our firm is worth more today than three weeks ago. Our business is very stable. We have locked up capital that's diversified across asset classes. About 80% of our AUM is contractually committed to us for eight-plus years at inception. And we have $58 billion of dry powder, an amount that is up 22% over the last 12 months. So we have a lot of capital to put to work and a lot of visibility on the management fee line. In our experience, volatility in the market is a good thing for our business because if you have $58 billion that is ready to be put to work, and that capital cannot be taken away from you, it's good news when things get cheaper. We can buy assets at lower valuations. In fact, in our 40-plus years of experience some of our best investments have been made in periods of dislocation and volatility in the public markets. We saw this coming out of the financial crisis a decade ago and more recently in Asia where we've increased our capital deployment into a volatile market and have a growing pipeline at attractive valuations. And we can also buy back our stock at lower prices. So from our seats, our stability is worth more today and the firm has even more opportunities and better prospects today than a month ago. And as we invest aggressively into dislocation, our company will have the opportunity to grow in value over the long-term at a faster pace than if valuations had not dropped. And as a reminder, our long-term incentives are aligned as employees of KKR own about 40% of the stock. We believe our stock will be worth more down the road because of what's going on, and we continue to be committed to equity value creation. So in our view, if the volatility continues we think our long-term value will be higher. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Norma, if we could ask everyone if they wouldn't mind to just please ask one question and then one follow-up if necessary. It'd be helpful as we work our way through everyone in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that's one question and one follow-up, please. Our first question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey. Good morning. Thank you. It looks like the LTM performance numbers are fine in credit but some of the balances on the balance sheet went down fairly significantly. Is there anything to point out from a credit stress standpoint there or is it really more about just selling some positions?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Patrick. It's Bill. If you're referring to page 9, it's a little bit of both there. There was some selling of the assets. But in Special Situations we had one position just on a mark-to-market basis written down in the quarter, but I wouldn't spend too much time highlighting that one particular area. When you look at the balance sheet itself, the balance sheet was up 5% for the quarter and 15% on a year-to-date basis. And when you look across all the other platforms that we're investing in the balance sheet, so we're talking about private equity and core and energy, real estate, infrastructure, performance in all those other assets were above benchmark So nothing to be worried about.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. And I guess just more broadly, particularly in the last few weeks obviously everyone is getting a little bit more worried about credit. When you look at your own portfolio, do you see any kind of broader deterioration or is it really just mark-to-market at this point?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Patrick. It's Scott. No broader deterioration. Actually, the fundamentals of the companies in our credit portfolio and our private equity portfolio continue to be strong. And actually in the liquid credit markets, we've seen some volatility come into high yield but the leverage loan market is actually quite stable. So no broader read-through as of yet that we'd be worried about.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. First question is you ticked off a number of things that you're going to be in the market for and I guess you said six other things that'll be coming down the pipe. I was wondering if you can maybe help quantify the opportunity set here collectively of how much incremental assets you might be able to bring on? A couple of your peers have sort of been bold enough to give specific guideposts in terms of what they think they can raise over a set period of time. I mean, just trying to frame out the incremental opportunity in terms of capital raising.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Bill. It's Craig. We don't have a specific number and specific guidepost to give you. I think the broad fundamentals as we think about the opportunity set is as we've described for some time. We think the industry as a whole is growing given a number of secular trends. Against that backdrop, we've taken share. And again, as we think about our businesses that we're in, most of them are younger and they're scaling. So that leads us to look and think we have a lot of meaningful growth opportunities relative to where we stand today, again just recognizing how young a number of those businesses are. And I think over the coming periods and other dynamic, we talked about our adjacencies as we think about opportunities for us in geographies like Asia. So I think there's a lot of good things to come but not a hard specific number to give you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I would point out, Bill, that last 12 months we've raised $38 billion organically without having a flagship private equity fund in the market. So we've been busy on a lot of different fronts.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No doubt. Okay. And then sort of a follow-up question, Scott, maybe for you. So you still highlighted both the volatilities and opportunity to both invest in companies as well as potentially buyback. Can you sort of frame that, how you're thinking about that dynamic, if you will, between maybe stepping in and buying stock here just under $23 versus the income opportunity to sort of grow either in public or private markets?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Sure. So I think, first, back on the volatility itself. The first thing I would point out is outside the U.S. we've already been in bear market territory. So the euro stock's 50%, down about 13% in the last 12 months. China is down about 20% and we've been increasing our deployment outside the U.S., Asia in particular this year. And so the way we kind of look at it is we've been investing into this location already and are pleased with that. And the good news is we're doing this at a period of time where we've got $58 billion of dry powder as I mentioned. And just to put that in context, that was about the total AUM of the firm in 2011. So we've got a lot of capital to put to work and a lot of cash on the balance sheet. But I think in terms of the buyback, as we said several times in the past, we're focused on and committed to making sure there's no dilution from compensation-related share insurance. And so I think what you should expect, Bill, all else equal, in periods of time when we see a dislocation like this on our own stock you should expect us to be more active in delivering on that promise than when the stock's higher, but no change in overall policy. But just directionally, you should expect us to be more active when we've got periods like this.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Bill, just a little more color on that and to drive on Scott's point about actually executing on what we said. We said specifically that we wanted to make sure that we didn't deal with share creep as it relates to share issuances to our employees. When we changed our distribution policy in 2015, the share count adjusted for Marshall Wace shares that we use for an acquisition were roughly $864 million. We issued shares at the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017 to our employees, and the share count today stands at $864 million.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Shares.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Is equivalent to 684 million (sic) [864 million] shares, yeah. And one other final point is keep in mind that we did authorize a buy back when we announced our conversion to C corp and we still have roughly $366 million of dry powder relating to that buy back.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hey, good morning everybody.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Morning.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So just maybe picking up on the question earlier from Patrick around direct lending and the trends you guys are seeing. So it feels like competitor dynamics are getting a little bit more intense. I guess I should say Franklin announced an acquisition of a middle market direct lending platform this morning. So I guess in the past you guys talked about playing and continue to move in kind of like the higher end of the direct lending market. So maybe speak a little bit to the differences between various kind of parts of the direct lending you're seeing, kind of where the industry is versus where you're deploying capital, and any metrics you guys could help us to think about your exposures within direct lending, i.e. like what's sort of the EBITDA run rate for some of the companies, leverage levels, interest coverage? Anything like that will be helpful just to get a sense how your business might be different.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Alex, it's Craig. Let me start and see if Scott has anything he wants to add. But, look, I think you're right. The overall dynamics within direct lending have changed. Money has come in and it's more competitive than it was a few years ago. But in our view, as you said, the place where it's become most competitive is in the lower end of the middle market where you really do have many, many firms that can be relevant, and these dynamics are different at the upper end which is our area of focus. And so things that are critical for us in this, broad origination capabilities both as it relates to corporates as well as third party sponsors. It's important to have multiple pools of capital to allow someone to be creative and offer a potential range of solutions when you're evaluating financing opportunities. And ultimately, the competitive dynamics are better because there aren't that many players that can be $250 million and greater as a sole lender. And as part of that, just as from a structure standpoint, in the investments we're making because you're right. Look, the investment decision is an underwritten approach as it relates to the investments, and structure is an important part of that. And as a lender, just to give you a sense, in our most recent direct lending fund, so the vast majority, almost 95% of the investments we've made, have true covenants, so that's leveraged and/or interest coverage. We're focused on equity cushion, call protections, and deleveraging mechanisms including hard amortization as well as excess cash flow sweeps. So the weighted average equity cushion in Direct Lending III is about 50%. The majority of these investments have excess cash flow sweeps and/or hard amor. So, again, the terms you see here really offer protection for us as a lender.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So I'd say, look, I think Craig captured it well, Alex. I think the other thing I would mention is we talk a lot about direct lending in private credit but we also have a fast-growing principal finance business as well where we're stepping into the void left by a bunch of banks pulling out of hard asset financing, and that's also a part of the platform that we're particularly excited about. So we continue to see opportunities on the large end of direct lending. Our average EBITDA for our Fund III, for example, in direct lending has been north of $100 million. If you go back to Fund I, it was closer to $50 million. So these companies are a lot bigger and, by virtue of their size, more diversified and in our view safer through a cycle.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up just around the exit backdrop, so accrued carry continues to actually grow very nicely. If the environment remains pretty choppy, I imagine it might be more difficult for you guys to exit in the public markets. But can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to monetize some of the investments in the private markets, whether it's through strategics or other private equity firms coming in, and just kind of any flavor of how we should think about the exit backdrop over the next quarter or two? Thanks.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Sure. Hey, Alex. This is Bill. I could just give you a little color about the fourth quarter. But as we stand here today, based upon transactions that have closed or signed transactions that have yet to close and may close either in the fourth quarter or possibly the first or second quarter of next year, although I would think that most of them would be occurring in the fourth quarter with some slippage into the first quarter – I'm giving you that caveat – the gross carry and the realized investment income combined right now as we stand here today is roughly about $580 million.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. One just thought for everybody is keep in mind, we have a majority of the investment professionals in our firm actually outside the United States. So I know there's a tendency especially for those of us in New York to focus on the U.S. markets but we actually have quite a global business. And so to the question on exits or kind of the overall environment, we've actually been operating in an environment in Europe and Asia where we've already seen a stock market pullback probably over the last several quarters in a lot of those markets. And even with that, we've seen significant monetization activity, so we don't sit here today with a very different perspective than we would've had three weeks, four weeks ago.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Right. And, Alex, just one final point. When you look at the assets that we have, just talking about PE, roughly a third of those assets are in public security. So to the extent that this volatility settles down and the market recovers over the next three months to six months, we will still have the ability to monetize that. And also, keep in mind, you mentioned the accrued carry which is shown on page 8 of the earnings release. Away from just private markets, we've got about $165 million of accrued carry on the public markets side. And you could see we had a small monetization this quarter which drove about $10 million, but we're optimistic that we're going to actually see some more monetizations come through our public markets side in the next couple quarters.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, very comprehensive. Thanks, guys.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Morning.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So just starting on capital markets fees, so we know they're included in fee-related earnings but they can be more cyclical than the management fees on locked up capital. So I just wanted to see like what type of volatility do you expect in these fees in the next down cycle, which maybe has already started, versus the underlying growth in the business and share gains that you expect?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Craig. This is Bill. I'll take just one and then if Scott or Craig wants to chime in later, feel free. But when you look at the Capital Markets business, it's hard to predict what that earnings base is going to be the next particular quarter. But as you did see in the supplement that we sent around with the press release, capital markets fees over the last four quarters were in excess of $100 million. You could see that the capital markets fee in this third quarter were quite significant and roughly $186 million, and I did mention that Unilever actually drove $60 million of that $186 million. We did give you a little bit of visibility in the fourth quarter about Envision and BMC and so we feel really comfortable that Capital Markets performance in the fourth quarter is going to be solid. But when you drill down, and what actually happened even in this third quarter, 60% of the economics came from equity, 40% came from debt, and the income generation of that $186 million came from 40 mandates. And the one thing that we were quite excited about with our Capital Markets arm is that when you look at where we started, in inception it was just based in the U.S. and specifically around KKR portfolio companies. That has grown to Europe and now they've grown to Asia and we've diversified into third party business. And so when you look at the year-to-date number for the third party business, again, it's a very large number year-to-date, still represents about 20% of the economics. And almost or probably more importantly, about 35% of the revenue from Capital Markets year-to-date is actually coming from outside the U.S. So that's a long-winded way of me telling you that the business is actually global and it's got a lot of reach both from KKR and KKR's portfolio companies plus the third party business. Again, the Capital Markets, the way it is each and every quarter, we don't have the stable fee base that we have vis-à-vis management fee. But we're pretty comfortable that it's quite a mature business and we're cautiously optimistic about the results prospectively.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Craig, hi. The way I would think about it is we have a lot of ways to win in capital markets. We've got our third party business and a lot of activity on that front working with other sponsors and corporates, and we're investing more in origination there. We've got the debt of our own private equity portfolio companies which we're always doing refinancings of some description virtually every week. We've got the equity that we own in our companies, both the public companies where we're doing secondaries and companies going public where we're in the IPO. We're scaling in non-PE, so if you look back a few years our Capital Markets business was almost entirely related to our PE business. But now we're working across credit, infrastructure, real estate. And to Bill's point, increasingly it's a global set of activities. And then on top of that, you do have the large deal dynamic across private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and energy where we do these syndications. So you're right; it's not contractual like a management fee. But what we found is by virtue of the breadth of activity and the fact that Capital Markets is integrated into everything we're doing around the world, on an outcome basis it's turned out to be quite steady around the world because we're just so busy somewhere in the world in any given quarter and it continues to scale in terms of just number of transactions.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And the good news is we have the ability now to get a lot of that back because we're so diversified.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Very comprehensive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Thanks very much. Just a little follow-up in private credit land. First is for Lending Partners II, can you remind us of what the hurdle rate is there and if there's anything that's weighing on performance that we should know? And then just a quick follow-up on Franklin Square.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Glenn. This is Bill. The hurdle rate is I believe 8%.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Got it. And then on Franklin Square, do you mind just reminding us sort of where are we now in the process on the combination? And then, are there funds that are in the pipeline that are going to be part of that fundraising over the next, say, six months that you talked about?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Glenn. It's Craig. So there is a proxy statement that's out as we think about CCT and FS, so I'd point you to that as it relates to that transaction specifically. And then more broadly, on the question about the opportunities for us, it's interesting and we've talked about this over time. We have a penchant to only have within our firm what really needs to be within the firm, and FS is a great example of how we can work with partners. So FS has built out a lot of capabilities and they have a few hundred people that spend their time focused on being best-in-class in administering, running, selling these more permanent type capital structures to an audience of hundreds of thousands of retail investors. I think we look at what they do and think they're better at that than we could ever be. So we partnered with them on the BDC front and we're talking with them about other products that we can create together over time where we can marry our two capabilities that we think can really be differentiated. So more to come on that over time but we do think that's a growth area for us.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. And is it fair to say that if you do expand in that space it'll be through that partnership?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: I think in terms of the private credit space, you should expect that we will continue to grow in partnership with Franklin Square both by expanding our existing vehicles and then over time launching new ones together. And to Craig's point, I think it's also going to be an opportunity for us to create non-private credit vehicles with Franklin Square, so we'll keep you updated but we are talking about, on an R&D basis, what else we can be doing together. But we will continue to have a private fund and SMA component of our private credit business as well. But if I'm looking at aggregate dollars, I'd say the majority is going to be through our Franklin Square partnership but we'll continue to be active on the private side as well.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And the benefit of that mandate, and you mentioned it earlier, is that for the most part this is permanent capital which is the best capital to have.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Amen. Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe one for you. Just with the recent volatility in the market and your comments in terms of the deployment opportunities, all that's helpful. Just wanted to get a sense, and we're in this type of backdrop, how you guys are thinking about like deploying capital and then also the current portfolio? And just kind of a couple of things if you want to touch on, maybe how you're thinking about underwriting if we go through sort of a recession at some point? Where we are in terms of the multiples on invested capital, the typical revenue, EBITDA trends? Anything on like entry multiples, leverage, how you're structuring it? And then, how the business plan can shift if you do get into that phase in terms of the portfolio companies focusing on maybe efficiencies versus growth? I know that's a lot, so whatever you want to hit on.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: I'll agree with you on that.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Look, all great questions. But I think let's just do a backdrop first. I mean, I think the comments from before, our feeling is that to some extent what we've seen in the last few weeks is the U.S. starting to catch up a little bit with the rest of the world. We've already seen a meaningful sell-off in China. We've seen the beginnings of some valuation changes in Europe. In the U.S., I think for us we've kind of been waiting for this to some extent. We're past the peak in earnings growth. At the same time, the Fed is tightening. And if you really just step back from it all, eight of the last eight times the Fed raised rates multiples in the U.S. markets peaked. So with all that happening at the same time, you got QE ending which is impacting risk assets; kind of liquidity starting to leave the system a bit; and margins being under pressure or at least the concern about it with wages, oil, rates, tariffs. All of this from our seat is kind of as expected, that we're starting to see a bit of an adjustment in the U.S. and starting to catch up a little bit with the rest of the world. But we shouldn't overdo it. I think the recency has an impact on all of us as people, but the S&P is up nearly 30% over the last two years. So we sold off quite a bit in the last few weeks but in the last couple years we've seen a meaningful uplift in value. But multiples, we think, have peaked and they're going to start to come back down, all else equal, and this is just kind of an expected beginning of that. We're excited about it. I mean, I think, as I said, we got nearly $60 billion to put to work plus the cash on the balance sheet, so I'd say our teams have been waiting for a valuation adjustment to make some assets that they really like more attractive. And we're hopeful there will be even more to do from a deployment standpoint going forward given that and then work with these assets and then monetize them over the long-term. But I'd say the presiding emotion here is excitement that the evaluations have started, maybe in the U.S., to come down a bit. In terms of your question about how we're underwriting, I think we've been underwriting for a while assuming everything that we're doing we're going to own through some kind of an economic slowdown. Because if you think about most of what we do, we're going to end up owning an asset or lending to a company through a several year period given where we are in the cycle. We've already been assuming we're going to own or lend through some kind of a recession, and we've been pricing transactions on that basis. To be clear, a lot of cases we're assuming that we exit at lower multiples than where we get in as an example. In terms of your questions on the portfolio, we have not seen a pullback in the fundamentals in our own portfolio. Our private equity and our credit portfolio revenue and EBITDA trends continue to be very attractive, kind of low double-digit revenue in EBITDA growth across the PE portfolio last 12 months as an example. And so I don't think it's really a material change in terms of what we're seeing in our portfolio nor a material change in how we're assessing companies. And in terms of efficiencies versus growth, we continue to focus on both. But a lot of what we're doing especially in PEs, we need to find assets we can make materially better, both growing the top line and oftentimes funding efficiencies. But really, through a cycle we find that top line opportunities are far more powerful in terms of creating returns for the people we work for. So it's a little bit of color and happy to take more offline but that gives you a sense.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: I'm just going to say, Mike, the one thing when I'm asked this question or when we're asked this question as often in the framework of private equity deployment, and it ties into this because when you look at our recent investment in Americas PE, our entry multiples today are actually lower relative to two years ago, and that's interesting. And I think the reason you're seeing this is because there is a different risk reward in those investments, and in many ways we're buying into complexity, we're not buying into growth, and you see this in some of our larger transactions. Bill talks about the Unilever transaction. It was complicated. We have a global team as we evaluated that. Envision is an investment where we're going to be focused together with management on a series of operational improvement opportunities. And in BMC, again, the mainframe industry, it's an industry with complexity. So we're leaning into complexity, we're focused on opportunities where we can bring expertise to help reposition an investment. And if you then also think about – if we had to bucket the areas where we've been particularly active, we'd point to corporate opportunities. So whether it's through our portfolio companies, pursuing M&A where there can be real synergies. We announced a pretty significant investment this week in the auto parts industry through which Calsonic, which is one of our portfolio companies, is going to acquire Magneti Marelli from Fiat; it's a great example of this. And we've talked previously about transactions involving Internet brands: Air Medical, PharMerica; again, all examples of working with a portfolio of companies that can fit in this category. Carve-outs, again, that can be complicated. Upfield we acquired earlier in 2018. Two businesses out of a large, diversified corporation in South Korea as well as the activity we've talked about in Japan. So I think in an environment like we're in, those are examples of areas and themes where you'd see us be trying and leaning into the opportunity.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for all the color.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. So we've already touched on Asia a little bit. Wondering if you guys might be able to share your perspectives on what you're seeing economically in that part of the world. The stock market seemed to be indicating that things are pretty bad, so curious to hear what you guys have to say. And then related to that, you've already mentioned that you're not really seeing too much weakness or any weakness in your portfolio in the aggregate. But what about Asia specifically? Are you seeing any sort of weakness for some of those investments that are already in the ground there?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Chris. It's Scott. So I think Asia is really hard to talk about as a monolith given all the countries, so let me try to do a quick kind of spin with you. So we've been particularly active the last few years in Japan. And it's not because the Japanese economy we think has an extraordinary amount of opportunity in the near-term; it's more because we've seen corporates in Japan start to be comfortable selling non-core subsidiaries. And so a lot of the activity you've seen, and it really started with our Panasonic Healthcare transaction, has been around us to incorporate carve-outs from large scale companies in that country. And then, what we've been doing, and we've done this twice in a very visible way now, is to help those companies post-carve-out go global. So Panasonic Healthcare, we did an acquisition of Bayer's Diabetes business in Germany, and then we just announced this transaction Craig just referenced with Calsonic and Fiat. So the companies in Japan continue to operate as expected, no change. Kind of the ability to get out efficiencies and drive growth is as expected. And the global opportunity expansion in terms of cross-border M&A we think is real, so no change to the question in terms of recent views and the big opportunity we think ahead as there's thousands of non-core subs in that country and we're just starting, we think, to scratch the surface on the opportunity. China is another place that we're quite active. Keep in mind, where we have focused in China has historically been largely focused on the growth of the consumer and the spending power of the individual. So if you look at what we've done, it's been things in technology. We've been busy increasingly in healthcare as of late. And so those companies so far we have not seen a meaningful change in how they're performing. And in fact, we've had quite a busy deployment year in China over the course of the last 12 months; hospital roll-ups, tech in particular. And so we continue to be active in China. We've got a portfolio of over 20 companies in that part of the world. And the performance, a bit weaker than what we've seen but nothing that I would call out as causing us any real concern. The other trends that we see there, food safety, environmental safety, continue to be real opportunities for us. Australia is another active market, no meaningful change. Southeast Asia, a market with a lot of growth opportunity for us, no meaningful change.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys. Your line is open – of Morgan Stanley.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the CLO market, you guys are active in that space and the market has broadly seen tremendous growth from CLOs across the industry. But just some concerns are manifesting around equity buyers potentially stepping away and concerns around weakening terms and higher use of leverage. Just curious to hear your perspective on what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what your perspective is on that, and how your underwriting criteria has evolved over the past 12 months to 24 months in the context of the CLO market? Thanks.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Great. Happy to take it. So you're right. We continue to be active in the CLO market in both the U.S. and Europe. Our issue has not been around equity buyers stepping away so much because remember, we tend to use our balance sheet to retain a decent portion of the equity in our own CLOs. So we have heard that but we haven't seen a big impact on our business from equity buyers stepping away. I think the bigger thing that we're focused on is your second point around how does the math work right now in terms of creating new CLOs and are the returns for the equity attractive given the spread between asset returns and liability cost. And so for example, we have been very busy this year U.S. and Europe. The math has become less compelling in the very recent past but it doesn't change our thinking in terms of our ability to scale that business over the long-term. We think it's a bit of a transitory shift. We've been issuing $2 billion to $3 billion worth of CLOs a year and our expectation is that we'll continue to do that.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And just a little more color on that. Away from the CLOs that we're actually raising, over the last 12 months to 18 months we've been doing a lot of refinancing and resets. And when you do a reset you actually get to extend the maturity, so you actually get a little more economics out of a CLO that has already been raised.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, circling back to your comment on the principal finance business that you guys have, I'm just hoping you could just talk more about the opportunity set that you see? If you could just help us – remind us size, where your business is today, how you're building it out, and where you see this going over the next couple of years?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Great. Happy to take that. So the principal finance business is largely funded for us out of two pools, one is our Principal Credit Opportunities Fund which we call PCOF and then also we make these investments sometimes also on our BDC platform. So the high level is that what we found, and it really started in Europe and is now kind of expanding into the U.S., is that there are a number of hard assets, types of hard assets that were historically funded by banks, European banks in particular. And with the banks pulling back, there was an opportunity to invest into businesses that were lending to these markets. But as opposed to going to invest into a company that has a legacy balance sheet and a legacy portfolio that we needed to worry about, to a very large extent what we've been doing is creating new principal finance platforms. So we've created a better part of 10 specialty finance companies where we'll invest the equity, work with the management team, and create deal flow for that entity and then work with the company to finance that deal flow and create a balance sheet for that new enterprise. And so our team has been very active doing that across a number of different spaces, everything from construction lending in Ireland to auto lending in the U.S., UK; to the housing market, and so we've been quite busy there. We haven't spent a lot of time talking about it in the past but we've been just working away building this platform out and we think we've got the beginning of something quite special. So it's a business that we think we can grow over time because we continue to see that this space, as opposed to some of the other spaces we've talked about today, has yet to attract large scale capital and so we continue to be quite active.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.

Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Valerie. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO, and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call that are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. Beginning first on page 2, this marks our first earnings call since our July 1 conversion from a partnership to a corporation as well as since our July 9 Investor Day. We know many of you did join for Investor Day and we thank you for that. For those of you that might be newer to KKR, we would encourage you to review the webcast presentation or the presentation and the transcript itself, all of which are available on our website. There's a wealth of information across all of those materials. Let's turn now to pages 3 and 4 of the supplement. Page 3 shows a summary of our four key metrics since 2013, while page 4 provides more specificity around these figures for the quarter, as well as on a trailing 12-month basis. Let's begin with page 3. We continued to see strong underlying trends across the firm. From our perspective, the alternative sector continues to grow and we're continuing to take share. Beginning in the top left-hand pane, AUM is up 29% year-over-year, reaching $191 billion. This growth in underlying assets is driving the continued growth in our management fees, as you see in the top right-hand corner of the page, and for the trailing 12 months, management fees reached $980 million. And behind strong performance, our book value per share on a marked basis was $15.59 as of June 30. This is a 10% increase over the first six months of the year compared to the MSCI World, which appreciated less than 1% over the first six months of the year. And these statistics, as we've noted previously, are particularly important as they're the ones that are ultimately going to drive the earnings power of the firm looking forward and all are record figures for us as a public company. In terms of our after-tax distributable earnings, looking at the bottom right-hand chart, we reported $1.4 billion over the trailing 12 months. The trends that you see here really reflect two things. First, in the early years, we saw meaningful gains as legacy balance sheet co-investment holdings were realized. You see this dynamic in the top lighter-shaded portion of the bars that show realized investment income, and is most pronounced, as you see, in 2013 and 2014. And second, as we discussed in some length during Investor Day, a number of the businesses that we've created are relatively young, so we have (03:46) dollars in the ground with a carry right, and they're continuing to season, continuing to mature. So, we're under-earning our carry potential and our distributable earnings potential as a firm as that happens. In our view, longer term, the growth opportunity we have, given this backdrop, is a compelling one. Let's look at more of the details on page 4. So, for the quarter, this morning we reported after-tax distributable earnings of $405 million or $0.49 on a per adjusted share basis. Comparably, this is $0.29 in Q1 and $0.34 in Q2 of 2017. And on an LTM basis, after-tax DE came in at $1.4 billion or $1.73 per adjusted share. Management fees reached $261 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. This growth, combined with an active quarter in our Capital Markets business which Bill's going to talk about shortly, led to a strong fee related earnings quarter. We reported FRE of $231 million for the quarter and $883 million on an LTM basis. FRE, similarly, is also up 14% year-over-year. Our fee paying AUM reached $139 billion as of June 30, up 23%. And in terms of our distribution, we've announced our final $0.17 distribution for the second quarter as a partnership. As we highlighted during our call last quarter, as a corporation, we expect to pay an annualized dividend of $0.50 per share, and this will begin in the third quarter. Stepping back as we evaluate our performance more broadly, there are really five things that we need to do well. We need to generate investment performance, raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments, and use our model to capture more economics across everything that we do. I'll update you on our progress on the first two, and Bill's going to cover the remaining three. In terms of investment performance, let's look at page 5 on the supplement, we've had continued strong performance across our asset classes over the last 12 months. In private equity, our three flagship funds appreciated 20% on a blended basis. And our overall private equity portfolio appreciated 6.7% for the quarter, and 17.5% over the last 12 months. Our real asset strategies are performing as well, with our more mature real estate, infrastructure and energy flagship funds up 8%, 14% and 12%, respectively. And in credit, we saw strong performance in our special situations and mezzanine funds, in particular. Turning to fundraising, in the second quarter, our AUM increased to $191 billion, driven by the closing of the FS transaction. And over the last 12 months, we've raised $40 billion organically driven by core, infrastructure, real estate, private credit, as well as our strategic investor partnerships. All told, the majority of this new capital came from non-PE strategies and it's attractive, is largely all performance fee eligible. In terms of our fee paying AUM, the FS transaction contributed $13.2 billion of new fee paying AUM, and that's reflected in the Public Markets segment. And capital inflows over the quarter helps contribute to the $57 billion of dry powder that we have as of quarter-end. And also of note, we have $19 billion of LP capital commitments that become fee paying on an as-invested basis at a weighted average rate of approximately 100 basis points. This provides direct line of sight towards future management fee growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Craig. I'll start with the third thing we need to do well, which is find new investment opportunities. We invested $4.6 billion across the firm and across geographies during the second quarter. Of the $4.6 billion, Public Markets deployment was $2 billion with the majority coming from our direct lending strategy. On the Private Markets side, we invested $2.6 billion. The largest contributor was a new core investment, Heartland Dental. We also deployed approximately $0.5 billion in other private equity strategies with two-thirds of that focused in Asia. Shifting to monetizations, we continue to see a sizable level of exit activity across our PE business. This led to $342 million of realized carried interest for the quarter. As I mentioned in Investor Day, this quarter we completed a number of strategic sales and secondaries. On a blended basis, these PE exits driving realized carry were done at three times our cost. I would also like to highlight that our realized investment income for Q2 was $169 million. This income was driven by several secondaries and strategic sales, together with dividend and interest income. And finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, Capital Markets and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. This was another active quarter for KCM, with just over $100 million in transaction fees. As Adam Smith and others on our team noted in Investor Day, the breadth and depth of KKR Capital Markets has continued to expand. And a number of case studies were reviewed that highlighted how we use our model to capture more of everything we do. Our acquisition of Upfield, a carve-out of the spreads division of Unilever, is the latest example of this. We were the sole sponsor in this €7 billion enterprise value transaction that required approximately €2 billion of equity. KKR Capital Markets was instrumental in syndicating €1.2 billion of equity to third parties, as well in helping to underwrite and place the debt financing. This model is powerful. It allows the firm to create more economics by facilitating transactions. The economics of the Upfield transaction will be reflected in our Q3 financials. We have announced two additional investments, BMC and Envision, which follow a similar framework. These are expected to close in the back half of the year. We expect Q3 to be another strong quarter for KCM. Page 6 of the supplement summarizes our core fundamentals across the five categories. The power of our model is evident in our results, and we are pleased with the progress and the momentum we're seeing across the firm. And finally, two clarifying items; first, as we discussed on last quarter's call and at Investor Day, the after-tax DE number we reported, $405 million, does not include the impact of $729 million of one-time losses. These losses were realized in relation to the conversion. Recognizing the loss in Q2, we'll save our shareholders cash taxes that they would have had to pay on flow-through income as we were still a partnership at the time of recognition. And as a reminder, these losses have already been reflected in prior quarters in book value and have no meaningful impact on cash. And second, let me spend a minute on Infra. Infra III entered its investment period at the end of Q2. So, the fund is additive to fee-paying AUM this quarter, but there is no management fee. We expect the final close to be in Q3 at approximately $7 billion of LP capital. In total, this will lead to management fee uplift of approximately $80 million on an annual basis and, again, beginning in Q3. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Bill. And thank you, everyone, for not only joining the call today, but also for joining our Investor Day earlier this month. We enjoyed taking a deeper dive into our business with you. Given the detailed nature of those presentations, I'm going to keep it short today, and reiterate the four key takeaways on page 7 that Joe and I discussed at Investor Day. One, our industry is growing and we're taking share. The alternative asset management industry is large, and has been growing at double-digit rates over the last 10 years. Within that very attractive industry dynamic, we're taking share, driven by diversification of both products and geographies. We're growing our assets under management at over 20% in a market that's growing 12%. Two, our model of third-party AUM plus balance sheet plus Capital Markets is differentiated from our peers. As Bill mentioned earlier when he hit on KCM's growth and specifically the Upfield example, our unique model gives us the opportunity to create and compound shareholder value substantially and sustainably. Three, many of our businesses are young, inflecting and they operate in large end markets. Our U.S. private equity business is our one mature business, with most of our businesses started in the last 10 years. This points to significant and global opportunities for growth with scale benefits. Infrastructure's a great example of this, with our infra fund growing from $1 billion to $3 billion to $7 billion over the past seven years. And finally, we're committed to equity value creation. Our alignment of interest is absolute, as KKR employees own or control about 40% of our stock. We believe our recent change to a C-Corp is an important milestone for unlocking that value. Although it's still very early, we're pleased with the significantly increased dialogue around our stock, and we're enjoying building relationships with a broader group of investors. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Just before we begin with questions, if we could ask everyone to ask one question and then one follow-up, that would be helpful for us in making sure we work our way through the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. It's Ben Herbert on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the Capital Markets business and with the BDC now in the fold, are we at kind of a stepped-up run rate going forward, kind of putting to side Unilever spreads, BMC and Envision Healthcare in the second half here?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: This is Bill Janetschek. That's hard to predict. It's a Capital Markets business. So, Capital Markets is driven by the activity of the firm. And so, again, we're not going to be able to predict what the income would be a quarter out or two quarters out as it's a dynamic business.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: And the only thing I'd say, Ben, is that with Franklin Square's capital in-house on the private credit side, we can now make even larger underwritings and we think be even more competitive at the large end where we think the risk/reward is particularly attractive. And we do think all else equal it will allow us to have even more third-party syndication fee revenue coming out of Capital Markets. And you're right to point to the large private equity transactions we've announced, but that's a bit separate from what we're doing in Franklin Square.
Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then maybe the follow-up would be, I didn't see the aggregate PE portfolio accretion in the release this quarter. Would you mind providing that metric?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Ben. It's Craig. So, I had mentioned just in the remarks the numbers were – it was 6.7% for the PE portfolio as a whole for the three-month period.
Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, first just on Infra III, given that this fund will be more than two times the size of II with the upcoming final close, how long do you think it could take to deploy this fund? And can you provide us a quick update on the investing backdrop for infrastructure?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Craig. This is Bill Janetschek. As it relates to Infra II going to Infra III, we will be investing in Infra III starting into third quarter. We've already got a signed deal that is not yet closed, and we'll be putting the money to work. When you look at the infrastructure platform and you look historically at the pace of deployment for Infra I and Infra II, you could size that time period is anywhere between three to five years.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Craig, just on the backdrop and the opportunity set, I think it's interesting when you reflect back on 2017 more specifically. We syndicated more capital than we invested in our funds, and it wasn't because we didn't like the investment, it was because we felt undersized against what's really just an enormous opportunity. And I think as we look at deal flow today and the opportunity set, again, it's just an enormous opportunity that we're excited about over the long term.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And you could put some numbers around that, when you look at where we are today, signed but not yet closed transactions for infrastructure, looking out probably over the next three months is going to be roughly about $600 million of equity.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And just as my follow-up, and I know I just asked this kind of two weeks ago, but I want to see if there's been any update. What are your thoughts on adjusting corporate governance and putting a small amount of voting rights into the float in order to qualify for the Russell 1000 next year?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Look, Craig, so we're in the very early days as it relates to where we are as a C-Corp, and we'll have an opportunity to evaluate that in the spring of next year, and we'll see where we are and we'll keep everybody updated. As I'd said, as I think about the opportunity for us to expand shareholders, I think – I put them in three buckets, I think there's a great opportunity for us to expand our penetration within those firms that know us, but we're only appropriate for a fraction of the assets within those complexes. The second of those are new investors and the new opportunities, and it continues to feel to me like we're only scratching the surface as it relates to that opportunity. And then, the third piece of that really relates to the passive opportunity. We've sized that amount as we think at least 20 million shares initially, and again we'll see how we progress over time. But to me the real driver, I think, is actually going to be in the first two of those buckets as opposed to the third.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Craig.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey, good morning. Thank you. We saw some pretty significant declines in some of the credit-related balances on the balance sheet. Is that just deals rolling off? Or is there some negative mark issues going on? And in that vein, could you kind of – yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Sorry.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: This is Bill Janetschek. The good news is it's just a rotation out of the 1.0 CLO book into the 2.0 CLO book. And so, a couple of the older CLOs, recall where we had (20:21) more equity invested and so you'll actually see a decline of roughly $90 million, but that has nothing to do with the performance. As a matter of fact, the CLO portfolio was up on the balance sheet about $20 million this quarter.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Could you give kind of a broader update of the credit performance within the quarter, not just the LTM?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Sure. When you look at special sits, direct lending, mezzanine, CLOs, leverage credit, all of those categories that make up the credit total that you're referring to on page 9, when you look at the quarter and for the first six months of the year, most of those strategies are actually performing well above benchmark. And so, we're quite pleased with the performance of our credit portfolio, in our funds and on our balance sheet.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: I think, Patrick, if you were to look at the high yield index, the HFRX special sits index and the LSTA, both for the quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis, the blended balance sheet performance over both those periods is ahead of all three of those.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Patrick, before you ask a question because you're talking about just credit, if you take a look at all of the platforms on our balance sheet for the quarter and for the first six months, all of those platforms are up.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Disdier of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: (21:50) through the investment period.
Operator: One moment, please.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Hello?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Sorry, Andrew. We missed that.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Sorry. So, it was nice to see Infra III enter the investment period, but did notice that there were two other funds that exited their investment period, one being Global Infra the II. And then, I guess looking out into 2020 have a number of other funds having the same dynamic, particularly the Euro IV. So, I guess the questions are, one, why did Global Infra II go from an ending investment period of October 2020 at the last prior update? And then, two, will this dynamic occur with Euro Fund IV and V?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: It all depends on the pace of deployment in our funds. So, when we report, in the fund table we show the beginning period and the ending period. And depending on the fund life cycle, some are three, some are four, some are six years. With Infra II, we deployed that capital quicker than the investment period, which is good news. To Craig's earlier point, we saw a lot of opportunity in infra over the last couple of years. And we wish we had a bigger fund, because we could have actually deployed more capital. As it relates to Euro IV going to Euro V, what'll typically happen is once you get about two-thirds through the investment period where at a certain point in time you're about 65% invested, that's when you actually go out and start raising capital for that next fund. And so, that is the case with Euro IV rolling into Euro V.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: To be clear, this is all good news, right? Because new fund turns on, old fund's still paying us fees based on remaining invested capital, so it's a net increase in our fee revenue from this dynamic.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. Yeah, wasn't sure if there was an LP dynamic or something else we missed, but understood.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah, normal course.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Cool. In the comp forecast of low-40% in the hope that it can come down over time, could you help us think about some of the assumptions driving that ratio? So, as I think about some of the revenue and expense components, are there realized investment income assumptions being high-margin money? Are there kind of those dynamics going on within that broader assumption of low-40%? So, just wondering if you're incorporating a stepped up realization rate.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: What we're trying to do is keep the model simple. We have three revenue streams, and we have one compensation load. And what we've said certainly over the last several quarters and we highlighted this at Investor Day is we're focused on keeping that comp number across all of that revenue in low-40s. And when you take into account occupancy and G&A, which usually trends anywhere between 8%, 9%, we've talked about having our operating earnings roughly at 50%. And so that's what we've communicated certainly over the last several quarters. That's what we've actually reported over the last several quarters, and that's what we expect to show prospectively.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: So, there's not realized gain expectation embedded within that statement. You should expect us to be in the low-40s. That's really what we're telling you kind of as an absolute measure, almost regardless.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: And we don't – Andrew, it's Craig. I'd just say as a final point on page 4, we do note when you look at compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues, it was 40% for Q2 as well as over the trailing 12 months.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Yes. Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. Hey, Bill, just on the outlook, I think you mentioned for KCM the back half looks good. I might have missed it, but did you say anything on, like, the realizations for the third quarter or just the outlook for the second half?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: No, Michael. I haven't given that number yet, but I knew it was coming. And so, right now as we stand here today, based upon those investments that have been realized or those we expect to realize, and remember we're only three weeks into the next quarter, we're at $175 million of gross realized investment income and gross realized carry.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: And as a reminder, Michael, we're going to give you an update on that as we get through the quarter as things progress.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. Okay. And, Bill, maybe just one more on that. So, I think on the fund side, we have pretty good visibility when we look at performance and kind of seasonality on some of the products. Just when we think about the balance sheet and where it's invested and where maybe some of the returns are, is there any way for us to be thinking about that over, say, the next 12 months in terms of how much that can contribute to the – relative to maybe the past three years. Like, is it – should be similar? Or has kind of the mix or the profile changed much?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Michael, it all depends on performance and a little bit depends on realization, but probably the simplest way to model this is if you go to page 9, we highlight the categories of those investments on the balance sheet and you can make your own assumptions as to what the rate of return is. But you could assume that so goes our funds, so goes our balance sheet. Most of the capital that we're investing in the balance sheet is also in the fund. And so, you would expect in private equity that those investments would be sold on a run rate of, say, every five years. Credit is obviously more accelerated. So, we can't give you a very specific answer, but generally speaking, nothing different.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Now that with FS in the run rate in the second quarter, could you guys spend a minute, I guess, on how you're thinking about growing this specific franchise? I know it's kind of part of the whole direct lending platform, but we're kind of just zoning in on this (28:21) part specifically, how are you thinking about growing this part of the business?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah, I guess there's really two ways to answer that, Alex. First is FS obviously brings to us a significant expansion of our private credit platform, which also feeds our third-party Capital Markets business. So, I think in the first instance what we're focused on doing is deploying that incremental capital well and as I mentioned, going out and really leaning into situations that we like. So, you'll see us financing larger companies where we think the risk/reward is more attractive, and that's allowing us and we've seen it already even though we just closed not long ago, we've seen already the ability to step up for larger transactions, which also feeds the syndication machine. So, so far so good. It's also allowing us to think about how do we further expand the platform around private credit with our partners at FS, how can we create incremental BDC capacity in partnership with them and that also allows us to also scale our private funds business alongside. So, I think we kind of went from number eight to number one or two in private credit globally, and scale begets scale in that business and I think it feeds both AUM and Capital Markets fees. But the second way to answer your question is around what it does for us in retail. Franklin Square, obviously, has a history of distributing to the retail investor. It just so happens our partnership with them today is focused on the BDC channel and private credit, but we think there are many opportunities for us to expand outside of private credit with our new partners. And so, we're talking about a variety of different product areas where we can create vehicles together to broaden our retail presence in partnership with them. So, it really is both on credit and on retail, and in addition obviously expanding materially our permanent capital. So, it's got a lot of different dimensions to it.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. And then second, Bill, just a nitpicky question, I guess, but if I look at the interest expense came down a little bit sequentially. I wasn't sure whether it's currency or something else related. But maybe just an update on what the run rate should be going forward?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: It's approximately where it is. The nit-nat is, remember we had some debt on our capital structure that got refinanced. I don't know what you're looking at, but if you're looking at 2017-2018 that it'd be the subtlety. But again, when you think about the number that you're seeing in the second quarter, it should be approximately that number.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Great. Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Rob.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Maybe a little bit of a modeling question but, Bill, any kind of additional color on how we should think about the effective tax rate ramping with the – you get the step up in basis and we know it's going to ramp over a multiyear period. But any additional color what we should be thinking balance of this year into next year at least?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Right now no change in thought from when we had this conversation on the last quarter call. Right now we say that the tax rate was roughly 7% and over time will grow to 22%. We do have these tax benefits by stepping up assets on the balance sheet and our carry as well as having a goodwill number that we're going to be able to amortize over a 15-year period. And you could see that in this quarter, but remember it's just this quarter. The effective tax rate was really actually even lower, it was about 4%. But you should think of when you're modeling this for anywhere in-between 7% starting in the third quarter, which should migrate to 10% probably throughout the next fiscal year. But again, if anything happens to the assumptions that we have that change that, we'll certainly communicate that before we actually have to tell you why it's happened.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And maybe this is another little modeling question as a follow-up. With the BDCs and kind of Part 1 fees (32:47), some of your peers include that in management fees. I believe your intention is to include that in incentive fees. I just want to make sure I have that correct.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: That is correct. Right now we're showing true management fees in that line, and we're showing the incentive fees in that separate line. And that's why you could see, if you look into page 7, you'd see actually incentive fees in 2018, both for the quarter and for the first half of the year, higher than what we reported. And a lot of that has to do with Franklin Square coming on board.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. That was all I had. Thanks.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Chris Harris from Wells Fargo has our next question.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Now that DE is the primary earnings metric, I'm just curious if there's an accounting requirement that you guys need to abide by in regards to when you need to realize losses. Or is that really completely under your discretion?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: That is completely under our discretion.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. In regards to the realized losses for Q1, I know we've already talked about these, but can you go into a little bit more detail? Were these investments that were almost pretty much like written off, or were these some investments that you actually monetized, so still had some value? You've just kind of taken a loss from where you originally acquired them.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Right. You refer to Q1, but I think you meant Q2.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Oh, sorry. Q1, yeah.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: And what we did from a planning perspective is that we had several investments, mostly in energy and credit, that over the course of several years had been written down significantly. There was really no opportunity for any increase in value, and so from a planning perspective, we took the opportunity to sell these investments and recognize that loss. And it's nothing other than that, but again the whole premise around this was around just tax planning.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: And, Chris, I know we've talked about this, but again those are already recognized in the market to book value per share as that's been reported over time. No cash impact, et cetera.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Right.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Understood. Okay. Thanks for clarifying.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Michael?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Valerie, let's go to the next question, I guess.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. One moment.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hello?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Michael.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Or is this Devin?
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: This is Devin Ryan. I didn't get queued in here.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Devin.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. They didn't call my name here. But first question is on the roughly $60 billion of AUM that is at or above cost, but it's (36:00) not yet paying carry interest. I love to just get any sense from you guys if you can on how far away you are from carry generating, if you can give us any of kind of the main buckets there. Any more order of magnitude would be helpful.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Sure. And what you're referring to is something that we called out certainly at Investor Day for those of you who weren't at Investor Day or have read that presentation. But the punch line is we have a lot of investments that have been investing for just a few years. And so, all of these platforms are relatively new, like healthcare growth and TMT growth. And it's going to take some time to actually see the fruits of the labor as we ramp up those platforms. And in addition, let's not forget, in that AUM number now the large flagship funds like North America XII and Asia III, where we've got significant capital to deploy and then have that monetization. And so, when you look at the – and this would be for reference – on page 218 in the investor presentation, this is something we're really excited about, because what we're trying to drive home is that 25% of the AUM is driving 91% of the realized performance income. And so, when you look at all the other categories, where to use a baseball analogy and not a hockey analogy, we are talking about being in early innings in these strategies. And so, we're really excited about it.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: But I'd say some of these – it's not like it's years out, some of this is relatively imminent, and we're actually starting to see realizations out of several of those vehicles on that page. So, it's not something that you're going to have to wait years for. Some of this is coming quite soon.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Yeah. That's really helpful. And it was kind of good disclosure. And then, I guess the follow-up here is another kind of high-level modeling, and from the Investor Day I think you guys laid out a pretty compelling case as to why industry growth should remain elevated and then why KKR can continue to take share and grow at a faster pace than the industry. And so, as I play this out and kind of think it through kind of the longer-term model, what's the assumption on fee yields, like in aggregate? Do they hold the line? If not, why? And I guess I'm just trying to kind of think through some of the moving parts of the balance between kind of a mix shift in assets versus also the dynamic of just fee yields on kind of successor funds as those obviously should be getting bigger over time here.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: So, Devin, I think the way you should think about it is, we have not – as long as we have performance, we have not seen meaningful fee compression on an apples-to-apples basis. So, if it's a longer-term, more opportunistic strategy, we really haven't seen a lot of compression in our business. Where we have, and we talked about this before, agreed to reduce fees as if we get serious scale from investors or serious longevity. So, some of these recycling strategic partnerships, but the aggregate revenue outcome's greater. As we mentioned in Investor Day, we see growth opportunities across the firm. We mentioned several of our different platforms that we've created in the last 2 to 10 years where we think we can double, triple, quadruple, or more from a growth standpoint. And as we look at the opportunity set, we think it is significant virtually everywhere we look, but we are not looking at it saying for every dollar of capital we raise, we're going to have to think about big fee pressures. I think you will see a little bit of mix. I mean, obviously if we raise leveraged credit capital, that comes in at a lower fee than healthcare growth capital. But ignoring the mix changes over time, we see a lot of opportunities for growth in the fee line. And we'll keep you posted as we see the capital-raising progress across different strategies. So, within this strategy, no real change. It's really a question of how quickly do we grow different pieces.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: And then, Devin, I appreciate the question and the way you framed it in terms of the long term. Just for specificity to highlight, in this quarter you would have seen that blended fee rate actually tweak down marginally in private markets. And the dynamic you saw there actually relates to infrastructure most specifically where we had all of that AUM turn on at June 30, but we didn't have any of the management fees over the course of the quarters. So, again, appreciate the long-term answer, but just wanted to highlight that as it related to the quarter itself.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Thank you, guys.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me now?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: We can.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co., Inc.: Hey, Mike.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, Scott, just wanted to follow up on your point you were making earlier on the alternative industry growing over the past decade. Just curious, as you think about that, how much of that growth do you think is secular versus cyclical given the dynamics at play over the past decade with QE? And as you look forward from here and interest rates continue to rise, how do you think about any sort of risk that demand for alternatives softens in a higher interest rate environment?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: That's a good question, Mike. But, look, I think what we've seen and it's not just been since the crisis, we obviously saw good growth in the industry pre-crisis as well. I think it is definitely a secular shift as opposed to a cyclical one. And, well, it's been not just, as you know, the traditional longer-term investors in alternatives, there's been a serious expansion of the pools of capital that invest in alternatives on a global basis. So, we've seen dramatic growth, we've talked a lot about sovereign wealth funds, more recently insurance and retail, but also high-net worth investors and family offices. And so, the types of investors have grown materially. We do not think that's a cyclical phenomenon, we think that's a secular one. And they are focused on asset allocation and it has really become a big part of the conversation of how much of a portfolio should be invested in alternatives. That was not nearly as predominant part of the conversation 10, 15 years ago. And we don't think that's going to shift based on what happens with interest rates. And if you think, there's a lot of things that we do that are somewhat tied to interest rates. Look at our private credit platform as an example, that's a LIBOR-plus return stream. There's a lot of things that we're doing that actually benefit as rates go up, and we've had that conversation with investors. They see it's an illiquidity premium, but it's a premium to a floating rate. So, the short answer is we think it's secular and we have only seen it strengthen. And as rates have started to move, there's been no abatement whatsoever.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Just as a follow-up question on private credit, just given that it's getting later cycle, how do you think about building out that part of the business at this point in the cycle? And if the cycle were to turn, if we do go through a credit downturn cycle, how do you see that playing out across the industry in terms of the private credit business?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Look, I think it's a really good question. The later cycle comment I'd say is true in the U.S. But remember, we have a global business and a global team. So, as a reminder for everybody, more than half of our investment professionals at the firm are outside the United States. So, we think it's not nearly as late cycle in Europe. And then obviously, Asia is a huge opportunity for us, not only in terms of private credit where we're focused on launching a business more formally this year, but also across real estate where we see a big opportunity, infrastructure over time as well. So, I think the first answer to your question is to focus on globalizing what we're doing in credit and private credit, in particular. And we see a big opportunity to do that. And so that helps us find new opportunities for growth on a global scale. Obviously, with respect to the U.S. part of the answer, what you focus on doing is making sure you're financing businesses that perform well in a late cycle environment. And you do your underwritings presuming that you're going to be lending to a company through some kind of a pullback which, as a reminder, we think is a relatively shallow one probably starting in 2020. But we're focused on pricing transactions assuming that we're going to be entering that kind of environment. And even with that overlay, we're finding a lot to do.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much for your color and answering my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. There was an article a couple weeks ago about the latest generation funds with some of your competitors having much better or more constructive fee structures for the GP, and I'm curious if there's any reason to believe that you wouldn't have a similar experience in your next generation.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Well, I think it kind of depends, Patrick, on which strategy you're talking about. I think as an example, in our infrastructure platform, we have experienced the same phenomenon. The Infrastructure I fund had lower fee and carry than Infrastructure II and III, and so we've kind of earned the right to improve the economics for ourselves in that platform. And sometimes what we'll do when we're creating a new business is we'll go to market with something that is a bit lower fee and carry, and then earn our way into getting to a higher outcome. And that's really what happened with infrastructure. I've got no reason to believe that we don't have the opportunity to do that in other places. So, I think it is something that we'll update you from time to time. I think private equity or more established strategies, probably less likely, but some of the younger businesses, that can happen.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Gerald O'Hara of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. Just circling back on the strategic partnership initiative mentioned a moment ago, can you perhaps provide any update around how those conversations are tracking, or perhaps where you see the demand for various different products or investments, or just more broadly the opportunity set there?
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Yeah. On the strategic partnership front, several conversations ongoing. As we've talked about in the past, Gerald, it takes time to get one of these formed. So, nothing to announce today, but we'll keep you posted as conversations progress. But I would say as a general matter, we continue to make progress, talking to investors who want to do more with fewer. So, kind of broader-based multiproduct mandates is something that's become more the norm in a conversation than the exception, and that trend continues. The real question in terms of strategic partnerships of how many of those can you do large scale with recycling and multi-asset class, and that's something that we are quite focused on as a firm and actually have a team dedicated around that effort now, and that was not the case a couple years ago. So, we see there's so much opportunity, we've actually created a dedicated team to get after it. I'd say more broadly, in terms of the fund-raising environment, it continues to be quite strong. A lot of interest in what we're doing, and we have a lot of opportunities in the market today and several slated to be launched over the next 6 to 12 months.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. And then perhaps one follow-up on Marshall Wace, if we could. The firm has effectively doubled since acquisition. Can you maybe give us some sense of how the growth trajectory might evolve from this point forward? Are there additional kind of channels for distribution or perhaps even under-penetrated channels that you see opportunity in? Just kind of trying to get a sense of where that business might be headed. Thank you.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the question. Look, there is, we think, significant opportunity for continued growth. As we shared in Investor Day, we've seen a lot of growth in the last few years since we created this strategic partnership. And the fun thing about it is we think that we're just getting started. There's lots of opportunities globally with respect to new product creation and distribution channels. I was actually having a conversation this morning with our partner there about the opportunities for growth from here, and we think they're significant. And as a reminder, this obviously has been a big opportunity for us. It's helped us grow our AUM and our fee-related profits and at nearly $40 billion give or take now, we still think there's meaningful upside from here.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Larson for any closing remarks.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Valerie. Thank you, everybody, again for joining us in early July and also on this call. We look forward to giving you updates next quarter. If you have any questions, please circle up with us, of course, over the course of the day.
Scott Charles Nuttall - KKR & Co., Inc.: Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for your questions. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Amanda. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. This call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. So, please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And importantly, like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. As you've likely seen in the press release, we've announced a change in our corporate structure from a partnership to a corporation effective July 1 of this year. On the call this morning, Scott will first walk you through the rationale behind the conversion and changes being made in conjunction with the conversion. Bill is then going to go through some details related to the transaction. And then, Bill and I will review our results for the first quarter of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everybody, for being on our call today. I'm going to spend a few minutes on what we're doing and why. And because we think it is easy to overcomplicate these topics, I'm going to be brief. We like our strategy and our business model. We've been growing rapidly and we're generating attractive returns. Our stock price, however, has not performed in line with our fundamental performance. So we asked ourselves why. After a number of conversations internally and with many of you over the last couple of years, the answer became fairly simple. Our stock has been too challenging to buy and too challenging to own. So many investors go elsewhere. So we've decided to make a number of changes to address those two challenges. In short, we want to be easier to buy and easier to own. I'm on page 2 of the supplement. To become easier to buy, we're converting to a corporation. There are some technical things to do and we expect to be a C-Corp starting July 1. That means no more K-1s. It also means we'll be eligible for more ETFs and indices. We'll also be paying a dividend like any other company. Following the conversion, we expect to set the dividend at $0.50 per share per year, or about a 2.3% yield on our stock based on the current unit price. We expect to grow this dividend over time with performance and we'll revisit the level annually. We believe by being a C-Corp with a yield above the broader market, we should be easy to buy for a large percentage of the buying universe. To become easier to own, we're making three other changes. The main theme, as you will hear, is simplification. First, we're going to simplify the way we talk about ourselves and our results. Historically, in our effort to be helpful, we believe we have given out too many metrics, so many that it may have been hard to know what matters most. From our standpoint in running the business day to day, there are four metrics that really matter: AUM; management fees; total distributable earnings, which we will define as DE less equity-based compensation; and book value per share, which reflects the mark-to-market of our balance sheet and our portfolio. So, we're going to talk about those four metrics going forward. Page 3 shows what our results have looked like through that lens. This means we will not be discussing ENI going forward. ENI will show up in our book value per share, which will reflect our accrued carry and the marks on our balance sheet just as it does today, and it will be included in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs, but we will not be highlighting it on these calls. Instead, we will be focused on total distributable earnings, which is really our realized earnings. We get paid from our underlying fund investors and we pay our people when we generate cash outcomes. We do not get paid carry based on mark-to-market. We want the profit metric we discuss with you to be consistent with how we get paid by our fund investors and how we pay our people, hence, the focus on DE. We will also be discussing our AUM, our management fees, our returns in our funds, and our book value per share on a mark-to-market basis, all of which will reflect how our investments are performing and which are important drivers as you can consider the trajectory of distributable earnings. Second, we're going to give you DE detail through a quarter. We will periodically share with you what we have sold and the impact on that quarter's distributable earnings. We hope that will make DE easier to model. We know we have a lot going on and can be hard to cover. We want to do everything we can to fix that. This should result in fewer surprises and make us easier to understand. Third, we're going to simplify the way we talk about and accrue our compensation. Our approach today is complicated. We have a compensation ratio on fees, a separate compensation ratio on carry, plus stock grants and no explicit compensation attributed to balance sheet performance. So we're going to simplify compensation as well. In normal environments, we expect the compensation load in the low 40s as a percentage of total segment revenues, comprised of fees, realized carry and realized balance sheet income. This compensation ratio will include equity-based comp for our employees. Low 40s as a percentage of total segment revenues is about where we have been historically, so no overall change in compensation relative to where we have been. For example, in 2017 on this basis, we were at 42%. The new approach will be easier to model and discuss together. And over time, as we continue to scale, we expect this compensation ratio to come down. This should help you understand how to think about our compensation, which is by far our biggest expense, and we'll tie it to how we discuss and report DE. And as part of all this, we're also increasing our buyback program so that we're authorized to repurchase up to $500 million of our shares. We expect to use the buyback to help keep our share count stable and offset compensation-related equity grants. So, in summary, we're making the following changes: C-Corp conversion with a $0.50 annual dividend that we expect to grow over time; simplified reporting with a focus on AUM, management fees, total distributable earnings and book value per share; DE detail through a quarter; a simplified compensation accrual; and a larger buyback program. We have a great business culture and team. Our intention with all of the changes we're announcing today is to make us easier to understand, buy and own, so that over time our stock reflects that. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Scott. I'm going to start by walking through some of the details related to the conversion. I'm on page 4 of the supplement. As Scott mentioned, the conversion is going to become effective July 1 and is structured to be a tax-free transaction. Our last day tax as a partnership will be June 30 and K-1s will be issued for the period January 1 through June 30. There will be one final distribution of $0.17 per common unit related to the second quarter that will be paid in mid-August. Starting in the third quarter, we expect to pay dividends totaling $0.50 annually per share. And instead of a scheduled K-1, shareholders will receive a Form 1099. In terms of the financial impact of the conversion, our fee-related earnings are, for the most part, already taxed at a corporate tax rate. So the change in our structure will impact our carried interest and investment income and whether these income streams are taxed at the corporate or unitholder level. To try to help frame the numbers, we expect our effective tax rate on distributable earnings to increase over time from 7% today to approximately 22% over the next five years. These estimates are based on assumptions described on page 14 of the supplemental deck. The lower tax rate we expect for the first few years is due to conversion creating a partial step-up in our balance sheet assets and accrued carry that will be realized as those assets are sold. In addition, we expect the conversion to create some goodwill which reduces cash taxes as it is amortized over 15 years. Finally, to effect all the changes that we discussed, you are going to see a couple of other items, both related to tax planning around the conversion to a C-Corp, neither has any meaningful economic impact on our company. First, in the second quarter, we expect to realize for DE purposes approximately $650 million of losses from some legacy balance sheet investments. These are largely old credit and energy investments that have already been mark-to-market through ENI and book value per share. Our definition of DE includes all realized gains and losses, and although these investments were marked down already, the losses have not yet been realized for tax purposes. We are realizing these losses prior to the conversion. To be clear, this has zero impact on our actual cash flow, book value per share or ENI, but it will save our unitholders' cash taxes that they currently pay on flow through income as we are still a partnership for the second quarter. The second change relates to a filing that you'd see in mid-May related to some of our senior management shares in the company. As part of the conversion to C-Corp, there is an opportunity for our management team to give shares to charitable (12:45) vehicles with an advantageous tax consequence. All proceeds from the ultimate sale of these shares will go to charity over time. Approximately 20 million shares are being earmarked for donation by our executive officers. This transfer will trigger a Form 4 filing in mid-May, so we don't want you to be surprised. Essentially, our management team is planning to give $400 million worth of shares based on our current unit price to charity over time. This transfer will happen prior to the conversion and we will have to make an SEC filing to report it, but none of these shares will be sold into the market in the near term. And to be clear, we have no near-term plans for the company to offer any primary shares. So let me repeat this, in mid-May, you will see a Form 4 filing for 20 million shares that will be donated to charity over time. None of these shares are being sold. None of the executive officers are selling shares anytime soon, and the company is not planning to offer any primary shares. Page 5 summarizes the key takeaways from changes we've announced today. We believe that these changes will make us easier to understand, buy and own. And one other announcement before I discuss first quarter results, we are going to be hosting an Investor Day on July 9 in New York. So, we will get back to you soon with details. Shifting gears, let's turn to page 7 of the supplement and review this quarter's results. We reported after-tax distributable earnings of $304 million for the quarter, or $0.37 on a per adjusted unit basis. And over the trailing 12 months, after-tax DE came in at $1.5 billion or $1.85 per adjusted unit. First quarter and trailing 12-month after-tax economic net income was $365 million and $1.8 billion, which translates into $0.42 and $2.15 of after-tax ENI per unit, respectively. Management fees for the quarter were up 21% on a year-over-year basis, contributing to another strong fee-related earnings quarter with $223 million of fee-related earnings. That brings LTM fee-related earnings to $868 million, up over 40% from the comparable prior period. Continued strong performance within capital markets was a key driver. In terms of other metrics we track closely, we experienced growth in both AUM and fee-paying AUM, as well as book value per unit, all of which were up nicely on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. We continue to believe that our overall performance is ultimately driven by the five things that we need to do well: generate investment performance, raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments, and use our model to capture more economics from everything that we do. Craig will now touch on all five of these drivers. Craig?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill. In terms of investment performance, let's start there. Please take a look at page 8 of the supplement that profiles our performance on an LTM basis across our flagship funds. In private equity, our three flagship funds appreciated 24% on a blended basis, that's approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of the S&P 500 and the MSCI World Indices over this timeframe. Our real asset strategies are performing as well, with our more mature Real Estate, Infrastructure, and Energy flagship funds up 10%, 20% and 13%, respectively. And in credit, we saw strong performance in our Mezzanine and Special Sits II funds in particular. The HFRX Special Sits Index has declined over the last 12 months compared to the plus 9% figure for Special Sits II you see on page 8, and our Mezz fund has appreciated 30% over the trailing 12 months. And in terms of our balance sheet, the investment portfolio was up 3% in the quarter, and it's up 10% on an LTM basis. Turning to fundraising, in the first quarter, we raised $11 billion of new capital and over the trailing 12 months have raised over $40 billion of new capital. The largest contributor this quarter was our infrastructure strategy where we raised an initial $6 billion in connection with our next flagship infrastructure fund. This is a great example of a platform that's continued to scale. The $6 billion we've raised is already two times the size of our most recent infra fund in a strategy where we see continued long-term secular growth opportunities. In public markets, inflows from our strategic partnerships as well as a number of leverage credit SMAs were the key contributors. This quarter's figures do not reflect the impact of the FS transaction which closed on April 9, and that's going to result in over $13 billion of additional fee-paying AUM in next quarter's results. Also, capital inflows in the quarter contributed to $59 billion of dry powder at quarter end, which is up from Q4 despite a healthy level of deployment of activity. And we have $25 billion of capital commitments that become fee-paying on an as-invested basis at a weighted average rate of approximately 100 basis points. Shifting to new investments, we invested $3.7 billion across businesses and geographies in the first quarter. Private markets deployment was $2.4 billion, anchored by a sizable investment out of our core strategy. And we're also active in Asia private equity with approximately $900 million invested across a number of opportunities. In public markets, we invested $1.4 billion, coming primarily from investments made both in direct lending as well as in special sits. Moving to monetizations, we've continued to see a healthy level of exit activity across our private equity business. For the quarter, we completed a number of secondaries which coupled with several strategic sales resulted in over $200 million in cash carry in Q1. On a blended basis, the PE exits were done at approximately two times our cost. As Scott mentioned, we will give additional DE detail through the quarter. As we stand here today, the after-tax DE impact of monetizations that are closed or that we expect to close in the second quarter is approximately $250 million or $0.30 per distributable unit. And finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. Our capital markets business has continued to remain active to start the year. In Q1, the team executed approximately 50 transactions, and activity was broad-based. Approximately 80% of activity was debt-related with the largest revenue components coming from financings related to our investments in Air Medical as well as PetVet. Page 9 of the supplement summarizes our core fundamentals across the five categories that Bill mentioned earlier. The power of our model is again evident in our results, and we're pleased with the progress and the momentum we're seeing across the firm. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Since the number of people in the queue is actually pretty sizable, we'd ask that you limit yourself to one question as well as a follow-up, if necessary, and then return to the queue if there are any other items that would be helpful for us to address. And with that, Amanda, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. It's actually Craig Siegenthaler, Credit Suisse here.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Craig.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning, Craig.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, I just wanted to follow-up on the index adds and corporate governance. I believe there are no changes to corporate governance or voting rights. So I was just wondering what are your plans or objectives for index additions and could you allocate some voting rights into the float to qualify for the Russell 1000?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hi, Craig. Let me – it's Craig. Let me begin. First, just to be clear, we are not checking the box, if you will, from a taxation standpoint. So what we're doing is a natural conversion of the partnership into a corporation and I think this actually will be helpful to us from an index standpoint. To answer your question, we think the indices that we'll be eligible for fall into two broad categories and should result in at least 20 million shares of demand in our stock. The first of those are the total market indices. So there are index providers, S&P would be an example, that have changed their guidelines over the past year and won't currently consider companies that have more than one share class for inclusion in some of their indices. But in their total market indices, companies like ours, with more than a single share class, are eligible for inclusion. So that's the first category. And the second are those that are benchmarked off of CRSP data. So CRSP stands for The Center for Research in Security Prices, so Vanguard most specifically has a number of indices that are benchmarked off of CRSP data. And incremental to all of that are areas like smart beta, so smart beta at the year-end, at the end of 2017 exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, U.S. equities being the largest piece of this asset pool. And again, as a publicly-traded partnership, I don't think we've been relevant to those strategies. And from a voting rights standpoint, it's actually interesting when you think of us versus most of the equities, there's actually a really clear alignment. Employees own 40% of the company. And when I think of all the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders since we announced last quarter that we are considering a conversion, I think we've proven that we engage and listen to our shareholders and value their thoughts and perspectives. So, for us, the structure and the framework works and certainly, we'll have the ability to change this in the future if we think that's what makes sense.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great color, Craig. And just one quick follow-up. It was nice to see that you're moving away from ENI. But just to be clear, going forward, the sell-side should now send total distributable EPS to First Call (00:24:23) going forward, right?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Craig, that's correct. We're not going to report ENI or after-tax ENI in our press release. So, when I think of the first notes that I know you want to publish when a press release comes out that earnings metric would need to be that distributable earnings figure less equity-based comp because the ENI figure is not going to be in the press release.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey. Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit more about the decision not to break out the earnings anymore, which it looks like you're doing, given it was my concern that this could mask the higher value of that stream and cause investors just to kind of default to a price-to-book framework for your stock without kind of giving an extra value for that stream?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Patrick. This is Bill. We're not contemplating changing the reporting of the income stream. So, we will still be reporting fee income. We will still be reporting transaction fees, monitoring fees, performance income and balance sheet earnings. But all of that on a TDE basis as opposed to an ENI basis. The one thing that we will be doing, and Scott referenced this earlier, is from a compensation point of view where we're going to be talking about one compensation ratio as opposed to having it in three places.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: So there – but there won't be a separate expense is, I guess, what I'm going to?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: There'll be revenue... (00:26:05)
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: ...up on top.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And there is going to be expenses down below. No difference than how we report it right now.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I mean, said another way, Patrick, I think – because you'll still be able to calculate a fee-related earnings number...
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: ...off what we're going to report going forward.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Right, I think it makes sense (00:26:21).
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: So, Patrick, to belabor the point, if you go to page 7, and this is just ENI or page 8 which is TDE, when we give out compensation, compensation will be one number which will include stock-based comp. We'll report occupancy and we'll report other operating expenses.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: All right. Thanks.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations on pulling the trigger.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I guess two questions. First one is maybe talking a little bit about the capital return policy and maybe specifically the dividend. I understand starting at $0.50 but – and the change to DE construct which I think is good. But as you think about growth over time, is that going to be – should we think that's going to be linked to more closely to say growth in the management fee component of it, or is it not going to be that hard and fast? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think of – or how you're thinking of that over time.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Rob, this is Bill. It will not be maniacally focused on fee growth as we think about our future dividend. And the way we think about it today and the way we've thought about it historically is that, from a capital management point of view, we want to pay out a reasonable distribution old way, dividend new way, to our unitholders, but we want to take that excess and continue to put the excess earnings onto the balance sheet and continue to compound and grow book value.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Just maybe as a follow-up, just maybe really more a point of curiosity as much as anything, but how much or how big an influence was the fact that you had this, let's call it, a balance sheet strategy and because you're able to – not that it's a good thing to have losses, but because you're able to recognize some losses and get the step-up in basis that that creates some tax benefits that allow you to kind of ease the transition to a higher tax rate? I mean, to what degree did that kind of really play a larger role in your conversion decision?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Zero. Hey, Rob, it's Scott. Let me just give you the – maybe a little bit more background. So, zero to do with tax planning or anything about recognizing losses for the balance sheet had no impact on the thought process. It just made sense to do that once we decided to convert. But the broader background maybe to share just to give you all little bit of color is we've been a publicly traded partnership for nearly eight years on the New York Stock Exchange. When we listed, we had $55 billion of AUM. We now have almost $200 million. Our book value per share was about $6. It's now $14.50. So, this is a much bigger discussion. Our stock price has really just not grown at the same pace as our company. So, we've really spent the last eight years working to sort out why. And if you think back, we've worked on articulating our story and we thought about reporting changes. We went out and tried to find new investors with many of you. We worked with back offices of mutual funds to help them operationalize K-1s. But honestly, after eight years of effort, it's not clear we've made a lot of lasting progress. So, where this is really coming from is we're stepping back and simplifying our thought process about what's been going on. So, the high level is as best we can sort out, over 60% of the capital investing in the U.S. equity markets cannot or will not buy PTPs. And if you think about where flows have been going, it's been going to passive smart beta indices, none of which invest in PTPs. So, in other words, virtually 100% of net flows could not or would not buy us and 60% of existing capital can't buy us. So, we kind of stepped way back and it's no wonder it's been hard. So, it kind of became clear to us that we've been fishing in a small pond with a slow leak and wondering why we weren't catching anything. So then, it was pretty clear there's a big ocean nearby, we had a lot of fish that might like our bait, so we started thinking about moving over to the ocean. And then, we asked our largest shareholders, what do they think, what's their advice. And that was virtually all consistent that moving to the ocean was a good idea. And so, that's really the background. It's got nothing to do with tax planning or anything else. It's really coming from a place of what I said before that we really like what we've built and we want to keep building for the very long term. And we're moving. And like any move, there's cost, there's risk associated with it. But we're confident that it's the right thing for the long term to be easier to own. And so we're now going to go out and try to find partners and shareholders who believe in us and what we're building. And so just always remember we own 40% of the company. We're not running the place for annual cash flow to the people in the firm. We're focused on long-term equity value creation. And so we think this change is in service of that equity value creation and creating long-term value, which is where our focus is. So no is the short answer to your question and that's a longer answer.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. Just maybe – first question just on the fundraising, not only this quarter, but the last couple of quarters, you guys have been coming in very strong. And it's not -you don't have your U.S. flagship fund in the market. Just wanted to get a better sense on what's driving it and then even the outlook. We know there is lot of positive trends for alternatives, but even relative to the peers, it seems like some of these – your newer buckets, newer strategies are just garnering a lot more than maybe we would have expected.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hi, Mike. It's Craig. Thanks for the compliment. And you're right; it has been a very busy 12 months for us. As I said, that new capital raise figure is over $40 billion. Just to give you a little bit of color on that, $25 billion of that has come from private markets. And of that, 70% has come from core infrastructure and our private equity strategies. So I think when we think of those, you're right, two of those three are ones that probably or may not have been front of mind for people even a couple of years ago. The other $15 billion is within public markets and that $15 billion is actually really diversified. It's fundraising across a number of strategies, credit opportunities, lending partner strategies, SMAs, as well as the strategic partnerships. In terms of where we're active currently from an episodic standpoint, it includes infrastructure, European private equity, energy income and growth, and direct lending both in the U.S. and Europe, and this is in addition to areas where we look to raise capital on a more continuous basis, includes the CLO business, the leverage credit platforms in the U.S. and Europe as well as the BDCs and hedge fund partnerships. And then finally, just from a fee-paying AUM standpoint and a management fee standpoint as you think about our model, it's worth remembering that we have $25 billion of capital that will become fee-paying on an as-invested basis at a weighted average rate of 100 basis points. So, all of that is the granularity. I think the other slide that I guess I'd point you to is slide 15 that's in the presentation. And if you take a step back from all of that granularity over the – what we've done in the last 12 months and where we're fundraising, I think your point is very well taken. When you look at the alternatives as a whole, we are fortunate to be in an industry that we think there are secular trends and we think those secular trends are going to continue. So, you've seen as an industry double-digit rate with continued expectations for the industry as a whole to continue to grow and continue to grow very nicely. And when you think of where we are in that framework, we've continued to gain share. And I think when we look at the various areas that we have and the continued scaling opportunities for us, it does continue to keep us excited about what this could mean for us over the long term.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Michael. It's Scott. The only thing I'd add is if you look at last four years, we raised over $100 billion. But I think what's particularly exciting is if you think about where we've been, there's been a lot of Fund I, Fund II dynamic the last several years. And so, we've been able to do that while going through that early startup phase for a number of different businesses and while also growing our investor base. We don't talk about it enough, but we've really expanded our investor base materially. It's up 3x over the course of the last eight years. And we think we can grow it materially from here. So, I think it's a combination of several things. But we feel optimistic especially now we've scaled a number of these businesses and we continue to grow the investors, there's more to come. But slide 15 tells the story pretty well.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. This is Kaimon Chung for Glenn Schorr. Just want to get a better sense of what drove the performance (00:36:14) this quarter, it came in stronger than what I would have expected given your holdings, and maybe just some color on the underlying company portfolio trends like revenue and EBITDA growth?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Go ahead, Craig. Why don't you take that?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. So, Kai, when you look at the performance of our publics in the private equity portfolio, they were down 6.5% in the quarter. So, you're right. The overall portfolio as a whole was positive. That's in a quarter where both the MSCI and the S&P 500 were both down. So, that strength in the overall portfolio did come from the private portion from a market standpoint. In terms of the second part of your question on revenue and EBITDA, every quarter we go through the global private equity portfolio and look as best as we can on an apples-to-apples basis the revenue and EBITDA growth across the portfolio and we weight those statistics on the remaining fair value. And the broad trends across the portfolio have remained consistent. On a percentage basis, we're continuing to see low-double-digit revenue growth and EBITDA growth across the portfolio. So, it's nice to see these continued trends on a global basis.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Basically, the operational performance offset some multiple contraction when you look at it on the whole, but it's a strong operational performance quarter.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. If I could do a follow-up, so your ROE was 14% last 12 months, and if I recall correctly, it's been about 15% over the last three years. Why wouldn't that be high for asset manager like you – even with your balance sheet model and what your expectation is over the next cycle?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Could you ask the first part of your question again?
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Just your ROE has been about 14%, maybe 15% over the last three years. Why wouldn't that be higher, and just where do you expect that to go?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Are you talking return on equity?
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Yes.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Okay. I'd say, over time, we'd expect that to continue to be strong and potentially go up. I mean, what we're focused on is the fact that we do – what we do have over half of our capital now is in non-private equity. A lot of those businesses are not yet generating significant carried interest. As they mature, we expect that will change, which will continue to drive the return on equity for the overall enterprise up, all else equal. So, we'll talk about this more when we're all together in July at the Investor Day. But we've got reason to be optimistic that the return on equity will continue to be attractive and, with performance, grow.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And I think, Kai, if you look at page 3 for a second, you see some of what you're talking about. Like, when I think of the earnings power of the firm, I think the two most important statistics for us are in the top left-hand part of page 3 in the AUM and the bottom left-hand part our book value per unit. And so, I think when you look at our AUM and the success that we've had fundraising, the earnings power of the firm in my mind has increased unquestionably over the last couple of years, but we're still deploying a lot of that capital. So, if we're successful from a performance standpoint, you should see that bottom-right hand part follow suit (00:39:25).
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: All right. And when you look at just in this particular quarter, not to pile on, but when you look at the way the book value is growing, it's actually up 3% in the quarter. Now, we focus more longer term. But just, again, on the quarter, it was up 3% in a very challenging market. So, when you look at the ROE from a TDE point of view and an ROE from an ENI point of view, I think the results as of December 31 on an LTM basis and as of March 31, they're still pretty attractive.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey. Great. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hi, Devin.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: I guess first question here, it sounds like one of the maybe secondary drivers behind the conversion decision is a more attractive M&A currency. And I'm curious if that's something you've actually heard in the past from potential targets. And then whether you can expand a little bit on the comment and whether there is any implication or maybe read-through we should kind of be making around appetite for M&A post conversion?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Devin. It's Scott. I'd say the short answer is we have heard in the past that PTP units are not an attractive M&A currency. So, it has been something that we have been told in the past. And I'd say it's broader than just M&A currency. I think there's other types of more flexible financing that we could now do as a C-Corp that's very difficult to do as a PTP. So, there's nothing that we would point you to as imminent, but more flexibility to continue to scale our efforts globally is a good thing. And some of the conversations we've had where those – where that came up as a roadblock will no longer be the case. So, we'll – the focus is primarily organic growth still, but we have looked from time to time at larger opportunities where having a real M&A currency would be valuable and we now have the ability to pursue those more aggressively.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Terrific. Great color there. And then just a follow-up, but this may be difficult. But it's just another great quarter for capital markets. It sounds like the outlook there is still positive. And I know last year was a really high bar and a great year. But last quarter, I think we spoke about the potential being something still quite a bit higher than 2016. So, just trying to think about for our model and what that business looks like right now. Should we be thinking about something still kind of between 2016 and 2017 or is maybe the backdrop as good as it was last year or even better for some reason?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Devin. This is Bill. We really don't want to give guidance on capital markets per se because when you think about it, every single quarter we're starting from ground zero. But when you think about where we've gone in capital markets from particularly focused in the U.S. to now in Europe, and now in Asia and growing our third-party business, I don't want to say that this is the new new, your reference to 2016 and 2017 being so much different, but we have a lot more irons in the fire and so we are able to transact in a much bigger way today than we did in 2016 and 2015. So, I'm cautiously optimistic on the progress of our capital markets business prospectively. For example, when you talk about this quarter's number which is in excess of another $100 million this quarter and when you look at the page on – if you look at page 10 in the press release, we're reflecting three solid quarters with an excess of $100 million. In this quarter, 35% actually came from a third-party business. And so, we're getting a lot of traction in an area that was in its infancy stages only a couple of years ago. So a long-winded way of me saying that we're not going to give you guidance as to how to model this, but we're very optimistic around our capital markets business.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah. Appreciate it, figured I'd try. Thanks, Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Nice try.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. Bill, just maybe one for you perhaps. As you think about the sort of – I'll call it the amortization schedule or the normalization of your tax rate as a C-Corp, is there any way to sort of sense how we should think about that tax rate over the next couple of years and is it so the exit tax rate would be 20-some-odd-percent, or are there other type of planning things that you can do as you look out over the next few years that could sort of (00:44:08) the dilution, if you will?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Bill, that's a very good question. And to be honest with you, I could give you high-level color now, but that will change over time because what will not be known is how that step-up is being allocated either to assets or to carry or to amortization until the transaction closes. So, even though it's a tax-free transaction for our unitholders, we do get this step-up which will reduce taxes certainly in the near term. The way I think about it very simply is that, right now, on average, our TDE tax rate has been about 7%. Over time, it will grow to 22%. And so, over the next few quarters, once we go C-Corp, and as we're selling those assets, it could really be that from a TDE perspective, there isn't going to be a lot of tax to pay in the first few years. Once we ramp up and then we start investing in assets after we go C-Corp, those assets once sold or that carry once crystallized would be at 22%. So, the way to think about it, and what we'll suggest and we'll keep you updated along the way is think about we're at 7% now and over five years, we're going to be at 22%. So, every year, we would assume that our effective tax rate is going to go up by 300 basis points. Again, it's not linear. We can't tell you what that number is until July. And even then, it's going to be incredibly hard to predict. But back of the envelope and for modeling purposes, I'd recommend that's what you use, Bill.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one quick follow-up, just technical. You mentioned you're going to keep everyone abreast of sort of your pace of DE as you go through the quarter, is that going to be on a standard release date or is that going to be more of idiosyncratic as things occur?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Probably more idiosyncratic as exits occur. And to be clear, what we're talking about providing through the quarter, Bill, is some sense of what's been happening quarter-to-date and incremental update to get to that point for realized gains and realized carry. So that's the stuff that we'll be sharing with you through the quarter. Much like we do on these calls, we'll just keep you updated over the course of a quarter as opposed to just doing it on the call.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Right. And, Bill, remember we're in this together. So this is going to be how we're going to report prospectively. And so, we'll try this out for a couple of quarters. We'd love to take any sort of input or advice from everyone that covers us to try to get the information as crisp as possible certainly around quarter-end.
William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning, guys.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Quite another sort of technical question first. So I guess as we think about the $500 million authorization, maybe taking a step back how are you guys planning to use that, I know in the past it was largely to offset share count dilution, but in times of equity market volatility, could we guys see you be more aggressive on that? So, that's part one. And, I guess, part two, just as I think about the share count for kind of the DE calculation starting you guys going fully C-Corp, sort of what's the right number to jump off of?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Okay. I'll cover the first one first, and the second one second. As it relates to the buyback, right now, we have roughly about $290 million authorized. We're increasing that to $500 million. What we said historically and what we're going to say today is that we are going to use that buyback to actually focus on shares that are granted to our employees to make sure that we're not diluting in public. We're also increasing the size just so we have availability that in market dislocation, we have the ability to react to any sort of market disruption. But again, there's nothing new as it relates to this buyback as opposed to the buyback we already had in place.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I would say, Alex, we have the ability to be aggressive when the opportunity is there. So, we bought $500 million or $600 million back over time, including retirements for tax cancellation. And if you look at the average price at which that was done, it was somewhere between $14 and $15. So, we've tended to lean in when the market opportunity is there and I think you should expect that to continue.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And then as it relates to what share count to use as far as TDE is concerned, if you look at page 24 of the press release, we give you information where we lay out what the adjusted unit eligible for distribution is. And so, the way to think about that, that should be steady state for the quarters where shares aren't being vested. When shares are vested, you'll see a modest increase in those shares and that occurs in April and October. But – that's why you don't see much as way of movement in our total share count from December 31 to March 31.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. And I guess the second question just more, I guess, strategic away from the conversion. As I look at the FS Investment (sic) [FS Investments] that closed I guess earlier, can you guys remind us what sort of contribution you expect to get from both the management fee perspective and FRE perspective? And I guess more importantly, synergistically, with the rest of the business, would you mind spending a minute on kind of how that can help the business grow as a whole as being part of now KKR and I guess particularly as it is related to the capital market activity one might see out of it?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Alex. This is Bill. I'll take the first and I'll let Scott handle the second. When we announced the transaction of FS, we put out a press release and said that on a full run rate basis, the income pickup from additional capital that we'll now be managing with FS would be approximately $120 million. And that to be clear includes not only management fees, but incentive fees. We didn't give out any details on that and don't expect to give it right now, but we'll be more than happy to report next quarter and the quarter after that more or less the progress of that new JV we've got with Franklin Square. But we're really excited to be partnering with them.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: So I'd say in terms of the second question, look, the partnership provides us with a number of strategic benefits, I'd say the biggest of which is just scale. Where we're seeing the best risk reward in private credit is at the larger end of the market. So there's been more competition that's come into the small end, but when you're talking about transactions $300 million to $1 billion, there's just not a lot of players that can compete in that space. So now with the combined BDC platform, which is roughly $18 billion plus the other pools that we have, we're amongst the largest in that space. And so what we're able to do is have our private credit investment teams, including our FS partners, partner with our capital markets team to be aggressively pursuing large-scale transactions. And what that means is more origination for private credit and more syndication and underwriting opportunity for capital markets. And at a high level, that's what we're pursuing. And we've already seen thus far a meaningful tick up in terms of private credit origination as a result of the partnership even though we just closed.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking all the questions, guys.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just a couple more on C-Corp conversion. Again, congrats on that, I think totally makes sense, of course. I think, Bill, you're talking about on the last earnings call, sort of, the hurdle rates where you thought this would be, sort of, a breakeven move to do this, and I think you recited two multiple turns. Just want to go back. I think the stock was around $24 around that time. Were you thinking of the multiple on consensus ENI and that would – if that were the case, that would imply something in the high-20s of where you would think your stock ought to be to sort of view this as successful. I just want to see if that's about right. And overall, kind of, what timeframe would you be expecting that.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: I mean, nothing really has changed this quarter compared to the last quarter when we gave you a little color. I mean, a way to think about it is if you want to focus on ENI and because prospectively we're not going to be from a dilution point of view, our effective tax rate from an ENI perspective is similarly about 6% or 7%. And so, from an ENI perspective, that number will go up to 22%. So, the dilution from an ENI perspective you're going to see about 15%. So you could do the math on what our stock price is to figure out what that multiple difference is. From a TDE point of view, it's a little better only for the fact that when you think about the cash taxes that we're going to have to pay because they are going to ramp up over time, actually the dilution is going to be a lot better. And you should see the dilution going from – right now if we're at 7%, we go to 10%, dilution is only going to be about 3%. But again, that will ramp up over time.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: But to be clear, Brian, what we're talking about is what you'd need to believe from a multiple expansion standpoint for the stock to stay where it is as opposed to have an increase in the stock. That's what we were saying on the last call. I think given our focus is TDE, we're expecting low-single-digit dilution to after-tax TDE per share in the near term based on page 13. And I do think even though it shows up on page 13, it's worth articulating again. Our fee-related earnings are already taxed as a C-Corp. And historically, we haven't had conversations about our balance sheet trading as a multiple of earnings. So, really, you're kind of down to this question of what happens on the tax rate on carry and balance sheet gains. So – but the bottom line for us is we believe the near-term is interesting, but this is much more about the long-term opportunity we have to build our firm and find more like-minded partners and shareholders.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, got it. All right. And then maybe just to follow on on that, I think obviously your strategy is not changing, but just wanted to sort of be clear as to whether the conversion changes anything you do. Clearly, in M&A, it may because it may lead you to do more acquisitions if you have a better currency and more attractive currency. Does it change the way you think about compensation across the firm or any other operational characteristics?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: No. I think the only thing we're trying to do is simplify as we discussed, and that's where this low-40s percentage of total segment revenues on a realized basis comes from. So, we're just packaging what we've been doing more simply as opposed to making a change.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, that's great. Great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question this morning. I suppose one more on the topic of conversion, should the tax structure change at some point in the future? And I guess in adverse fashion, would you still have the ability to switch back to a partnership structure, or should we really think about this consistent with your recent comments (55:57) in more of a effectively permanent decision as you are thinking about the long term?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Gerry. This is Bill. We'll be really brief on this. We converted to a C-Corp, and we plan to be a C-Corp, but very specifically, to answer your question, technically, there is an ability to unconvert, but if we were to do that, we would actually have to get shareholder approval.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then switching gears a little bit back to the fundraising, kind of touching on that first close for the follow-on infrastructure fund, I believe you noted $6 billion in size. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the demand for that fund, new versus existing LPs and perhaps elaborate on the opportunity set looks like? Is it focused strictly on U.S. or potentially global in breadth? That'd be helpful. Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Gerry. It's Craig. Just from a fundraising standpoint, we can't give a whole lot of – a lot of details as we're in the midst of that fundraising. To answer some of the questions, and as we think about the platform as a whole, I think there are three things to remember. One, we've been delivering attractive results for a decade. Two is, as we think about our definition of infrastructure, it's very disciplined, it's risk-based. We're looking for critical infrastructure globally with a focus on downside protection. And I think the third piece is that we've proven we can navigate complexities, whether that's establishing creative (57:29) partnership situations where we have unique operational capabilities or sector specialization. I think we, in a number of cases, have found situations with complexity and we can turn it into something simple. So, I think those are, to-date, things that that LPs have recognized and they've been helpful for us in raising the capital that we have that we've raised to-date.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. I'd say that the strategy for the firm is global and maybe the way to answer your question is if you look at our recent funds more broadly, we've seen a quarter to a half of the investors in these funds to be new to the strategy or new to the firm. So, we continue, as I said before, to expand the investor base.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. So, if DE is the new primary metric we should be focusing on and I appreciate that that metric can still bump around quite a lot from year-to-year, but if we look at your information here on slide 3, it's sort of implying a 3% annual growth rate. So, just wondering, do you guys think you can drive a more consistent higher growth rate than that because it seems like you might need to, to get kind of the valuation that you want here as a C-Corp?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: You're talking about the DE bottom right on slide 3?
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Correct.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. So, I think you got to – you'd have to kind of parse through what's going on there, Chris. So really there was a period of time, especially, kind of, in the early years, 2013 through 2016, because you remember how we came public, we reverse merged basically the private KKR into the public KPE vehicle. And so, there's a period of time in there, 2013 through 2016 in particular, where we were monetizing balance sheet gains coming out of the crisis from investments that were in private equity that we just happened to kind of merge into at an attractive price. So, if you disaggregate what's going on in that chart, what you'd see is the management fee and transaction fee component, upper right, going up, you'd see carry going up, and then you'd see more of a lumpy kind of an elevated balance sheet gain period. And most of those outsized gains have now been harvested. So, if you kind of normalize for that, you'd see a much faster growth rate in the bottom right. And so, the way we look at it is we're going to be continuing to grow our management fees. We think we can continue to grow our carry. And as I said before, there is a lot of latent carry opportunity in our non-private equity businesses, in particular. A lot of dollars in the ground that aren't yet generating cash carry and are just starting to now. And then, we believe the balance sheet now is in more of a steady run rate as opposed to that outsized period of gains. So, what we're going to be talking to you about going forward is really the three forms of cash revenue, fee, carry, balance sheet. And we think we're at a point now where you're going to see a much faster trajectory going forward all else equal. But, July, we'll walk through all of that in a great amount of detail with you.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Disdier of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: All right. Morning or afternoon, everyone. So I understand you're focused on the long term, and Scott, I'm not sure if you just alluded to it or not, but it seems like you can still be tactical in nature over – until July. So as I think about the commentary around the tax step-up tied to realizations of balance sheet assets and accrued carry thinking kind of First Data and I think they're off of lock-up too? And then two, the dynamic of taking DE losses on legacy assets thereby saving unitholders cash taxes, I mean, does that imply that we could see a step-up in realizations in the shorter timeframe that you may or may not have been holstering, thereby lowering tax leakage and then growing book value at a kind of more advantageous rate or at least is the incentive there?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Andrew; this is Bill. Tax planning is important, but it isn't the only driver of what we're doing. Once we've decided to make this conversion, we're optimizing certain things that we can do. But to your point about First Data, we hold that investment, we like that investment, we wouldn't try to force anything unnaturally just to save some taxes. So the business model comes first and around that business model, to the extent that we can be proactive and plan accordingly around saving taxes for our unitholders in the company, that's what we'll be doing in between now and June 30 for sure.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Everything is normal course. The only thing that we're telling you today is what we expect to be other than normal course between now and July 1. So no other changes to our approach.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. And then, one quick follow up, on the $0.30 or $250 million of, I think DE, is that post-tax or pre-tax?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: For this quarter...
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Yes.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: It is pre-tax and post-tax because there is really no tax per se that's paid on carry or balance sheet earnings.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just sticking with the C-Corp conversion topic, it sounds like you're converting the entire structure. Just wanted to confirm that I heard you right there that you're changing the entire legal entity structure there as opposed to just filing as a C-Corp which we saw elsewhere. So, just curious if you could help us understand what that entails? What sort of changes do you need to make to effect that sort of change? What actions are you taking to make that happen?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Mike. It's Craig. So, the actual conversion itself is to converge – the public company is converting from a partnership to a corporation. So, what we're not doing is we're not checking the box and we're not electing to be taxed as a corporation, but keeping the public entity as a partnership. So, the public entity itself, again, is converting from a partnership to a corporation. And alongside with that, we will file a Certificate of Conversion in Delaware to effect that change.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a follow-up on, in the context of this conversion, just curious how and to what extent it impacts your thinking about your balance sheet strategy and the types of investments that you'd be able to make or maybe would be more attractive or less attractive to make off the balance sheet. In the past, you would compound the balance sheet pre-tax and now, you would be compounding it post-tax. How does that impact the overall thinking and strategy there?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: No changing in overall thinking. We're going to be running the business on July 1 no different than how we were running it on June 25.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Lee Cooperman of Omega Advisors. Your line is open.
Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.: Thank you very much. I was getting the impression you didn't want to talk to anybody that spends money on the buy side. I'd like to make a suggestion which is consistent with the changes you announced this morning. And to be clear, I speak both as an owner of KKR and an even larger owner of First Data. You basically made a comment, Scott, that the stock price is not performing in line with fundamental performance and you wanted to move from a leaky pond to an ocean. My suggestion is that there's no reason for First Data to have dual-class voting shares, and the elimination of that will take you from a leaky pond to an ocean because S&P has said they will not include in the index basically dual voting shares any more. So, I'd like you to take on an advisement (01:05:46) interested, is why not eliminate dual-voting shares and move from a leaky pond to an ocean, because Frank Bisignano has done an excellent job in First Data, it's a major investment for you guys and for us, and I think it would be very salutary in its impact. Thank you for listening.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: No, thank you, Lee. And I appreciate your partnership on both KKR and First Data. I think we have a completely shared and aligned view on the wonderful job Frank and the team have done at First Data. Happy to chat with you about any and all topics, including that one, but it's certainly something we're looking at, love to chat with you about it and we'll continue to look at. But thank you for your partnership and your comments.
Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. My question is on the differential and mark on the balance sheet versus the PE portfolio. I understand there's a different ownership of First Data, but just curious if there's anything you'd point to that drove such a big gap between the two marks because it was a lot better than I was expecting on the balance sheet?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Which investment in particular, Patrick?
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: No. The balance sheet, broadly. It seemed to be a lot better than I was expecting.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: The performance of the balance sheet?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: So, when you look at the performance...
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah. Yeah.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: ...we have mentioned earlier that the performance was up about 3%. We talked about the PE fund being up about 0.4%. But when you take a look at a couple of the investments that we show on page 12 of the press release, you can see that it was a nice increase with USI, it was a nice increase with WMIH. And so, we had some significant large size positions on the balance sheet this quarter that actually, again, on a mark-to-market basis did relatively well. But more importantly, when you take a look at all of the investments on the balance sheet, when I look across all of the platforms, and I'm looking at the top left from private equity all the way down to credit, all performed at or better than benchmark this quarter.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. We had a good quarter in real assets, in credit, in growth equity, a lot of the PE investments. It was just a good quarter all around, Patrick.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: And USI is a private position, right?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: It is. Yes.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah. Was there something that changed that allowed that to step up so much?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, we've held it for the better part of nine months and we don't really comment specifically on portfolio company details when we go through our valuation process. But suffice it to say, something good must be happening if we wrote it off.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: If (01:08:36) USI made a couple of acquisitions, Patrick.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Craig Larson.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Amanda, thank you. And thank you, everybody, for joining our phone call. Please, obviously, follow-up with us directly if you have any additional questions. And we hope to see everybody July 9 at our Investor Day. Thanks, again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will open for questions. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Glenda. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I am joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we have posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning, we reported our Q4 and full year 2017 results. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a strong year for us. Let's begin by turning to page 2 of the supplement. We reported after-tax distributable earnings of $427 million for the quarter, or $0.52 on a per adjusted unit basis, and for the full year after-tax DE came in at $1.6 billion, or $1.91 per adjusted unit. Fourth quarter and full year after-tax economic net income came in at $415 million and $2 billion, which translates into $0.48 and $2.38 of after-tax ENI per unit, respectively. We had a record fee-related earnings quarter with $238 million of FRE, bringing full year FRE to $867 million, which was up over 60% compared to 2016. This was driven both by the growth in management fees as well as continued strong performance within Capital Markets, as you'll hear more about in a few minutes. And in terms of other metrics that we track closely, we experienced significant growth in 2017 in our AUM, up 30%, and our book value per unit, up 17%. These statistics are particularly important as they ultimately are going to drive the earnings power of the firm looking forward. Now, as we evaluate our performance overall, there are five things that we need to do well. We need to generate investment performance, raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments and use our model to capture more economics from everything that we do. I'm going to update you on our progress on the first two and Bill is going to cover the remaining three. In terms of our investment performance, please take a look at page 3 of the deck that shows 2017 performance across our flagship funds. We had strong performance across our asset classes in 2017. In Private Equity, our three flagship funds appreciated 34% on a blended basis. Our real assets strategies are performing as well, with our more mature Real Estate, Infrastructure and Energy flagship funds up 12%, 15% and 9%, respectively. And in credit, we saw strong performance in our Special Situations II and Mezzanine funds in particular. And finally, in terms of the balance sheet, our investment portfolio was flat for the quarter, but for the year appreciated 12%. Turning to fundraising in the fourth quarter, we raised $16 billion of new capital. This includes commitments to our core investment strategy, which I'll touch on in a moment, the final close of our second Real Estate and Opportunistic Private Credit (sic) [Private Credit Opportunities] funds, and inflows into CLOs as well as alternative credit SMAs. Looking at the full-year, you can see our progress on page four of the supplement. We've had a strong, organically-driven fundraising momentum with AUM and fee paying AUM up 30% and 16%, respectively, for the year. These capital inflows contributed to $57 billion of dry powder at year-end, which is up nearly 20% from Q3. And as we note on page 4, we have approximately $20 billion of capital commitments that becomes fee paying on an as-invested basis at a weighted average rate of approximately 100 basis points, providing direct line of sight towards future management fee growth. In terms of the drivers of AUM growth in 2017, there were really three main factors. The first is benchmark Private Equity fundraising activity. The strong performance we saw at NAXI and Asia II helped us to raise $22.5 billion of committed capital for the successor funds, Americas XII and Asian III. The second is the growth in scaling of our newer initiatives. Five years ago, we didn't have any dedicated real estate capital. But on the back of strong performance in our first fund, today we have two real estate funds focused on the Americas, our European Fund, an opportunistic Real Estate Credit fund, as well as a REIT that listed in May. We've made significant progress and we have several businesses that fit this profile. And, finally, we've been active with a number of new strategic partnerships which are longer-term in nature than our traditional funds. And let me expand on this last thought. In Q3, you'll recall we finalized $7.5 billion of long-dated, multi-asset class partnerships with recycling. In Q4, we closed on $8.5 billion for our core investment strategy, including a $3 billion commitment from our balance sheet. As a reminder, our core investment business focuses on high quality investment opportunities in the private markets with longer estimated hold periods than our traditional fund investments. We closed on our first core investment in the second quarter of 2017 with an investment in USI, the insurance brokerage business. And in December, we announced our second core investment in PetVet, an operator of veterinary hospitals. All told, these strategic and core investment partnerships were responsible for about $16 billion of the $39 billion in new capital raised in 2017, and each have a fee and carry right on the third-party commitments. On the permanent capital front, today we have our REIT and our BDC Corporate Capital Trust, which listed in November. Combined, they account for more than $5 billion of permanent capital from which we receive management and incentive fees. And this will increase if and when we close the FS transaction that we announced in December. We expect the transaction, which accelerates the growth of our credit and Capital Markets platforms, to contribute an incremental $14 billion to our fee paying AUM profile and should close midway through the year. At that time, we also expect an increase in annual run rate fees by at least $120 million. You can see on page five that our fundraising efforts have increased our AUM and driven greater diversification across strategies, while maintaining attractive terms, as 80% off our AUM has the opportunity to earn performance fees. And the FS transaction, if and when it closes, will augment our credit assets by almost a third, which in turn will help increase our activity levels within our Capital Markets business, as Bill is going to talk about shortly. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. I'll start with the third thing we need to do well, which is find new investment opportunities. We invested $3.5 billion across businesses and geographies in the fourth quarter. Public Markets deployment was $1.2 billion, coming primarily from investments made in our direct lending and special sit strategies. On the Private Market side, we invested $2.3 billion. The largest contributors were two European infrastructure investments out of Infra II. We also deployed $1 billion in Private Equity, with two-thirds invested in North America and the balance in Asia. For the full year, we deployed over $18 billion, with nearly $10 billion coming from Private Equity. We had our busiest year ever in Asia, investing over $3 billion, with a particular focus on Japanese corporate carve-out opportunities. We were also active in infrastructure, investing in several large transactions where we submitted fully financed offers, underwrote a portion of the debt and delivered significant co-invest opportunities to our infrastructure investors. Shifting to monetizations, we continue to see a sizable level of exit activity across our PE business. For the quarter, we exited our investments in Visma and Gland Pharma and completed a number of secondaries, including our final exit from US Foods, resulting in over $300 billion in cash carry. On a blended basis, the PE exits were done at 2.3 times our cost. Looking at the full year, our Private Equity funds distributed over $11 billion of capital to our investors, which in turn contributed to roughly $1.2 billion of realized carry. And, finally, the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet, to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. Please turn to page 6 of the supplement, which profiles the growth of our Capital Markets segment. Q4 was a record quarter for our Capital Markets business, generating $140 million in revenue. For the full year, revenue more than doubled, with the team executing over 190 transactions. KCM has continued to be active in all geographies, in debt and equity, and in financing and syndication for KKR-led and third-party investments. Page 7 of the supplement summarizes our core fundamentals across the five categories. The power of our model is evident in our results and we're pleased with the progress and momentum we're seeing across the firm. Before I turn it over to Scott, I want to briefly discuss our thinking on KKR's corporate structure. As you may have seen in the earnings release, we've announced that senior management and our board members are analyzing the potential impact of a conversion from our partnership structure today to a C-Corp. So, what are some of the considerations? We've heard for some time that there are investors that find publicly-traded partnerships difficult to own. And when we look at our shareholder base, our institutional ownership is lower than most traditional corporations. So we think there's an opportunity for us to appeal to a broader audience. Offsetting this are lower reported after-tax earnings. Our fee-related earnings, for the most part, are already taxed as a corporate tax rate, so a change in our structure would most significantly impact our carried interest and investment income and whether these income streams are taxed at the corporate or the unitholder level. To try to help frame the numbers, if we restructured as a corporation and assumed the passage of tax reform at the beginning of 2017, we estimated our reported after-tax ENI would have been approximately 17% lower, or $1.98 per adjusted unit, compared to the $2.38 we reported for the year. Today, we're trading at roughly 9.3 times earnings on a trailing basis. So we need to see approximately two turns of multiple expansion, all else being equal, for a breakeven stock price. And on a DE basis, the initial dilution percentage-wise would likely be lower given tax attributes created in the conversion. We, as a management team, together with our board members, are carefully analyzing all the variables and considerations and we will keep you updated as we move forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Bill, and thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. Every quarter we throw a lot of numbers at you. There are cash outcomes, mark-to-market outcomes, two kinds of AUM, our balance sheet. There's a lot of information to digest. The volume of information runs the risk of being a distraction from the main messages we want you to take away. So we thought this quarter it would be a good idea to step back and tell you how we look at our business and what really matters. In that light, I want to spend a few minutes with you on how we think about KKR as investors and the largest owner of our own stock. First, please look at page 8 of the deck. Our AUM has been growing rapidly. As you can see on the slide, the average annual growth rate is 14% over the last four years and that's before the FS transaction. Even more exciting, our non-Private Equity businesses, which launched largely over the last decade, are beginning to scale with a 19% growth rate over the same period of time. And we see significant upside from here given the size of the end markets for these businesses and our relatively small market share today. Said simply, we're in a fast-growing industry with a lot of secular tailwinds and we are growing faster than the industry with a lot of potential ahead. Now flip to slide 9. Our management fees have been growing rapidly along with our AUM. And as you can see, our non-PE fees have grown even faster, again as our newer strategies have begun to scale. And remember, alongside of this growth, we've also seen revenues from our Capital Markets business increase threefold from 2013 to 2017. Now please turn to slide 10. Strategically, we have focused not only on growing our assets, but also increasing the duration of our assets. In particular, we've been focused on raising permanent capital and strategic partnership capital that has either recycling or a very long expected life of 15 years or more. As you can see on the slide, we've made good progress, in particular last year, when our assets with these attributes more than doubled from $11 billion to $28 billion, and if you include the impact of the FS transaction, $42 billion. Here again, we see significant potential to further scale this type of capital for the firm. And, finally, the other metric we look at is book value per share on a marked basis. While we believe ENI is a fairly volatile metric and not aligned with how we run our business, we don't get paid on marks. We get paid on cash outcomes. We do believe it is important to look at how our investments are performing and how our mark-to-market book value per share is progressing. We had a nice improvement last year, with book value growing over $2 per unit or 17%. The bottom line is that as we look at these fundamentals we feel good about how our business is growing and where we can go from here. It's pretty simple when you step back from it all. Last year was a particularly good year for us. We used our model well, we continued to scale our businesses and we raised a lot of capital, much of it on a permanent and very long-term basis. The key for 2018 is to continue all three and we feel well-positioned to do just that. Operator, we're happy to open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks a lot. Just I appreciate all the thinking on the conversion thought process. The part – my words, not yours – it feels like you'd actually like to do it if you knew you'd get to two turns. I'm curious on how you finish the thought process now, because you clearly did a lot of work to analyze and I think the world is at a similar point now. How does the final decision get made?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Glenn. This is Bill. That final decision, once we decide what to do, will be communicated to you. We just thought it was important to let you know that we're seriously considering it and have actually talked to our board members and they are talking to advisors to make sure that we make the right decision.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. We'll have an update for you next call, Glenn, but we just wanted to share that we're working actively with the board in analyzing all the trade-offs.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay, fair. It was worth a shot. One quickie, on the $8.5 billion raise you mentioned that $3 billion is coming from KKR balance sheet. Is that your best way to ensure better diversification of the balance sheet going forward? And for us, analysts and unitholders, is it the same economics whether you're adding on pieces to the balance sheet one piece at a time or a slug into a fund?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. I think in that last question, correct, you could think of it as, either way, we're making an investment in an underlying company, whether it's coming through a fund or, in this situation, alongside a couple strategic partners in more of a bespoke partnership. So yes, we end up with the same kind of net exposure to the underlying investment, but maybe I could step back for a second. I mean we have talked in the past a little bit about this core investment strategy. And the background is that we see a lot of opportunities where we find great businesses that we like, that are stable. We'd like to own them for a long time, but it's a bit lower risk and a bit lower return than what would fit into a traditional fund that we'd be normally managing. So historically we've passed on those opportunities. After doing that several times, we kind of asked ourselves why we didn't have a proper home for them. And so we created this strategy to be able to actually pursue those opportunities. So we'll be making a large investment off the balance sheet, $3 billion incremental, to the USI investment and then we found some like-minded partners, just two, to invest alongside us in this. And so that's where the $5.5 billion comes from that pays both a management fee and a carry. So implicitly the way you should think about it is it's an investment that we'll be making off the balance sheet that will increase our equity exposure over time, and we'll get some incremental economics from the third-party capital. And importantly, perhaps in terms of the thought of monetizing content already here, we're adding no direct head count in order to do this.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. Hey, guys. Why is the BDC structure viewed as a good way to grow private credit? I understand the tax benefits, but the vehicles themselves have had kind of a mixed track record with respect to performance and many of the public ones trade at discounts to book value. So if you can elaborate a little bit on that, it would be great.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Chris. It's Scott. Happy to do that. Look, I think the way that we look at it is having BDCs as part of our Private Credit platform makes a lot of sense. The underlying investments that we're making in that strategy tend not to have the duration that you'd seen in a lot of our other asset classes. So a lot of the assets may have a two, three year type duration, maybe a bit longer. And so, as you know, we do have private funds that have their typical episodic nature. We raise them. We invest them. They run off. But what happens as a result of the relatively short duration of the assets, you end up with teams on the road raising capital continuously, virtually. And so as we've thought about what's a proper funding structure over time for that underlying activity, having more permanency to the capital base makes a lot of sense to us to supplement the more episodic funds. The other thing I'd say is with the permanent capital structure you can be more creative and kind of raise a longer-term financing probably at a lower cost, all else equal. So that's another reason we think we can use that structure to drive better risk-adjusted net returns to investors over time. You are right. There at times when BDCs trade at a premium to book and there are times when they trade at a discount. The key, in our experience, is to generate the required dividend yield to investors to earn the right to have them trade at a premium. And that's our primary focus. But you'll see us scaling both the permanent parts of the Private Credit funding model and the more temporary.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And remember, Chris, from a KKR point of view, we are going to be the manager of these assets. So there is nothing better than to bring on permanent capital, because we will be managing these assets for those investors. And let's not forget. As we continue to grow our Capital Markets business, from an origination point of view that dovetails quite well into trying to grow our credit strategy.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So I just wanted to come back to C-Corp. If one of your partnership peers converted, re-rated higher, was added to some indexes, I mean this might take a little bit of time, but I imagine this would really probably help your case to convert. Or are you guys really thinking about your decision here more in isolation?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Craig, this is Bill. Again, we're just asking you to stay tuned. We mentioned in prepared remarks that we're seriously considering this. We'll take into account all variables going forward and we'll report back certainly next quarter.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Okay. And then just coming to the Capital Markets business then, really, really strong year. From a modeling perspective, what's the right way to think about the run rate here? And I'm looking at 2018, just with how much growth you've seen, but also thinking about where we are in the cycle and also thinking about future growth here.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, on that point, it's tough to give you a run rate. The only thing that I could share, and I'll let Scott chime in a little bit later, is that the model has expanded both from third-party investors as well as geographically. You could see that for 2017. And the $440 million number, roughly 23% of that came from third-party. That was a nascent business as far as KCM was concerned a few years ago. In addition, when you look at that $440 million, 50% of it roughly came from outside the U.S. And so we've had Capital Markets platform around for eight years. It's really hitting its stride. Everything in 2017 worked quite well. And so, I would say that if you look at 2010 through 2016, those would be the old numbers. As we continue to grow KKR as an enterprise and we do more things, I would expect that there would be a new number that you should model, but I'm not willing to share what number you should use.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Craig. It's Scott. Just a couple things I would add on. Some things have fundamentally changed in our business. One is the scale of the Private Credit effort that we have. So, that business has been growing rapidly. A lot of that will show up in the third-party part of the business. But with our new partners, FS, we now have even more capital to pursue large opportunities. And so working together, we think this is a market where scale begets scale. And we're one of the few parties that can actually underwrite $500 million plus debt underwritings for third-parties. And you'll be seeing us do that even more actively than we have in the past. That tends to also lead to syndication opportunities for us, because these larger deals tend to have a large hold component and a large syndication component. That was not really the case in our business three to five years ago. So we think there is a step function change in what we can do in the third-party side as we work together with FS. Second thing I'd say is we're just using the model better across the firm. So last year, if you look at what really moved the needle, there was the normal activity in terms of our underlying portfolio companies doing financings, doing IPOs, doing secondaries. But then what you also had was new transactions. Last year in particular you had Japanese corporate carve-outs with big equity syndication and you had European infrastructure transactions with big equity syndications. We talked in the past about Q-Park as a prime example of one of those situations. And that was not the case a couple years ago either. So our newer businesses are now using the Capital Markets model quite actively. It used to just be Private Equity, but we're now seeing that spread across the firm and, importantly, globally. And so it is not something that we're going to predict in terms of our revenue level for 2018. But when you look at the chart on page 6, I do think you should keep those things in mind as to why we think we're no longer in this zone of $200 million in revenue a year, but something quite a bit higher.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Scott. Very helpful.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions and I appreciate the brevity of your remarks, very good stuff. So first question is just in terms of payout policy, just given your growth, diversification, increasing growth coming from more permanent, longer-dated vehicles, wondering how we should be thinking about the $0.17 quarterly dividend. And then how might that change as you're talking through the C-Corp conversion? And obviously we'll wait until second quarter to get that as well, but just thinking what might be the shift there.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Good question, Bill, and obviously this goes hand-in-hand. Typically what we would have done if we weren't contemplating going C-Corp is probably on this call we would give you a new number for 2018. But because they go hand-in-hand, once we decide what we are going to do from a corporate structure, we will then communicate what the new distribution policy or the new dividend number will be.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, appreciate the momentum of the franchise. Maybe on a bit more concrete basis as you think out for 2018, 2019, where do you see the greatest opportunity to gather assets, apart from leveraging Franklin Square?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Why don't you take...?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Bill, it's Craig. Why don't I start with that? I think in terms of episodic funds, if we look in Private Markets, the list would include our Infrastructure, European Private Equity and Energy Income and Growth strategies, and in Public Markets would include Lending strategies in the U.S. and Europe. And this would be in addition to areas where we look to raise capital on a more continuous basis, so that would include the CLO business, the leverage credit platforms in the U.S. and Europe, and you mentioned the BDCs as well as the hedge fund partnerships. And, of course, any new strategic partnership activity would be incremental to this. And from a management fee standpoint, it's worth remembering, back to page 4, that we have about $20 billion of capital that's in our AUM that pays management fees on an as-invested basis. So that will transition as we make investments and it will also begin generating management fees as that investment occurs. And then you mentioned FS correctly. And we'll see a $14 billion increase once that – on that pending transaction in fee paying in the $120 million of revenues associated with those assets.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yes, just a couple of thoughts to add to that, Bill. I mean we remain in a robust fundraising environment. If you really just step way back from the quarter or the year, over the last four years, we've raised over $100 billion. And that was during a period of time, if you think about it, where we had a lot of young businesses, Fund I, Fund II type strategies, and also while we were growing our investor base by investing in our sales team. So suffice it to say we feel good about where we can go from here as we keep generating investment performance.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Just one on the C-Corp, I appreciate the review. Is it technically possible for you to do that for 2018, or even if your decision -decides to move to that, is it more like a – would it have to be like a 2019 and forward event?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: From a technical point of view, if we decided to do it, it would happen and could happen in 2018.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then maybe just broadly on the Capital Markets strategy. Thanks for all that color, Scott, on that. That was helpful. As you think about – your business has definitely evolved pretty substantially in a lot of different ways over the last few years, including the Capital Markets. And as you think about evolving it over the next say, three to five years, how should we be thinking about the growth of that Capital Markets business in terms of how it will compete with the investment banks? Given 23% is now third-party, could that third-party component of that business say, three to five years out, be half or more and compete – be much more in the league with the traditional investment banks?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: It's a good question, Brian. I'd say, first off, we're not trying to compete with the investment banks. They've got a lot more resources and a lot more capital than we do. What we're really focused on is having our Capital Markets business help facilitate the activities of our investment business and help drive returns in our investment business. So when we're looking at a new transaction, we'll speak for equity and debt and help drive the syndication of those, so that ends up in the right hands and we can maximize economics and control for the firm. It also allows us to do transactions we otherwise could not do. The example last year of the European infrastructure transactions that were two or three (33:07) transactions, when our entire fund size was $3 billion. So we're able to actually complete transactions and control companies by using that model. So, for the most part, our activities are focused around facilitating the investment business of the firm. It also allows us to grow those businesses faster. So if you think about it, you had a $3 billion Infrastructure Fund II. And if you can actually show that you can do multiple large transactions, that you need a lot more capital than $3 billion, it allows you to raise a much larger Fund III potentially because you have proof of concept that you can put that money to work. So it helps drive the growth of those businesses through the activities that we're able to conduct. And then also, frankly, from the standpoint of driving returns, we can control the boards of these companies and it's much easier when a CEO has one partner to talk to as opposed to multiple. We are, though, also spending time working with third-parties but a lot of that third-party activity is helping to drive flow for our Private Credit businesses and other investing businesses. So a lot of the activity, especially in 2017, was with third-party financial sponsors. So we will help finance their transactions. And the way this works is we try to give them the best advice in terms of what we would do if we were them, and we will source an opportunity if they want to work with us. And then our credit teams will have the opportunity to decide whether they want to invest in that sourced opportunity. And we're big believers that the more that we have in terms of pipeline and the more ideas we have flying into the top of the funnel, the better the investment opportunities we'll see over time. Sometimes we will hold a piece of those credits we originate and sometimes we won't and we'll syndicate 100% to third-parties. So our activities are really more focused around those areas as opposed to try to have a much broader suite of activities like the investment banks do. That's not our aspiration. But I think what you will see is, as we scale real estate, infrastructure, energy, credit globally, private equity globally, our other efforts that we're going to build over time, you'll see Capital Markets a big part of those efforts as we continue to scale and do larger transactions and in effect punch above our weight, which should help us grow AUM faster.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's super helpful. I'll get back in the queue for a follow-up. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Sorry to beat the C-Corp horse again, but just kind of curious. Maybe, Bill, as part of your internal conversations about this, is there any thought or benefit that you guys see to changing over to a Method I accounting as part of any potential corporate structure change?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: No, Rob. It's interesting and it's a good point. We actually kicked that around. So, again, if we decide to change our corporate structure, we're thinking about a lot of things as we're going to be reaching out to potentially new investors. And so that would address reporting. And one of the things that we did take a look at is whether or not Method I as opposed to Method II was what I would say less volatile. And suffice to say that the decision was made that we're going to continue to use Method II, because that really shows the true economics and the true mark-to-market and the real reality of how our business is performing.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then maybe shifting gears, I'm just interested in maybe getting an update or your thoughts on – you have this joint venture with FS coming up soon. But beyond the BDCs, more broadly, could you maybe give us a sense of what other opportunities you see with FS and how that's kind of dovetailing or maybe spearheading some of your initiatives into, say, the high net worth channel or the retail channel? Just kind of where you envision that heading.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, happy to take that. So in terms of the broader retail high net worth question, we've really got several different approaches. The first of which, we have a team inside the firm that spends all their time talking to family offices and high net worth individuals. So we've got the direct approach, where we're working with a number of families around the world and they are investing with us across a variety of different strategies and parts of what we do. We also have a long list of relationships in the platform channel. So think of this as banks, high net worth third-party platforms where we sell our product through their sales force. And so that's also been growing quite rapidly. So there's a direct, there's platform, and both of those are now being conducted on a global basis. And then we'll also work with partners. We have a strong penchant here to only have inside KKR what needs to be inside KKR and we think there's others that are great at what they do. FS is a good example of that. They have built out a lot of capabilities and have a few hundred people that spend their time focused on being best in class in administering, running and selling these more permanent capital structures to an audience of hundreds of thousands of retail investors. They are better at that than we could ever hope to be. And so we are partnering with them on the existing what will now be a combined six BDC vehicles. And we are talking about other products we can create together where we can marry our two capabilities and find a path to their channels in something that will be differentiated. So more to come on that, but we do think that's a growth opportunity for us. I'd say more broadly we kind of went from a standing start in this retail high net worth channel probably five, six years ago, and it now is probably 10% to 20% of the money we raise in any given quarter is coming from that. And with FS I expect that will go up.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. Good morning, guys. One more on the C-Corp and hopefully that will be the last one. The other comps seem to be pretty concerned about the current shareholders and felt like their current shareholders actually like the structure, which you don't seem to be as concerned about. Is there something different about the makeup or opinion of your shareholder base that maybe is thinking about this trade-off differently?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Patrick, it's Craig. I guess I don't have a point of view as it relates to our peers and the nature of their shareholder base. But I think suffice to say that this is a topic that has been written about by you and your peers for some time now. And I've never thought of our shareholders as being shy in sharing their points of view with us. But in terms of whether there is a difference, tough to comment on. But, of course, we're taking into account all factors as we think through a potential conversion.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Thanks. And just as my quick follow-up, could you give us an idea of how much of the 43 million National Vision shares are actually in the funds? Because it's a pretty big needle-mover now given how much it was up.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Virtually all.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Yes. I think of that as a fund investment, Patrick.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: So there's not a lot of co-invest from third-parties in that 43 million number?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Not that I'm aware of.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: But honestly I don't have that information in front. But when you think about KKR's ownership, to be clear, National Vision is held in a fund, not on the balance sheet, if that's what you're driving at.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: There's a GP commitment to that fund, but there's no co-invest in addition to that.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. Perhaps pivoting a little bit in the other direction from the C-Corp conversation, Bill, maybe you could talk a little bit about how the change in corporate tax could impact your earnings, recognizing obviously revenue mix is going to be a factor, but for the next 12 months or looking out over the next couple of years in the current structure?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: In the current structure, when you take a look at what we historically reported, our effective tax rate ranges anywhere in between 5% and 10%. And that was with a corporate rate of roughly 35%. Under the current structure, if we were to remain a PTP, because the corporate rate went from 35% down to 21%, that 5% to 10% would be discounted from a corporate level and so that would probably then step down to anywhere in between 3% and 8%.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Okay, helpful. And maybe as a follow-up just with respect to the balance sheet composition, just kind of looking quarter-over-quarter, cash looks like it's down a little bit, energy up, other up significantly. And apologies if I missed this or just didn't catch it, but can you perhaps talk a little bit about what's really driving that other quarter-over-quarter for up to over $700 million, if I have my numbers here right?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. And specifically we're talking about page 12, the other.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: That's correct.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And what's in that number is liquid securities that don't actually fall naturally into any category up above. And so suffice to say that they are all liquid securities and that this number moves up from time to time as we try to actively manage our portfolio. So it wouldn't be sitting in cash, but again, in liquid securities. And I would expect that number to be somewhat down next quarter based upon the activity we're seeing in the first quarter.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Disdier from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So to piggyback on Patrick's question before, just thinking about some of the visible fee activity thus far in 2018, would you be able to provide any comments or detail around realization activity you've seen this quarter? And thinking from a closed transaction perspective and then also announced but not yet closed, so Pets, Aricent, PetVet, and then Unilever spreads on the Capital Markets side, kind of...
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: I'll bifurcate that question into two separate answers. One has to do with fee income and the other really has to do for 2018 what sort of performance income and what sort of balance sheet activity has taken place. And so as we stand here today, assuming all the investments that have been announced close, the cash generation from an income point of view is going to be roughly $175 million. Away from that, we generally don't talk about fee income. If you look at our fee-related earnings, you could assume that certainly the management fees are on somewhat of a run rate basis. More specifically to your question, embedded in that fee income is Capital Markets activities. We're not going to give you a number quarter-to-quarter, somewhere intra-quarter, what the final quarter number would be, other than to just say that the Capital Markets arm of the KKR enterprise is off to a very nice start, like the deployment and the monetization so far to-date.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it, understood. And then on the $20 billion of capital commitments and the associated 100 basis point weighted average fee, would you be able to stratify that between Private and Public, and then the associated fee rates with each of the buckets? And then, if I'm correct, that's moved up from $14.5 billion last quarter, so I guess how much is new money versus the continuous build?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, the number continues to build. And keep in mind we have that shadow AUM that turns into fee paying AUM as we deploy it, and then we raise more AUM. But very specifically to your question, of the $20 billion that Craig mentioned earlier, $14 billion is in Private Markets and the other $6 billion is in Public Markets. And when you think about that 100 basis points, in both of those categories that 100 basis points is the same. So a lot of the capital in Public Markets is long-dated, locked up capital where we receive a management fee and performance income. And, again, whether or not it's in Private Markets or Public Markets, it's roughly about 100 basis points.
Andrew Paul Disdier - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning. This is Mike Needham in for Mike Carrier. First, just on core investment strategy, can you provide a few more details on the $8.5 billion, or the management fees and carry rate on the third-party stuff? And then, like, return targets and when fees ultimately show.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Mike, Scott. Let's break it down. So, first, you've got – of the $8.5 billion, $3 billion is coming from our balance sheet, so third-party capital is $5.5 billion. Return expectations on that would be in the teens. So not kind of high teens to 20% plus you'd expect in PE, more like mid-teens, give or take, in terms of return profile. The way we think about it is if the balance sheet investment generates mid-teens, because obviously we're not burdened by the management fees and carry ourselves, and then we can generate economics on the third-party capital, we think we can blend that mid-teens to a 20% or so total ROE figure on the $3 billion commitment to the strategy. The third-party economics we're not going to share publicly but they are in line with what you'd normally see in a fund construct for core funds with some innovations that we've built in that we're not going to share.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. That sounds good. The only other one I had was on incentive fees for Public Markets. They were it seemed like a little bit high at $65 million. Is that unusually high or does it just kind of reflect the progress you've made in that business, like a reasonably good year for the hedge funds? So is like that $65 million kind of in line with what you expect going forward?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Michael, this is Bill. As we said historically, when you think about the strategic partnerships that we have in certain hedge funds, the incentive fees typically land in either June, with PAAMCO Prisma Capital that we have invested with them, and all of the other hedge funds come in, in December. So what you'll actually see is, really from an incentive fee point of view, no activity in the first and third quarter, some activity again just around PAAMCO Prisma in the second quarter, with all the other strategic partnerships, and there are five in total. And that's what generated that $60 million plus this quarter.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yes, I'd say the standout – Marshall Wace had a particularly good year.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask you guys around capital management, just to follow up on one of the earlier questions. So I hear you on the dividend, obviously kind of depending on C-Corp. But I guess if I look at the exit activity, clearly picking up. Accrued carry I think is up 10-ish-percent quarter-over-quarter. Some of the larger funds, whether it's NAXI or Asia II, are both doing extremely well. So I guess as we think about the fact that we're still kind of early in the realization cycle for you guys, anything new you're thinking about in terms of retaining capital on balance sheet or returning it back to shareholders? Whether it's buybacks or more sort of a systematic special, or is that all sort of all on the table pending C-Corp conversion?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, it's on the table pending C-Corp conversion, but when you think about the way we manage our business is a lot different than the other alternative asset managers. And we made that conscious decision back in 2015 to pay out a regular way distribution that was predictable and taking the excess to do two things. One is to continue to put that capital back on our balance sheet and compound it, and from time to time use some of that capital in the way of buybacks. And so I don't think anything has changed and probably won't change if we go to a C-Corp but that's...
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: If we go C-Corp.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Right.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, all clear. Bill, another quick follow-up for you. I think I heard you say the impact from a potential C-Corp conversion on DE would be lower than it would be obviously under ENI. Sounds like some of the benefits, some of the blockers, will retain – you guys will retain those if you were to convert. Any sense of what the, if converted, DE tax rate would be since that's obviously going to dictate the actual cash flows of the business?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: No, Alex. That's just too hard to predict. The only point we mentioned when we were talking about TDE, actually that tax rate actually going a little lower, is that if we were to become a C-Corp the assets would get stepped-up. And as we sold those assets over the first couple of years, the cash taxes that would we do would be far lower than the amount of taxes that we would accrue on appreciation in the portfolio vis-à-vis ENI. Make sense?
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the interest income and dividends in the quarter. They just looked a little bit more elevated at $90 million, a little above the pace that we've seen in recent quarters. Just curious what drove that and how we should think about a good run rate pace going forward from here?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Michael. What I would use as a run rate is anywhere in between $65 million to $85 million, only for the fact that there are certain anomalies in each and every quarter. And you are right. What ended up happening in this particular quarter you saw an elevation on the dividend. We had a couple of recaps that were done in the funds and those economics flowed through to us vis-à-vis our carry as dividend income. And likewise, on the balance sheet, to the extent that we have our ownership interest in the fund or we might have a co-invest it showed up in that number. But, again, I would say the run rate number should again be anywhere in between that $65 million and $85 million.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. And just as a quick follow-up here, just on the balance sheet this quarter, can you talk about how much was deployed and monetized from the balance sheet? Just trying to get a better understanding in terms of the moving pieces all around the balance sheet. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. In the quarter itself, I don't think there is anything that I would call out as particularly abnormal activity. We had normal drawdowns from our underlying GP commitments to funds and then normal monetizations from the standpoint of what we were invested in alongside the funds. So there is nothing that I'd particularly call out. And actually if you look at capital deployed and realizations, they're pretty equivalent. So we kind of sold as much as we invested in the quarter.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Right. And to drill down on the number a little bit more, being that you asked, on page 8, where you see TDE, the realized gains off the balance sheet were roughly about $30 million. And when you take a look at the increase of the assets from a deployment point of view, everything is up quite modestly, other than what was referenced a little bit earlier in that other in the total investment, that $700 million. That's where you saw an uptick of roughly about $250 million. But if you look at Private Equity, you look at Real Assets, you look at Credit, they are all up quite modestly as far as net increase in those strategies quarter-over-quarter.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Some of this is answered. It was around the core investment strategy. I guess, more broadly, just thinking about the pace of growth of fee paying AUM, first, if you could comment on sort of a range or a view of that $20 billion of commitments turning on and generating fees over the next couple of years. And then a little bit more broadly, the potential sort of long-term growth outlook for the strategic partnership strategy and the core investment strategy. And maybe just a little bit of differentiation of how you think about those two different areas separately.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Brian. This is Bill. I'll take the first one and then I'll pass the second one off to Scott. And when you look at the $20 billion of capital commitment that's yet to earn fees, away from the core – and Scott had mentioned earlier the breakdown is $5.5 billion of capital was actually raised and we're going to get paid a fee as that capital is deployed. So set that aside, we're talking about the remaining $15 billion, again, in Private Markets and Public Markets. And we would assume that capital, again, at roughly 100 basis points, will get deployed anywhere between years two, three and four.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say on the second question, we do look at them a bit differently. So when we say strategic investor partnerships, what we tend to be talking about there are very long-term partnerships with recycling, so that we have an ability to recycle capital, plus a percentage of the profits for extended period of time. And the expected duration of those partnerships is somewhere in the 20 to 30-year range, beginning to end. The underlying strategies that those partnerships invest in are usually broad-based across the firm and there's some mix of Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit. And so that's where the strategic partnership is in our definition. And obviously having the 20 to 30-year visibility on capital that can scale as we perform is particularly powerful for us. The core strategy is something that's a bit distinct. That is that long-term investment that I mentioned that we used to pass on, that we now have an ability to pursue. We happen to create that strategy with two close strategic partners of the firm but it's very focused on that longer-term investment. It does not have the recycling aspect but does have an expected hold period that can be 15-years or more. And to be clear, there is the $8.5 billion that we're talking about today but then we also have our partnership with the case where we made the investment in USI, which was $1 billion in aggregate between us and them. So if you put it all together, it's $9.5 billion for core, but it is a slightly distinct strategy from the strategic partnerships which have recycling, core less so. It's just longer-term hold. Is that clear?
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. That's extremely helpful. Just maybe the long-term growth prospect of this, as you think about this type of business and the attractiveness of this structure, say, again over the next say three years, is it something that you think you can enter in with more partners and look to extend that substantially?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yes. I'd say a slightly different answer for each. I'd say core, we are going to be deploying that capital over the next three to five years and before it probably makes sense to create more dedicated capital. We'll see how the deployment pace looks. Not to say we wouldn't do other things alongside or expand that, but the base case expectation is that money will get invested over the next several years and then we'll figure out where to go from there and hopefully scale the strategy from that point forward. Strategic partnerships is something that we want to continue to scale on a more continuous basis. They take a long time. They are highly complex. They tend to be several billion dollars in size. And so at any given moment, we're working on several of those with close partners of the firm. So that's much more continuous in nature versus core.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. That's helpful. Thank you so much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, everybody. We look forward to giving you an update next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the KKR's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, conference will be open for questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Daniel. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release and the supplementary presentation, which are available on the Investor Center section at kkr.com. The call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. In terms of our progress this quarter, most significantly, we continue to increase the earnings power of the firm evidenced by the $7 billion of new strategic investor partnerships closed on in Q3. While the headline amount alone from these partnerships is meaningful, the opportunity for us is even greater because of two things. The first is recycling, where cost, together with the percentage of gains, will go back into the partnership to be invested again. And the second is the longer expected life of these partnerships. We expect them to be over 20 years in duration. As a result, there's the opportunity to see that $7 billion compound over a long period of time, and with performance for our total economics to be more than three times that, relative to capital committed to a traditional drawdown fund. It's very positive for us. And Scott's going to spend a few more minutes at the end of our prepared remarks to give some additional color. Let's now go to Page 2 of the supplement, with an overview of our performance. We reported after-tax economic net income of $308 million for the quarter, which translates into $0.36 of after-tax ENI for adjusted unit. And over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $1.9 billion of after-tax ENI. After-tax distributable earnings were $464 million for the quarter or $0.57 on a per adjusted unit basis; and we've generated over $1.5 billion of after-tax DE over the trailing 12 months. Also of note, we've had meaningful AUM and fee paying AUM growth over the last 12 months. And you're seeing this growth flow through to our financials. Management fees for the quarter were up 16% on a year-over-year basis; and fee-related earnings were up 35% year-over-year, driven both by the growth in management fees, as well as continued strong performance within capital markets. Cutting through it, there are five things that we need to do well: one, generate investment performance; two, raise capital; three, find attractive new investments; four, monetize existing investments; and finally, we need to use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet. I'll update you on our progress on the first two, and Bill's going to cover the remaining three. Please look at Page 3 of the supplement. We've had strong performance across our asset classes in the last 12 months. In private equity, our three flagship funds had appreciated 20% on a blended basis; and our real asset strategies are performing with our more mature real estate, infrastructure, and energy flagship funds, up 13%, 21%, and 29%, respectively. And in credit, we continue to see strong performance in our opportunistic credit and direct lending platforms, in particular. The second thing we need to do well is raise capital. And you can see our progress here on Page 4 of the supplement. We've had strong organically driven fundraising momentum with AUM and fee paying AUM, up 17% and 22%, respectively, in the last 12 months. And looking over a longer period of time, as you can see on the bottom half of the slide, our growth since 2010 has been significant, with AUM and fee paying AUM more than doubling. Turning to Page 5, you can see that not only have we become larger, but we've become meaningfully more diversified across strategies and geographies with a vast majority of our capital and funds that are not subject to redemption, and with a growing percentage of capital coming from longer-term strategic investor partnerships with recycling. In terms of the quarter, more specifically, our growth in AUM was driven by $8 billion of new capital raised that included the impacts of these strategic partnerships with recycling, the final close of our first Real Estate Credit Opportunity Partners Fund, and inflows in CLOs and alternative credit. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. I'll pick up on the third thing we need to do well: find new, compelling investment opportunities. This was an active deployment quarter for us across the firm with a total of $4.6 billion deployed across businesses and geographies. Public markets deployment was $1.6 billion, coming from investments made across our alternative credit vehicles, primarily with indirect lending. Deployment in these strategies contributed to the increase in Public Markets' fee paying AUM. On the Private Markets side, we invested $3 billion, driven by investments in private equity across all three geographies as well as infrastructure. The largest investment related to Internet Brands' acquisition of WebMD. Internet Brands has been an existing portfolio company of ours since 2014. So, we're effectively investing like it's strategic in a transaction with meaningful synergies. In total, the $4.6 billion in deployment across Private and Public Markets still leaves us with over $47 billion of dry powder across the firm as of September 30. And over $14 billion of that will begin to pay management fees as it's invested at a blended rate of approximately 100 basis points. The fourth thing we need to do well is monetize our existing investments. We are continuing to see significant monetization activity across our PE business. In total, realization events in several portfolio companies drove a 58% increase in cash carry compared to last quarter. The PE exits were diversified between strategic and secondary activity; and on a blended basis, PE exits were down at 2.7 times our cost. The last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. The power of our model is evident in our results. Over the last 12 months, our book value per unit is up 15%; and we generated a 19% ROE on an after-tax ENI basis. Please turn to page 6 of the supplement, which summarizes our core fundamentals across the five categories. We are pleased with our progress and the momentum we're seeing across the firm. Now, let me go into segment financials in more detail. Management, monitoring and transaction fees were $356 million in total, up 29% year-over-year, with a 16% year-to-year increase in management fees, as Craig touched on earlier. In terms of transaction fees, we reported $179 million of fees this quarter driven by equity investments into two large North America private equity deals and our continued momentum within our Capital Markets segment. Page 7 of the supplement profiles the growth of the KCM segment. Year-to-date, we've executed over 140 transactions generating revenues at $300 million, more than double the same period last year. On the bottom half of the page, you can see that KCM has continued to be active in all geographies, in debt and equity, and in financing and syndication for KKR-led and third-party investments. And as we said here today, KCM's momentum and overall level activity is continuing into the fourth quarter. Turning to performance income. We reported $364 million, which was anchored by a robust level of realization activity with over $400 million of realized carried interest in the quarter. Investment income came in at $50 million, with $76 million of realized gains, including our first secondary at First Data. Bringing it all together, on a total segment basis, fee-related earnings came in at $192 million; our after-tax distributable earnings were $464 million, and after-tax ENI of $308 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks Bill. Hi, everybody. I just want to hit on two topics today. The first is some background and an update on our work with a handful of LPs to create long-term recycling strategic investor partnerships. The second is some detail on how we're using our balance sheet to grow our firm, in particular, our AUM and fee-related profits. Let's start with the strategic partnerships with our LPs. By way of background, a lot of the capital we manage is in long-term fund or separate account format, not subject to redemption. Most of these vehicles have a contractual three to six-year investment period and an expected life of 6 to 12 years. As such, we have long-term visibility on our management fees and AUM from the vast majority of the capital that we manage. As we've grown, we've evolved our thinking strategically, with a view of supplementing our traditional long-term fund capital to the development of even longer-term partnerships, plus permanent capital. On the permanent capital front, today, we have our REIT, which went public earlier this year; and our BDC, which has begun its listing process. Combined, they account for more than $5 billion of permanent capital, from which we derive management fees and incentive fees. We're focused on growing that $5 billion figure. We've also been focused on creating strategic partnerships with a small group of limited partners. These partnerships are all customized, but have some common characteristics. They have longer lives than traditional fund structures. Most have an expected life of 20 to 30 years. They invest across multiple asset classes, many encompass private equity, credit, and real assets. They have recycling provisions that allow us to recycle cost, plus a percentage of the profits that we generate. As a result, the better we perform, the more capital we have to redeploy for a very long period of time. They're large scale. So far, we generally target these partnerships for $3 billion or more each. And they have discounted pricing for the partner in return for them committing large-scale capital for a long time. From KKR's standpoint, these partnerships are accretive, given the aggregate economics we generate from the sizable commitments and the visibility of funding we have across multiple asset classes and fundraising cycles. Overall, these partnerships give us the opportunity to more than triple the economics relative to a traditional fund. In Q3, we signed two new strategic partnerships with these attributes and upsized an existing partnership for a combined $7.5 billion. $2.4 billion of this was already in our AUM last quarter; and $1.7 billion was in our fee paying AUM. The rest is additional capital that's new AUM this quarter. The entire $7.5 billion is subject to recycling provisions, which will grow with performance and will be invested in our strategies over time. So, this brings us to over $12 billion of recycling strategic investor partnership capital, and we're focused on growing that figure over time as well. Given this progress, we have more visibility on our revenues and capital base now than ever before. And we have more line of sight to capital, not just for the next 10 years, which is typical for us, but for the next 20 to 30 years. We'll keep you posted as we continue to raise more permanent and long-term recycling capital. But we wanted to make sure you know that this is a strategic priority for us, and that we're making progress. The second topic I want to discuss is how we're using our balance sheet to scale our AUM and fees. I'm going to walk through three examples of how we've used the balance sheet to accelerate growth and diversify our business. Take a look at page 8 of the deck for the first example. We've been using our balance sheet aggressively to create and scale new businesses. You can see on the left-hand side of the slide all the businesses the balance sheet has helped create, including strategies across real assets, like real estate equity and credit, and infrastructure. The balance sheet's also been part of creating businesses across our credit and growth platforms and is a driver of our Capital Markets business. In short, we've used the balance sheet to scale our business and diversify the revenue of the firm. The aggregate impact of this repositioning is shown on the right-hand side of the slide. You can see how the split of our AUM has evolved since we've had the balance sheet. In 2010, we were 72% private equity and 28% non-private equity. Today, the majority of our AUM is outside of private equity. The bottom right of the slide shows the picture on a fee basis. Not only are we seeing significant aggregate growth since 2010, but also a significant diversification of our fees across asset classes and activities in both AUM-related management fees and fees from our Capital Markets business. The balance sheet has allowed us to create and begin to scale virtually all of the businesses we've shown here, driving meaningful AUM and fee growth, diversifying our business and positioning us for further growth. Now, please take a look at page 9. We've also used the balance sheet to create a strategic partnership with another asset manager. Two years ago we acquired 24.9% of Marshall Wace and we expect to increase our ownership to 29.9% this year. The results of Marshall Wace and our other strategic investments show up in our AUM and fee results. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, Marshall Wace has significantly grown its assets, 57% growth over the last two years, from $22 billion to $34 billion. This growth results from capitalizing on its competitive advantages in systems, process and controls to generate strong investment performance. Marshall Wace is already a meaningful contributor to our AUM and fee-related earnings, and has made us a real player in the direct hedge fund space. As important, the team at Marshall Wace have been fantastic partners and are making us better investors and more thoughtful business builders. We mention this for a couple of reasons. First, we haven't talked in detail about Marshall Wace, and given its importance to us, we wanted everyone to know that it's going well. And second, it's a great example of us using the balance sheet to scale our AUM and fee earnings. Marshall Wace does not show up in our balance sheet investments or investment income, but it does show up in our AUM and fee related earnings, driving our fee growth and diversity. Finally, in addition to creating and scaling businesses and creating AUM and fee-enhancing partnerships, we've also used our balance sheet to facilitate new investments and capture more economics from those investments. For an illustration of this, please turn to page 10 of the deck. Earlier this month, we closed an infrastructure investment in Europe in a company called Q-Park, which is one of the largest parking operators in Europe. As you can see in this slide, this was a €3 billion transaction, requiring €1.8 billion of equity and €1.2 billion of debt. The process was competitive and being able to move quickly was a critical component of our success. The only challenge was that while the deal needed €1.8 billion of equity, our Infrastructure II fund is only $3 billion in total size. To keep the fund properly diversified, our team was comfortable with about a €300 million fund position, meaning we were €1.5 billion in equity short of what was required. With our balance sheet plus Capital Markets model, we were able to syndicate most of the excess equity to co-investors before signing, and we underwrote a portion of the debt as well, ultimately submitting a fully-financed offer that allowed us to prevail in the process. By using, our model we were able to lock down the entire deal quickly and win the asset for our Infrastructure II fund. We were able to have a pro forma board which is largely governed by us without other firms or third parties involved, in effect, we control the company. And we were able to deliver significant co-invest opportunity to our infrastructure investors, allowing us to highlight our strong sourcing capabilities and demonstrate that our infrastructure platform can support even larger fund sizes in the future. The model is powerful. It allowed us to move quickly and win the asset on behalf of our limited partners, while allowing the firm to create more economics for facilitating the transaction. None of this indicated equity or debt shows up in our AUM. But the fee economics are meaningful and the carry opportunity from owning the asset in the fund is significant. Part of the reason for our growth the last several years is that we're using this model of AUM, Capital Markets and balance sheet with greater effectiveness and frequency in multiple asset classes on a global basis. In effect, we're giving ourselves a competitive advantage by using our model more, which allows us to make more money from ideas we're pursuing and scale our businesses faster. In summary, our model is not just about investing more in what we do. That's part of our strategy. But the more significant part is that the model allows us to have a competitive advantage in the market by using our culture, capital and syndication capabilities to aggressively pursue investments we like, which allows us to generate better returns and more profit from every investment we make. In short, and as shown on page 11, we're growing rapidly and have real momentum. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: 
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And Daniel, we've got quite a number of people in the queue. So, if we could ask everyone to please ask one question and a follow-up, if necessary, and then, get back into the queue, we'd appreciate it.
Operator: And our first question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. Yeah. Maybe, first question, just on the investment income or the balance sheet results. You guys noted during the quarter, I think, there's some weak investments on the credit side. Just any color on that? I know the long-term, like the last 12 months, it's still a strong performance overall for the balance sheet. But just any color in terms of what weighed on it, and then, maybe on the outlook, meaning anything that's longer term or just some short-term quarter issues?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Mike, this is Bill. There's no issue with regard to the credit on the balance sheet results, certainly, over the year-to-date numbers. When you look at the balance sheet results just this particular quarter, a lot of the large positions that we've had, and if you take a look on page 12, we went out to top five. Most of those investments were either flat or down modestly, which drove just roughly a 1% return on the balance sheet. But more importantly, if you look over the year-to-date numbers of the balance sheet, balance sheet is up 12% which is in line with our expectations.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Okay. And then, Scott, maybe just on the strategic accounts, obviously, big quarter. Just from a deployment, is it similar to how you guys run sort of the carry funds, meaning you're going to be deploying that over a period of three to four years or do you have more flexibility just given that it's cross assets and it's much broader?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the question, Mike. I'd say it varies a bit. A significant amount of capital, you're right, it will get committed to underlying funds over the next two, three years, most likely, and then, will be drawn down from there. Generally, the economics flow in a similar way to the underlying funds but we do have some elements of these strategic partnerships which are more opportunistic. We have some that are going to be invested more immediately. And so, it really does vary. But I'd say the majority of it is going to be committed and drawn over time and a portion of it, a minority portion of it will get to work much more rapidly.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And Michael, just one little detail, we talked about this $7 billion. We've been working on these strategic partnerships for the better part of the year. $2 billion of that $7 billion is already in AUM and it's already being deployed. So when you look at the AUM table, you can see that we raised more than $7 billion this particular quarter in AUM. Only $5 billion of the $7 billion is showing up in AUM because we've already recognized $2 billion, and more importantly, we've already got to work on deploying that capital.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. It makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is now open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions, as well, this morning. Scott, sort of curious or a bit, perhaps, you spend some time talking about the leveraging of the platform through KCM. Just wondering if you can give us sort of a sense of the strength in the third quarter. How much of that reflects just sort of the backdrop of very robust markets and a pick up of activity, versus a more systemic yield concept, just sort of coming off the business? I'm trying to get a sense of how sustainable the transaction revenues are at this level.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill. I'd say there's a couple things going on. One, I'd say we're using the overall model with much more frequency, just generally speaking. So when we're looking at a new transaction across asset classes, our basic approach now is to work with our Capital Markets business and our balance sheet to make sure that if there's an equity syndication opportunity, we're capturing it early, and if there's a debt underwriting opportunity, we're doing the same. So, I think part of what you're seeing in terms of the uplift, and I'd broaden it from just Q3 to this year-to-date period, is we're just using the model better and with increasing frequency across the firm. Second thing I would say is we're utilizing it across more asset classes. Now, if you look at the growth this year, some reasonable portion of it has been by our Capital Markets business partnering with our infrastructure business, which has seen a significant amount of deployment. Q-Park is just one example. There are others. We've had a lot of activity in Japanese buyouts, but both of those areas are new in this year-to-date period. But every year, in terms of your question about the recurring aspects of it, we find that we're able to capture more and more of the economics from our own content by having better penetration of all of our global investment activity across asset classes. So, I think there is. If you go back to that slide 7 of the deck and you look on the right, bottom right how much is KKR in our portfolio companies versus third party, it's about two-thirds, one-third. We have seen a lot of activity with our own companies on that two-thirds piece, and it's the existing portfolio companies plus new deals. And so, it really is not necessarily tied to overall market activity. That piece of it is more tied to our investing activity and what we're doing with the portfolio. The other piece of it is frankly, we're having a significant amount of growth and success in our third-party business where we financed third party, in a lot of cases, sponsors and also corporates and are providing them with advice and capital markets support. And we built out the origination team there and we're having much better penetration in that market as well. So it's not, I wouldn't call it yield, per se, because it's not a contractual yield. Having said that, if you look at the level of activity we tend to have in a year in our underlying companies, our global investment activities, plus all the activity from the third party clients we work with, we find that there's a significant recurring base of fee activity that's been accelerating as we've been using the model more effectively and have our whole firm working together better help scale our own businesses and others.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And just to follow-up, a couple of your peers have been spending more time talking about the opportunity in U.S. retail, particularly in High Net Worth, just sort of citing a lot of under-allocated type of ratios versus the institutional bucket. Can you sort of give us an update? Sort of appreciate the depth and breadth of your model using your balance sheet to leverage both your investments as well as new businesses. Where you sort of stand in terms of maybe global retail opportunity set to further enhance the flow opportunity?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Bill, it's Craig. So, I'd porch a few things. First, we've built a direct effort within the firm and have a team that calls directly an Ultra High Net Worth individuals as well as family offices. The second piece of that would be the work we do with platforms to leverage really the distribution of others. So, whether that's marketing our funds through platforms are also creating unique products again to offer through those platforms, that would be the second piece. The third piece would be what we do through the independent broker dealer network. So, we have, Scott mentioned, our BDC Corporate Capital Trust. That's an asset that's over $4 billion in size, and again, was really created through this channel. And the final part of that we'd almost think of as being kind of R&D. So, I know you have an appreciation, we like whiteboards and we like to think creatively about ways to market our products and ideas through to the mass affluent and we'll keep you updated as that R&D is something that we think is worth talking about on a broader basis. Over time, if you look at the capital that we've raised in that which comes through individuals, it's tended to be somewhere between that 10% to 15% of new capital raised. This quarter was at the higher end of that. It was 14%. So again, it's something that we continue to see in longer term. It's certainly an area that I think you'll look for us to find ways to expand.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The only additional color I'd give you is a lot of those activities are new in the last five to seven years. So, it feels like we're just getting started.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to come back to the strategic partnerships and get your perspective on how many more of these could we actually see form in the immediate term. And also, can you remind us how the performances are calculated and what type of hurdle metric is used, and I assume that's probably different across the different asset classes?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. It's Scott. In terms of how many more, that's really hard to predict. These tend to take one to two years to form and negotiate. And so, it's not a long list of partners globally that can do this because you think about the requirement to commit scale capital across multiple asset classes for a long period of time. It is not going to be an extraordinarily long list, but obviously, when they happen, they can be quite impactful. We just happen to have two get done this quarter, but as Bill mentioned, those two have been in process for quite a while. So, it's more that we wanted to give you the longer term objective we have to grow this effort and find more of these. I'd say also from a servicing standpoint and the amount of time that they take to get done, we will not have 20 or 30 of these, would be my guess. We'll continue to scale the number, but it will take time and it's going to be a bit lumpy. But we have today, more or less three of these, three to four in place today. And they do take a long time to get done. In terms of the specific metrics, they do vary by partnership. We're not going to give you a detail on how the economics work, but suffice it to say, the way we think about it is by doing these, especially at $3 billion or more each, the aggregate economics that we're able to generate for the firm just in the first five to seven-year period is significantly more than what we think we would generate on a status quo partnership basis with that partner. And then, when you think about the ability to then compound recycle capital portion of the profits, then we really have line of sight for a much longer period of time than we normally do with a traditional fund approach. So in a way, we're using this fundraising environment and cycle to raise funds for the next several fund cycles, and that's how we think about it and it's all quite accretive. And it's a win-win for the partner because they're able to actually have some discounted economics. And from our standpoint, we can show some creativity in terms of structuring.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Another one on the strategic partnerships, with the understanding that you only have three or four now, but have you done any work around maybe trying to size how much or what percentage of these would have been AUM that would have come into your pipeline of funds anyway? I mean, what's the incremental AUM you think you're winning on top of what you probably would have already gotten through the normal fundraising cycle?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: That's a great question that I don't know the answer to and it's very hard to be precise. I will say some of these relationships, I would say on average, they're probably three or four times the size that I would have expected, just normal course, without having this kind of broader wrap around strategic partnership approach. That's one way to think about it. So maybe if you have $1 billion to $2 billion partner, you end up over time with a partner that's much bigger than that, especially when you think about the recycling. Some of the capital would go into product areas where we might have been able to raise the capital elsewhere. But I tell you, Patrick, not a huge amount. I'd say a lot of the capital is going to be incremental to what we would have otherwise been able to raise elsewhere. And the real power is, as I've just mentioned, not just the next 5 years, it's the subsequent 25. And the ability to actually make an investment, generate a profit, and then, have more capital to invest that's pre-committed to us is a big deal and a lot different than how we've traditionally raised funds where we have to go back and start over. That piece of it is incredibly powerful. And so, if you look out beyond kind of years five to seven, I'd say, what would have started as a majority of the capital, I would say, would be new to the firm. I'd be confident saying that. Beyond that first fundraising cycle, it's going to go up from there.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And Patrick, just to give a little color, and he's right, you asked a question that's really hard to answer. One of the strategic partnerships that we just closed on this quarter is with a relatively new partner, they'd had only invested a small amount of capital in one particular fund. They were interested in a long relationship with a GP. And so, over the past year plus, we worked on that with that LP and I think that that would be all incremental as opposed to a couple of the other strategics who have been with KKR for a very long time, and that would be harder to try to figure out what that number would be.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Very helpful. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. Maybe I wanted to touch in on infrastructure. Looks like per page 12 of the release, that was a segment that was up quarter-over-quarter. Can you perhaps give us an update as to where the latest fund, vintage fund stands with respect to commitment or percent committed and when potential successor fund might enter the discussion?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. Hey, Gerry. It's Craig. Thanks for the question. I'll answer the first part and I'll have Bill give you an update on the commitment piece. Look, I think the part that you're totally – you're exactly correct about, is the momentum we feel and I think that's true in terms of both the global need for infrastructure. It's enormous, it's growing. The infra team, as they have a sense, from Scott talking about Q-Park as well as Calvin Capital a couple of quarters ago, the infra team, for us, remains one of the most active teams from a deployment standpoint. And I think there are a few things that make us unique in this. One, we're looking for infrastructure with a focus on downside protection. So, we have a pretty disciplined focus on it. We're pleased with the returns we've been delivering for the last decade. And I think we've proven we can navigate complexity. I think there are elements of that you see in terms of the Q-Park transaction and when we're able to look at that opportunity and put that together with the balance sheet and the Capital Markets business, it's pretty compelling. From a performance standpoint, you have a sense of overall performance, you're correct, on page 3. With the infrastructure fund itself up over 20%, the Infra II funds similar performance for Infra I and it's really been strong and it's been broad based. And in terms of the platform, when you look at the two funds we have in the SMAs, we're at almost $6 billion of AUM and we're fundraising forward in infrastructure strategy.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And then, as it relates to the remaining commitment, if you turn to page 15 of the press release, you could see that we've got roughly $1.8 billion of remaining uncalled commitment. However, that being said, and we mentioned this earlier, we've been pretty active in infrastructure, and so, Q-Park actually did close in the fourth quarter. And so, we're probably going to put anywhere between $600 million and $700 million to work in the fourth quarter or the first quarter, depending on the closing of the signed transactions that have not yet closed. And so, we're – obviously, with having that much piece of deployment premarketing this next infrastructure fund.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: Hi, thanks. There's been some talk on the press of some of only the largest funds in thinking about insourcing and going direct on PE, which I'm not a huge fan of, if anyone asks, but how does that play into the whole the client demand that you're seeing, like the New York City deal, in these partnerships. I know we've asked all asked a few different ways on how many are there, but how pervasive is that? Is that conversation on insourcing versus going longer term for preferred terms?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Glenn, it's Scott. I'd say it's not many institutions are able to truly go direct themselves. The staffing requirements, the ability to staff across multiple asset classes and build a global investment team, there are very few institutions in the world that are able to do that. So while I read the same press that you have, in our experience, that is a small minority of institutional investors that are pursuing that strategy. What we're finding to be much more pervasive is that institutions are beginning to act out some of the themes that we've been hearing from them the last few years which is they feel that in the last cycle, they over-diversified their portfolio and they're trying to figure out how to do more with fewer partners. And I think the strategic partnership theme we've been discussing fits right into that. They're just basically acting on that view that they have a lot of capital, a small amount of staff and a desire to partner closely with firms like ours to basically be an extension of their team on a global basis and a long-term structure. We're finding that to be a much more frequent conversation than those trying to go direct.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: That makes a lot of sense to me. And I know you said don't have lots of these and you don't expect 20 or 30 of these but do you have any limitations in your mind in terms of what you'd be willing to take on? I heard you on the triple the economic, so I think more is better. And then, just the follow on, is how do you set the size limitation? In other words, you talked about $3 billion and above. The $1 billion, $2 billion seem like pretty big numbers. So like, how do you draw that line?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. So, I'd say, look, there's no contractual limitation, per se. There is a limitation, vis-à-vis, just our own ability to service and operationalize in a period of time. But I want to be very clear what we're talking about. We're using this term strategic partnerships in a very specific sense. It is basically the partnerships that are quite long term. The ones we're talking about today have long-term recycling provisions that are contractual across multiple asset classes at $3 billion-plus. We have a large number of investors with whom we work that are invested with us across multiple asset classes, that have virtually all of those characteristics, except for the long duration recycling that's recommitted. But we have a lot of partners that work with us in the $1 billion, $2 billion size range across multiple asset classes. It just hasn't been put into this kind of strategic partnership wrapper. And so, if you look at us as a firm across our client base, our average cross-sell is 1.9 products per client, and if you look at our top 50, it's over 4 products per client. And so, I'd say we have synthetically a number of these strategic partnerships already in-house and we're going to continue to grow those, but those just don't happen to have this kind of 20 to 30-year contractual element, although several of them that we find have very, very long lives just by virtue of the underlying partner recommitting to us across multiple strategies. So, we'll look at it broadly, but it's really the specific long-term recycling element that's contractual, is what we're calling out today.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. All right. Thank you very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, good morning, everyone. So shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to touch on the balance sheet. So, the cash balances are up nicely. I think $3.6 billion versus $3 billion last quarter. Can you guys talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the deploying of that cash over the next couple of years? Should we think of that all in terms of co-invest or is there some M&A opportunities that we might be thinking about as well? And then, I guess, bigger picture, just the evolution of the balance sheet period, how should we think about that over the next two to three years? Obviously, with so much of the legacy investments coming down and First Data doing quite well since the offering, so looks like that might be something to think about as well the next 12, 18 months or something like that.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Alex, this is Bill. When you look at where the balance sheet is today, and remember, our strategy is a little different than others, and that we retain a lot of the economics on the earnings and put that back onto our balance sheet to compound that. And so, what you'll end up doing, hopefully, is actually see the balance sheet just continue to grow. From an allocation point of view, we spend a lot of time just trying to figure out where we need to deploy capital. And so, that might be platform-specific or geography-specific. And we give a lot of thought around just trying to make sure we sort it out what that right number is. And so, when you mention co-invest, as you probably recall, certainly over the last couple of years, we've been making significant commitments to our funds and deploying capital that way. But in addition, we have the ability and the way our model works is, first, we have to make sure that we satisfy the flagship funds investment mandate. And then, we have the ability to syndicate or to co-invest. And so, we were opportunistically have the ability to co-invest alongside capital that's being invested by third party investors.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say, look, the second part of your question, the balance sheet makeup, we have an asset allocation model for the balance sheet which we work our way toward and we've made good progress over the last couple of years. We've got, if you look at page 19 in the press release, you can see the contractual funded GP commitments we have which are nearly $3 billion. So, that will get drawn down as those underlying funds get drawn down. We do have some new business ideas that we're working on and that we'll continue to use the balance sheet to see those new businesses on a go-forward basis and we'll keep you updated. Co-invest will be part of it, but we also do have opportunities on the strategic side with respect to what we've already done. So, I mentioned the incremental 5% that we're buying Marshall Wace which will show up in our AUM and our fee-related earnings. And we've got other things that can happen from time to time on the strategic front. We've largely grown ourselves organically the last several years but there may be some things on the opportunistic side that could be interesting in time. But I think you'll continue to see us commit capital across all of our asset classes. And one of the things we're focused on is getting to that asset allocation number. And frankly, kind of 40% to 50% is our target around private equity on the balance sheet. As we'd have a lot of monetizations, we've been working to make sure that we kind of keep in that range.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up, again, around strategic partnerships. As these type of relationships scale for you guys, anything you need to invest into operationally to help service these type of mandates that could kind of augment the FRE margin profile of the business as a whole or the business is generally kind of scaled enough, so that's not a really needle mover in terms of the FRE margins?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Alex, this is Bill. That's a very good question. And Scott mentioned this, and this deals with operational complexity. And so, these strategic partnerships are very customized, and so, you have to deal with fee calculations and carry, et cetera. But when you think about having the ability to raise large sums of capital, like a $3 billion mandate, if we have to add a few people to deal with the compliance, regulatory environment, finance and tax, the economics far outweigh the minor expense in order to service that particular strategic partnership.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess my question, first question here, just the trajectory of FRE obviously significantly higher year-to-date. Some of that's tied to the higher Capital Markets transaction fees which obviously could be lumpy, but it sounds like the outlook commentary there is pretty good. So, I'm just trying to think about it, as you guys are going into 2018 budgeting and kind of reexamining the dividend, with the dividend contemplated off of kind of the trajectory of FRE, how should we think about maybe the capacity for dividend increases relative to the FRE growth when you kind of factor in how strong the Capital Markets piece has been this year?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Devin, this is Bill. When you take a look at fee-related earnings, you are right. And so, if you take a look year-to-date 2017 compared to 2016, we're up 49%. And when you think about what drove that, we raised significant pools of capital for Asia III and America XII which has now come online, and so, you saw a significant increase. And what we try to do is when we try to size the dividend itself into component of both the fee income, net of expenses, as well as the yield. And when you look at the balance sheet, and Scott just talked about this a little bit earlier, from an asset allocation point of view, we're trying to grow our allocation really in private equity which would impact yield. And so, at the end of the year, when we're deciding what the distribution for 2018 would be on a quarterly basis, and we haven't done that math yet, those two things are taken into consideration when we're talking about a distribution for 2018.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And follow-up here, just I think last quarter, you highlighted a second Energy Income and Growth Fund could be coming down the pike. And I'm just curious about kind of aspirations for size there. Would that be multiples of the first fund of $2 billion or just trying to think about kind of the outlook for that area and maybe kind of appetite for exposure there?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hey Devin, it's Craig. So, you're correct, we are fundraising for a follow-on fund in the energy strategy. As you see on page 3, the performance has been strong. As I know you have a sense, we're not big on providing target sizes, et cetera. So no specific comment in terms of your question of whether it could be large, and if so, how much, but we'll look to raise a pool of capital that we think is appropriate on behalf of our LPs to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The only thing I would say is energy fits obviously into our real assets area where we just would tell you that over time with significant amount of growth opportunity broadly across real assets, and energy is part of that. There could be multiple ways to get there but energy is a young business for us that we think has growth opportunity.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay. Figure I'd try there. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Appreciate the attempt.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about data and technology and if you could talk about your investment process today. Basically, how you see that evolving over the next five years, given a lot of changes in technology, growing amounts of data and how you're integrating that today relative to where you'd like to be?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey Michael, it's Scott. Yeah, timely question. So, we've been spending a lot of time working on this and thinking about it. As a reminder, several years ago, five, six years ago now, we had a team join us, our Global Macro and Asset Allocation team led by Henry McVey, and part of the logic for that team joining the firm is we felt that there was a lot of information that we have inside KKR that we could use more effectively to make us better investors. So, a good portion of where that team spent their time is making sure that we're looking at the information we have in-house, and then, they work across all of our different investment committees to make sure that our discussions are informed by the data that we have in the firm as best we can. Having said that, and then, I think that's had a big impact on how we think about investing and how we're deploying capital. But having said that, we think there's a long way to go and a lot more that we can do. And so, we are spending time looking at how do we bring more technology to bear in terms of analyzing the data that we see coming out of our portfolio companies and that we otherwise have access to, and figuring out if there are ways to get a read through from that data that will further enhance our ability to see trends and make good investments. And so, it's an area that we're spending time on. I think it's something that given our globality and the breadth that we have across asset classes, it should provide us with an incremental competitive advantage, and so, we're spending more time there. Bit early to give you a specific update as to how we're going to use technology to get even more out of the data. But I would say we've started, but it's kind of second inning relative to where we, I think, we'll end up.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And just on the balance sheet, I know in the past, you gave some figures around that. Just hoping to get a little bit better understanding on how much capital was deployed off the balance sheet during the quarter, and also, how much was monetized off the balance sheet?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey. Michael, this is Bill. Nothing terribly exciting this quarter. We did mention that there was good monetizations which drove the performance income from the funds, but we had some minor activity off the balance sheet. So for example, I mentioned in prepared remarks that we sold a small portion of our First Data position that was roughly 7% percent of our position and that generated roughly $100 million. But overall, you could see that the balance sheet hasn't gone up or down meaningfully quarter-over-quarter.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Craig Larson for any further remarks.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Daniel, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. If you have any questions, please feel free to follow-up with us directly. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today Mr. Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Nova. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, our newly appointed Co-President and Co-COO. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release and the supplementary presentation which are available on the Investor Center section of kkr.com. And the call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And with that, I'm going to begin on page two of the supplementary deck. This morning we reported strong second quarter results with record after-tax economic net income and record book value per unit. Investment performance was strong and we've continued to have success from a fundraising perspective. In terms of our financial performance, we reported after-tax economic net income of $753 million for the quarter, which translates into $0.89 cents of after-tax ENI per adjusted unit. And over the trailing 12-months we've generated over 2.2 billion of after-tax ENI. After-tax distributable earnings were $322 million for the quarter and we've generated over $1.5 billion of after-tax DE on a trailing 12-month basis. Also of note, as you look at page 2 of the deck, our after-tax ENI and after-tax DE margins for the quarter and trailing 12-months are all attractive, ranging between 49% and 59%. Our fee related earnings have grown meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. Focusing on ENI, we've generated an LTM return on equity of 23%. We're reporting $13.50 of book value per adjusted unit and we've seen book value compound by 19% on a year-over-year basis. And the firm continues to grow nicely with AUM and fee-paying AUM up 13% and 19%, respectively over the last 12 months. And one additional note, within our press release, you'll notice, we've added a new page, page 8 which shows the build up of our after-tax distributable earnings in greater detail relative to what we report historically further enhancing our overall disclosure. As a whole, it was an excellent quarter and I'm pleased to turn the call over to Bill to run through our performance in more detail. Bill?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. We had strong investment performance both on a quarterly and LTM basis across our carry paying funds performance. This performance, which Scott will discuss in more detail contributed to the deposit results we reported this morning. Focusing on our total segment financials. Management, monitoring and transaction fees were $365 million in total up 39% year-over-year. If you turn to slide 3 of the supplement, you could see the growth and diversification of our management fees. Year-over-year management fees are up 13% and the highest we've ever reported. One item to note is Asia III is contributing to management fees for the first time this quarter. The fund entered its investment period on March 31 and has total commitment to $9 billion. As a reminder, on a run rate basis, Asia III will add approximately $15 million (4:11) to net annual management fees. In terms of transaction fees, we reported $156 million of fees this quarter driven by our continued momentum within our Capital Market segment. Page 4 of the supplement profiles the growth of the KCM segment. LTM revenues were up 65% compared to 2016 and year-to-date revenues of $215 million already exceed the $182 million we reported for all of 2016. On the bottom half of the page, you'll see that KCM has been active in all geographies, in debt and equity, and in financing and syndication for KKR lead and third-party investments. Turning to performance income. We reported $564 million, the highest in two years. Several exits drove $265 million of realized carry up 28% compared to the last quarter and the exits were well-diversified between strategic and secondary activity. And on a blended basis, the PE exits were done at 2.6 times our cost. Strong marks (5:24) across the portfolio also contributed favorably to total performance income as unrealized gains of $300 million were more than double last quarter. This has resulted in a 15% increase in unrealized carry on our balance sheet quarter-over-quarter. Investment income came in at $336 million, up nicely quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Strong performance across our private market strategies drove more than $300 million in unrealized gain, the largest figure we reported in over five years. Bringing it all together on a total reportable segment basis, fee related earnings came in at $214 million. Our after-tax distributable earnings were $322 million with after-tax ENI of $753 million. Moving to deployment, we invested $4.9 billion of capital this quarter. Public markets deployed $1.3 billion. This deployment came from investments made across our alternative credit vehicles, primarily within indirect lending. And as you'll recall, we are entitled to economics on our alternative credit vehicles largely on in invested as opposed to committed basis. On the private market side, we invested $3.6 billion. The largest contributors were a Private Equity investment in a specially travel company out of Europe IV and a core Private Equity investment in USI, a leading retail middle market insurance broker. This is an investment that we made through our core Private Equity partnership with Case, which included funds from our balance sheet. Moving to AUM and fee-paying AUM. AUM increased by $11 billion in the quarter, driven by inflows in Asia III, healthcare growth, real estate and our alternative credit funds. We ended the second quarter with fee-paying AUM of $113 billion, which includes $8.5 billion of third-party capital committed to Asia III. On page 3 of the supplement, you can see the increase in fee-paying AUM has, in turn, resulted in management fee growth with fees growing at a 10% CAGR since 2010. And overall, our capital raising activity has resulted in approximately $43 billion of dry powder across the firm as of June 30, an increase from the prior quarter despite a robust level of deployment. One other thing to note on June 1, we completed their strategic transaction to combine PAAMCO and Prisma to create PAAMCO Prisma holdings. The combined business is now one of the largest in the liquid alts industry with more than $30 billion of AUM. Our hedge fund business now includes five strategic partnerships with $77 billion of AUM, of which our pro-rata share is about $24 billion. And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Let me start off by saying that Joe and I are honored to join Henry and George as part of the leadership team to help lead KKR in its next stage of growth and development. Importantly, we take on this responsibility as long time friends with a view that partnership is the key to KKR success. These roles are a natural extension of what Joe and I have already been doing. And our focus remains on making KKR an even more successful firm. So, with that, let me turn to the results. As Craig and Bill discussed, we had a very good quarter. And looking at the last 12 months, we're pleased with the fundamentals we're seeing across our firm and businesses. Our investment returns are strong. Our deployment pace is high and activity broad based. We've monetized the number of investments, we've had good fundraising momentum and we've used our model to capture more of everything that we do. So, let me take each of these in turn. Let's start with performance. Take a look at page 5 of the supplement. We've had strong investment performance across our asset classes. In Private Equity, our portfolio appreciated 12% year-to-date and 19% in the last 12 months. And, if you look more closely at our benchmark Private Equity funds, on a trailing 12 month basis, our North American, Asian and European PE funds shown on the left side of the chart are up 33%, 13% and 22% respectively. In our non-PE strategies, we're also seeing strong investment performance. I realize that strategies are performing with a rebound in our energy income and growth fund in particular. We've also seen strong performance across our alternative credit strategies with our special situations, mezzanine and direct lending funds up 34%, 11% and 15% respectively on a trailing 12 month basis. Our balance sheet investments also had strong performance appreciating 10% year-to-date and 18% in the last 12 months. Now moving on to deployment. We had another active quarter, and over the last 12 months, we deployed about $17 billion across businesses and geographies, compared to $11 billion in 2016. Activity has been broad based by strategy, with $12 billion coming from private markets and $5 billion from public markets. In terms of realizations, Bill already walked you through the details. We're continuing to see strong monetization activity. Looking at the last 12 months, we returned over $13 billion to our private markets investors, driving $1.5 billion of after tax distributable earnings. And on a blended basis, these exits were done at 2.4 times our cost. Let's turn to fundraising and business building. Page 6 highlights the growth in assets over the last 12 months. Fee Paying AUM and AUM were up 19% and 13%, respectively, driven by $25 billion of organic capital raised. Private markets accounted for $15 billion of the capital raise, driven by Americas $12 billion and Asia $3 billion, a $9 billion fund raised in just seven months. The remaining $10 billion of new capital came from public markets, specifically in CLOs, private credit strategies and our strategic partnerships. Shifting to our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet, this was another quarter where the power of our model was evident. Our strong activity level in Capital Markets continued, with almost $94 million in transaction fees in the quarter. And looking at the last 12 months, we've executed 162 transactions, generating about $300 million in fees. This includes 84 third-party transactions. And our third-party capabilities are directly synergistic with our Credit Investing business. We're able to deliver multiple solutions in a single conversation, creating an underwriting opportunity for our Capital Markets business and a new investment opportunity for our Credit business. As we've mentioned before, Capital Markets and the balance sheet do not show up in our AUM, but they are powerful economic contributors for the firm and allow us to move quickly, speak for larger investments, and scale our third-party business while generating fee economics for the firm. We believe capturing more of everything that we do through a model of third-party AUM plus Capital Markets plus balance sheet allows us to increase alignment with our fund investors and drive a highly attractive ROE and a larger quantum of total cash flow. The power of our model is evident in our results. Over the last 12 months, our book value is up 19% and we generated a 23% ROE on an after-tax ENI basis. To bring it all together, our core fundamentals are summarized on page 7. We're pleased with our progress this quarter, and with $43 billion of record dry powder, multiple scaling businesses, and improved utilization of our model, we're looking forward to what's next. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operating Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hi, good morning everybody. And, Scott, congrats to you guys as well. So, wanted to kick off with a question around Capital Markets, obviously a very powerful growth driver for you over the last couple of quarters. Could you guys spend a minute on kind of what the next leg of growth here will be from? And I guess, how are the economics shifting between you guys and just kind of the various members of the syndicate, and how much that's been a helper in kind of the recent growth?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Great, thanks Alex. This is Scott. So, I'd say a few different things are going on. One is, we've been doing a more effective job using the business model of Capital Markets and balance sheet across more parts of the firm. This year in particular, I'd focus you on infrastructure and Asia. Is two areas of the firm where we're starting to do larger transactions where we've been able to underwrite both equity and debt, and syndicate both of those and generate fee economics for the firm. And so I'd say the first leg to the growth has been greater penetration of KKR's businesses and using the model with more frequency and effectiveness around the world. So that's part one. Part two would be around our third-party business, in particular linked with our credit investing platform. So we've spent a lot of time building out origination capabilities across areas like private credit in particular, where we're doing transactions with other financial sponsors and underwriting debt deals for them to help fund their transactions, either new deals or refinancings of existing companies that they own. And so, we've been making progress in terms of penetration there as well. That's sometimes on an underwritten basis and sometimes on a best efforts basis. And so really, what you see showing up in the numbers this year, and the reason for the growth is kind of a combination of both greater penetration of KKR activity plus third-party activity. No real shift, I would say in terms of how the syndicates are functioning, but I would point you to the fact that we are doing far more lead-left transactions this year than ever before and that's also part of the reason that you're seeing the growth in the fee line.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right, makes sense. And then I guess secondly just around the management fees, obviously very robust fundraising environment for you guys over the next couple – over the last couple quarters. I guess what else is on the come as we think about any larger funds coming in over the next 12 to 18 months and how we should think about, I guess about the management fee trajectory from here?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Craig, why don't you take that one?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Alex, thanks for the question. Look, I think, why don't I start with where we're in the market currently and then as we think about over time from a fundraising standpoint. First, in terms of episodic funds, that would include healthcare growth. Two, real estate strategies, REPA II as well as real estate credit opportunities, Lending Partners III and Private Credit Opportunities II. And this is in addition to areas where we look to raise capital at a more continuous basis that includes our leveraged credit strategies, both in the U.S. and Europe. So, that would include high yield and leveraged loan SMAs and CLOs. We actually expect to shortly close on a $700 million CLO actually. Our BDC as well as across our hedge fund partnerships which include Marshall Wace, PAAMCO, Prisma and Afila (18:32). And I think over time, you'll see a third infrastructure fund, a second energy income and growth fund and a fifth European Private Equity fund.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Alex, one other thing to note, Craig was mentioning what the possibilities are on capital that we could raise, but one thing to keep in mind is that as it relates to fee paying AUM, we've raised approximately $12 billion of AUM which hasn't gone online yet. And so, when you take a look of the dry powder that we've got which is shown on page 15, which is roughly about the $42 billion, we've got roughly $6 billion of AUM which will turn into fee paying AUM in private markets and the same holds true on the public markets and that will obviously generate a healthy amount of management fees and the blended rate on that is a little north of 1%.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, I'd say, look, the overall fundraising environment is excellent. The only thing I would add is we continue to see an overall trend toward strategic partnership type activity, larger mandates, multiple asset classes, long term so there is more discussions along those lines happening in the market.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Good morning. Thank you. Could you walk through the underlying kind of revenue and EBITDA growth of the Private Equity portfolio?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Patrick. It's Scott. I'd say overall continuation of the positive trends we discussed the last couple of quarters, so revenue growth 8%, 9% type level, EBITDA growth 10%, 11%. It's continuing to be quite strong, so just think generally speaking high single-digits for both. And I'd say the only underlying trend I'd point you to is, Europe has been – just from an operating fundamental standpoint, very, very strong. So, overall very happy with the portfolio company performance, and particular strength in Europe.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. That's helpful. And then you guys have been one of the more active firms in China over the years and had some very successful investments. Are you seeing any shift in the opportunity and/or in ground (21:05)? Particularly within ground (21:08) JVs given kind of the crackdown on the large conglomerates there and within more wealthy families?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say the big trend we've seen, Patrick is the opportunity for us to start doing larger transactions. There is a significant amount of competition at the lower end for kind of growth deals with relatively small equity checks. We're starting to move to larger sized opportunities in China and that's where we're starting to spend our time with a much greater concerted focus on a going forward basis. The crackdown you mentioned is going to lead to some opportunities, we think over time, but it's generally speaking on the larger end is where we're spending time today.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, good morning. I'm looking at page 12, where you give the balance sheet detail and there are a couple of new big investments that appear in the significant investments section and I wonder, if you could just flush them out a little bit. One is USI and I'm curious on that one whether that's a – I know that's with the Case, but is that also in funds or just on the balance sheet? And is it a strategic investment or is it just an investment, investment? And then also, PortAventura, which I thought was owned in one of your funds, is now on the balance sheet. How did that come about?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the Chris. I'd say first on USI, it is like I guess an investment, investment either way to think about it. We have made the decision to invest some of the balance sheet capital in some longer hold opportunities. It's often referred in the market as core investing. And USI is the first of those investments that we're making. You're right, we did do that transaction in partnership with the Case. And so, that shows up for the first time this quarter on our significant investments table. You should expect that to be a long-term hold. In terms of how we will be accounting for that on the go forward basis, it's going to be equity method, so we will be taking our share of the net income of USI to the earnings of the company that shows up in the balance sheet. So, that will remain on the table I would guess for some period of time. And we're going to be just more broadly speaking about that strategy, we're going to be allocating balance sheet capital to that and we're not raising a fund per se, but we're going to have a couple of separate accounts alongside the balance sheet, so it will be this investment activity plus fee and carry that will coming from those separate accounts. On PortAventura, very perceptive, you're right, we did make a balance sheet investment in PortAventura, an asset we know and like. And alongside a partner and some of our existing limited partners who rolled into the transaction as well. So, that is another large investment that showed up this quarter.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Chris, this is Bill. Just a little color on both. As it relates to USI and Case, we invested $500 million a little off the (24:22) balance sheet, they also invested $500 million. And in that vehicle we are going to be receiving a fee and a carry. No different than a regular fund. But you could look at it really as a Fund of One. And as it relates to PortAventura, although that investment was exited by EIII, we offered the opportunity for our LPs that wanted to roll two role into (24:48) the new investment. We also raised some outside capital, along with the capital that we put in. And for that outside capital, we are receiving regular PE terms with the management fee and a 20% carry. So, good economics on both transactions away from the balance sheet.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just as a follow-up, the – you said you're going to carry USI as equity method. And is that going to show up in fee income or in which segment? Will it be in the principal investments? Where will we see it on the P&L?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Chris, that's a good question. It will probably show up on its own line item, but it will show up in investment income.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. All righty. Thank you.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Are you seeing a lot of competition out there right now for deals? It just seems like the pace of investing is still quite strong and it seems to fly in the face a little bit of what I would imagine to be a pretty competitive environment for transactions. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Chris, it's Scott. Look, there is definitely competition for transactions. Valuations, generally speaking are pretty high. I'd say that if you look at where we're investing capital, it's really in a few places. One is kind of portfolio company add-ons where we're acting more like a strategic buyer. So, a good example of that is earlier this week the Internet Brands acquisition of WebMD was really done through an existing company that we own. So, where we have an angle like that, we find we're able to be competitive by acting like a strategic with synergies. The other thing, in terms of a recent theme you've seen in terms of where we're deploying capital is kind of more late cycle sectors, health and wellness as an example. Both transactions we announced earlier this week kind of fit within that definition. So, we're spending time on themes like that. Our healthcare team is particularly busy right now on the Private Equity front. If you look more broadly at deployment for the firm, infrastructure continues to be incredibly active, U.S. and Europe. And so that is an area where, while there is competition, we are finding some very interesting opportunities with the contracted cash flow dynamic. And our credit areas continue to be deploying a lot of capital into the bank dislocation theme. So, we are deploying capital. But, if you really step back from the Private Equity business and look at it holistically, I wouldn't overreact to the announcements we've been making more recently. We've been selling on a global basis more than we have been buying, in particular in the U.S. and Europe. Asia has been closer to a net deployer, but we see different opportunities there. The only other things I'd mention is we do have a view that now is a good time to be raising capital. We have record dry powder, as we mentioned, a lot of cash on the balance sheet and it is a global market and so we are deploying a lot of capital in places around the world where the valuation dynamics are a bit different than what we're seeing here in the U.S.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And Chris, it's Craig. The one thing I'd add on that is that when people often look at our deployment and ask me about it, there's an assumption or a belief that it is, as Scott had alluded to, it's U.S. Private Equity. And it's interesting anyone you think a) first, recognizing we are a global firm, in the first half when you look at Private Equity, 75% of that was actually invested outside the U.S. into Asia and Europe. And within private markets, Private Equity is 60% of that total. So, when you actually look at those statistics and think of U.S. Private Equity and what percentage that's been in the first half, it's been about 15% of total Private Equity, of private markets capital deployment.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. And Scott, congrats on your promote.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you Craig.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, just starting with the drop in oil prices, that didn't have the same impact on KKR's returns or the ENI results that we're expecting at some of your peers. I'm just wondering, how did you weather this latest volatility in the energy prices better than your competitors?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Craig, this is Bill. We probably brought this up on a call in prior quarters, but when we do our valuations for energy and when you think about energy, about 50% of what we hold is in oil and about 50% is in gas. When you look out over the forward curve and you go three years out, the drop in futures prices from an oil standpoint was less than 2%. And as a matter of fact, on gas it was actually up a little. So when you run a DCF model, you're not going to see much of an impact. Now clearly, if you look at spot, you saw a 10% drop. Also, we've been investing quite strategically in our oil and gas properties over the last couple of years, and we're happy to report that performance has actually been quite robust and that's why, if you take a look, the Energy Income Growth Fund is now actually above cost.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say the only other thing I'd add on, Craig, is, if you look at energy exposure we have as a firm, there's absolutely – the hedge dynamic which Bill mentioned and the forward curve dynamic, but maybe even a bigger impact – because we only have about 3% exposure to energy in Private Equity and a bit less than 3% in credit. So we're underweight energy and then the energy stuff that we do have has been well hedged.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And just a quick follow-up on fundraising. It looks like we should probably expect a pretty big deceleration the second half of this year, really driven by the private market side. And there are a few kind of public market funds, like some of your direct origination, which we expect to raise, but is this sort of in line with your thoughts? And is there any sort of fund that we could be missing?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I don't think there's a fund you're missing. I think you're right in terms of the general trend that, with the Americas 12 and Asia III Private Equity Funds closing at those sizes, we don't have anything that big that's going to be closing in the second half. I think, if you aggregate everything we've got that we're working on, that we still think it will add up to a very attractive number in the second half, if you aggregate all the smaller funds that Craig listed off. But, I think you're right as a general theme, that you'd see less raised in the second half than the first. The only thing that I would say is, I wouldn't overreact to what closes in any one quarter or half. As you know, with the Shadow AUM we have and the capital that's going to be kind of turned on as it's invested, there's a lot of opportunity to grow management fees even with what we have in terms of latent capital already raised. And then the final thing I'd say, as I mentioned before, these strategic partnerships, if one of those gets done, that can move the needle as well.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerald O'Hara of Jefferies.
Gerald E. O’Hara - Jefferies: Great. Thanks guys. You obviously have a sizeable amount of capital here with Asia III, and you talked a little bit about writing larger equity checks in China. But are there perhaps some other themes you might be able to elaborate on as to how you might be looking to deploy some of that capital over the next 12 to 18 months?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Gerald, happy to take a shot. We remain busy, I'd say, across Asia. Japan, India, we announced a transaction in Korea this morning, Australia we've been busy, and those are just a few of the areas that I'd mentioned. We have quite an attractive pipeline of new deals. In terms of themes, deconglomerization would be a big one. We're finding, in particular in Japan, larger corporates looking to sell non-core subs. We've now done several of those transactions in Japan. I think you'll continue to see more corporate carve outs as a theme across the region. Another theme I'd point you to is kind of in the more emerging parts of Asia in particular, we're investing behind food safety, environmental safety, rising middle class, health and wellness, kind of more the growth of the consumer type trends and the growth of these economies. So, we see opportunities on a broad-based fashion across the region, and it's actually in multiple countries. So, we're quite optimistic about our ability to deploy the $9 billion plus fund and generate attractive returns.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And, Jerry, just one other thing to add. Scott mentioned pipeline. As we sit here today, with deals that have been signed and closed or deals which have been signed but have yet to be closed, but if you take a look at what we've got, right now today in the queue, and I'm just talking about the private market side, we're looking to deploy $4 billion over the next two quarters. And when you break that down, that's coming from PE across all three regions. And embedded in that $4 billion is about $900 million in infrastructure alone. And so, as we sit here today, the pipeline looks pretty robust. We can't guarantee that all of those transactions will close, but right now we're pretty happy with the pipeline today.
Gerald E. O’Hara - Jefferies: That's helpful. And maybe one just follow-up for you, Bill, with respect to pipeline as well. In the past you've sort of mentioned or called out some pending closures that could generate future distributable earnings. I'm not sure if that's something you guys are prepared to comment on or could give a little bit of color for us?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Always ready for the question. As it relates to monetizations, and again, where we are today on either transactions that have closed during the first 4 weeks of this quarter, or what's signed and to be closed, the cash earnings for the firm is going to be a little in excess of $200 million.
Gerald E. O’Hara - Jefferies: Okay, helpful. Thanks very much guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys. First one, I guess, Scott, probably for you. But just, given the management announcements, just wanted to get your thoughts on, when the firm and the board is thinking about kind of succession and long term planning, besides those promotions, like what else is the firm focused on? Or what other steps are being taken for the long term, to make sure that the firm continues on the growth path and even accelerates over time?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good question, Michael. Look, I'd say the focus is on our people. We don't make anything, it's all about making sure we've got the right people in the right seats aligned toward the right opportunities in the market. And so, where we spend a significant amount of our time is making sure that we have teams that are aligned against the opportunities we have to scale the firm. And as we've talked about over the last few years, as you know, we have begun a number of businesses at KKR, probably in the last five or six years, where we see a significant amount of opportunity for growth from here both on a organic basis in the U.S. and then kind of an expansion basis around the world and potentially in some instances, strategically as well in terms of things that we can do in the market. So, our focus as a firm is making sure that our people are able to use the model that we've built, that we are working as one firm on a global basis and ideas and relationships travel and that everybody is getting the help that they need to accomplish their objectives and really scale what we've started. If you look at any of the end markets that we're aligned against now, whether it's real estate or credit or infrastructure, we see opportunities to significantly grow these businesses multiples of their current size. And that's really our focus. And the way we do that is by generating investment performance and doing a great job for the people we work for, including ourselves and you. And if we do that, then those businesses will scale in time.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, two of the areas that you guys probably have more history versus some of your peers is both on the Asia side and then in infrastructure. It seems like there's more interest in terms of launching new products in those markets, maybe on the institutional side, allocation of more capital to both of those areas. So, just wanted to get your perspective, given your history, it seems like that's going to be more of a tailwind for you, but you could face more competition. So, just how you're thinking about both of those opportunities over the next few years?
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Why don't I do infrastructure first. Look, I think, we think we are in the early innings of opportunity within infrastructure. There is an estimated 1 trillion to 2 trillion of investment required globally over the next decade to accommodate growth and repair infrastructure, so the capital needs are enormous. And as Scott had said a moment ago, in terms of KKR, we look at it and it remains a big opportunity for us. We established our dedicated infra team, separate from PE in 2008, so you're right, it's for the better part of the last decade it's been a standalone effort of us. And as of June 30, with our two funds in SMAs, we have over $5.5 billion of AUM. And Infra has also been a significant contributor to our syndicated capital figures in Capital Markets, in particular given the size of recent transactions. We talked about Calvin Capital, last quarter and we have some pending investments like Telxius and Q-Park. First fund was $1 billion fund, it's full invested, performed quite well. We are investing the Infra II Fund, younger fund. Investments, again are performing. Second fund was three times the size of the first and not only did the fund triple in size, but the economics did improve from Fund I to Fund II as the carry rate increased. And as you heard from Calvin Capital last quarter, again, activity level there is really high. So, when we look at infrastructure and think about something like Infra III, Infra II at this point is about 70% committed or invested. So, I think over time you'll see us in the market with Infra III. We haven't talked about the potential size, but I know the team feels comfortable that they could certainly manage a larger fund, given the opportunity set as well as the breadth of the team. And Mike, on Asia, look, I think the power you see and the result you saw through Asia III really speaks volumes. We raised the largest fund in the industry in a seven-month timeframe. We have the slide in our quarterly deck that shows the performance we've had across the Asia platform and I think the returns that we deliver on behalf of our LPs have been just exceptional. So, the opportunity set is, one, as we talk about the geographies and the opportunities, Pan Asia, they're all different. The local team that we have and the presence that we have and the longevity that we have in the region and in these local geographies, I think are all differentiators for us.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say, this is probably where the discussions we've had in the past, Mike, on distribution come in. I mean we're building relationships around the world with limited partners across different asset classes and see a significant amount of growth in both of these areas and frankly others. But, if you think about the size of the infrastructure opportunity, it's measured in the trillions, think about the size of the Asian markets and the pace at which they are growing, fact that we've already gone from a $4 billion fund going to $6 billion fund to a $9 billion Fund III, we're going to be doing multiple asset classes in Asia. Real estate credit, you'll see us expand into Asia as well with products over time. So, we see a significant amount of growth opportunity. Yes, there's always competition in what we do, but the size of the opportunity is so massive relative to the pools of capital formed around it, that we're quite optimistic.
Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.
Jack Keeler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Keeler filling in for Bill. First question, I want to circle back to something I think Chris asked earlier and then diving into holding and core Private Equity. Can you first kind of talk about the opportunity you see in separate accounts for core Private Equity? And then second, just as a devil's advocate question, why not raise a core Private Equity Fund? Some of your peers have done that. What leads you to focus to just on separately managed accounts?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the question, Jack. Look, I'd say in terms of the separate accounts, we'll have more to share with you over the next couple of quarters. But, the way I would think about is, you can basically think of it as just a synthetic fund in terms of what it means economically for the firm. The partnerships we're talking about creating will pay us fee and carry economics that will be similar to what you'd see in a fund format. So, I wouldn't get too hung up in the semantics. What we decided to do was to do it in this basis where it's just a couple of partners and a significant amount of our own capital. As we look at the ability to driving value over the long-term, we think having a lot of our money invested alongside a couple of close partners is the right approach for us, for now and we'll see how it evolves in time. But, I think economically for the firm, it's kind of a push relative to raising a fund.
Jack Keeler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, I saw in the press release that the change in carry forward allocation has shifted to 43% from 40%, but there seems like there's some netting against previous management fee refunds. So, Bill, I guess, if you could maybe just walk though some of the moving mechanics there and whether that should have an impact going forward on the P&L?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. You did read the footnote correctly. The punch line is, it's really about geography. The net impact is a push. And so, if you actually take a look at what their performance compensation was for all of 2016, that number was 43%. What we had done when we started reporting publicly, is we used to actually have a separate line item called Management Fee Refund, as well as then a 40% comp load. Those two numbers together, equated to roughly 43%. It was confusing to explain to investors, and so we are just simplifying the process to exclude the Management Fee Refund on newer funds and just go with the 43%. But again, the bottom line is, there is no additional economics being paid to the KKR executives.
Jack Keeler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just curious, if you could elaborate a bit more on the longer duration fund strategy. It sounds like you may be bringing that out in a fund format, but just broadly speaking, how are you thinking about the strategy there? And how many sort of these investments do you think you could do over time?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good question, Mike. I'd say in terms of how we're thinking about it, the second part of the question in terms of how many investments, I'd probably say something in the 8 to 12 type investments range over the next five years or so is a decent way you think about it. It's hard to predict precisely how many and when that will happen. But, we are out looking for these opportunities, and I'd say they largely fall in the bucket of opportunities where the return parameters are a bit lower than what you'd normally see in a traditional Private Equity context. It is broader than Private Equity. It could be infrastructure, it could be real estate as examples, it could be credit. But these would be investments that we see as opportunities to hold for a very long period of time with attractive compounding characteristics. More recurring revenue in nature, not commodity exposed, just far more predictable in their general makeup.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And how do you think about the balance sheet component for this sort of business as you're building it out over the next couple of years? Would you expect the balance sheet to continue to take stakes at all of these particular companies? How do you see that playing out? Because it seems to be moving a little bit different direction than what we have heard on prior calls where you're going to be putting it more in some of your larger Private Equity funds. Is this kind of in that same vein or is this just more stakes in big companies here?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: No. I would say, think of it as a subset. What we've shared in the past is that we kind of think about having our balance sheet asset allocation equity exposure (47:24) over time, is when we see these core type opportunities, we'll also be investing in those alongside a couple of partners. So, I would just think of it as there is going to be the traditional Private Equity funds and then some core investments as well alongside these separate accounts that I mentioned. So, no real difference, just maybe a slight characteristic difference within the Private Equity bucket between shorter term holds and longer term holds.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, great, good morning, guys. And thanks for all the details always. Just a couple quick ones here. So, I guess first, there's been couple of M&A transactions of smaller managers with maybe nichier strategies recently. You guys have obviously done some deals in the past that would add scale with maybe some expense stripping or incremental strategies that you could get into either through acquiring and also just with the contemplation of the stock prices has had a nice move here, so how that may be influences the appetite at all there?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Devin. Look, I'd say in terms of the strategic acquisition potential, I think for the most part we're focused on growing organically. We've got the teams in place, we have the model built. As you can tell over the quarter, like this one and Q1, when the model is working it's incredibly powerful. So, we don't feel a need to go do any strategic acquisitions to add capabilities. We do look, from time-to-time, around some of the newer businesses as to whether there's an add-on that will bring us something that we think we could build ourselves, but it would take longer than we like. But there's nothing that I'd point you to that's imminent. So I'd say for the most part, you should expect us to do things organically, and then if there's anything strategic, it would be more the exception.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, appreciate all the detail on the infrastructure opportunity, and clearly that's been a place that you guys have had a good presence, and some of your peers are following. One area that is not as big for you, I mean the insurance space seems to be an area that firms are going after in different ways and there's a lot of maybe complementary opportunities, just with the types of products and strategies that some of the alternative firms have, that can, I think, really relate with that relationship. So I'm curious like, is this an area that you guys are looking at doing more, if there's a strategy to go after that? Or just not, given all the other opportunities right now to raise and deploy capital, is just not a big priority?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Look, we spend a lot of time investing in the insurance space, and the USI transaction is an insurance brokerage business as an example. I'd say, in terms of capital formation, there's a couple of things I'd point you to. One, we are spending far more time talking to insurance companies and reinsurance companies about investing with us. So we've actually hired some people that are dedicated to spending time in that space, and we're starting to see inflows into areas like credit, as an example, as a result of those investments that we made on the distribution side. In terms of the broader opportunity set to create affiliated companies, we do like the idea of creating permanent capital vehicles that invest with us. We've done that recently with our REIT KREF, which just went public. We have a BDC that we've talked about that's in the process of listing. And obviously with KFN and KPE, a lot of our legacy is around creating entities that can invest in our products. So, we like creative permanent capital ideas; we'll continue to look at it, including in the insurance space, and we'll keep you posted.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay, terrific. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, good morning guys, and congratulations Scott. Just a couple of quick questions, just kind of curious, one, I mean obviously, you've raised a lot of capital in PE and – as have many of your peers who are in the process of it. One of the things – given all the concerns about the ability to deploy, and I know you addressed a bunch of that, but if we get into an environment, let's say, where the wind blows, to use the reinsurance phrase, and maybe asset values start to come down. I mean historically, your PE hasn't really been as much of a distressed or opportunistic strategy. Is that evolving or changing, if you look out ahead in terms of deploying dry powder and if a more difficult environment was to come about?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Look, I'd say – I'd point you to a couple things. One, if valuations come down, it's great to have $43 billion put to work. So, just from a straight Private Equity standpoint alone, we think that that will yield more opportunities for us. And part of the reason that we're pleased to be raising the capital we have been is that we're kind of viewing it as getting ready if there were a valuation dislocation. So, that would be net good news from a deployment standpoint. We also have a distressed business at KKR that (53:05) somewhere between $8 billion and $9 billion in our special situations area that works very closely with our Private Equity teams. So we have those capabilities in-house as well, and if those opportunities turn into more distressed format, or you can take control of a company through the debt, then we're quite equipped to do that, and own several companies that we've taken control of through the debt. And the other thing I would say is, we are making toehold investments in our Private Equity funds. So, from time-to-time, you'll see that we show up as an owner of some public securities on the equity side, also as a way to get exposure to companies that, over time, could become Private Equity opportunities on a more traditional basis. So, I think the way we think about it is, if valuations go down, we have lots of ways to monetize that kind of environment, and we're ready with the dry powder we have.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey Rob, this is Bill. Remember, we've been investing in Private Equity for over 40 years. And when you look back historically, with market dislocations, at those times when we make purchases in a disruptive environment, is where we generate the highest returns.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then maybe one last question just on kind of thinking of capital management and the distribution. I know you've – I believe you've kind of set the dividend level at roughly a level where you feel like it'll take care of any tax liability for unitholders. But, I mean, is there a – could you envision, if you have a year or so where it feels like the tax liability would be higher, that you would pay like kind of a year-end like top up or something to cover it, or should we just think that you pretty much set it at a level you think is appropriate, and that's that?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Rob, this is Bill. Right now, we've set the distribution at a number to really take care of two things. One, we're comfortable in the $0.17, because if you take a look at fee income and cash expenses and then include on that the yielding assets of our balance sheet, that really covers that distribution. And so, from a capital management point of view, we're comfortable with that. In addition, you do point out that, that distribution should cover that tax liability. Based on the numbers that we've run for 2017, we think that the distribution will certainly cover anyone's tax liability. If there was ever an anomaly where that number would spike up, it would be something that we would look at, but I don't know if we would actually change that distribution to react to that accordingly.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. That was it. Thank you for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes. Just a follow-up on the balance sheet. Two things. One is that last quarter there were two investments listed there, an oilfield service investment and a natural gas midstream investment, both around $160 million. They're not there now. Is that just because they dropped out of the top five? Or is it that you divested them? And then secondly, you made the investment in WMIH quite some time ago, now two years. It's my understanding that's just kind of a shell company and is there a time limit on when and how you can deploy that money, that shell?
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Chris, this is Bill. With regard to the first question, those investments are still held by us and actually were up a little this quarter. But, you are right, we are disclosing top five, so because of PortAventura and USI, which we brought up earlier, they dropped off the list.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
William J. Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: As it related to WaMu, that is its own public company and we don't really delve into the particulars around a particular portfolio company. So, that's really not for us to answer.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. This is Kaimon Chung in for Glenn Schorr. I just had a question related to the leadership team. I just want to get some color on the departure of your Head of Americans Private Equity. Maybe some comments on Alex's contribution to the company and maybe your plans for filling that spot?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the question. Look, I'd say on an overarching basis, Alex ran our Americas Private Equity business and that business is performing great. Just to give you one data point, the NAXI Fund has been up 33% in the last 12 months, so he's been a fantastic partner and leader and friend to a bunch of us in the firm for a very long time. Having said that, we do run KKR as one firm where everybody helps each other and so we've got institutionalized processes, sourcing, value creation, overall portfolio monitoring. And as Bill mentioned, we've been in that business for 41 years. So, we've got a really deep bench. 70 dedicated people give or take with 1,100 of us alongside and behind them. So, the place is about more than any one person regardless of who that person is. And so, we've got a lot of great people around that business, a number of partners, leading industry teams. And Henry, George and Joe have been on that investment committee. And Henry and George have been on that investment committee for 41 years and they're not going anywhere. So, Alex has done a great job, but we'll keep unplugging (59:19).
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Nova, thanks for your help, and thank you everybody for joining our call. We look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Nova. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release and our supplementary presentation, both of which are available on the Investor Center section of kkr.com. The call will contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please to refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to the statements. And with that, I'm going to begin on page 2 of the supplement. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, and importantly, these results reflect many of the themes and business drivers that we've been reviewing with you over the last several quarters. In terms of our financial performance, we've had a strong start to the year, reporting after-tax economic net income of $550 million in the quarter, which equates to $0.60 of after-tax ENI per adjusted unit, and over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.7 billion of after-tax ENI. After-tax distributable earnings were $346 million for the quarter, and we've also generated over $1.7 billion of after-tax DE on a trailing 12-month basis. Now, while these results are strong, we actually think the performance of the firm as a whole feels even better. This is a quarter with the power of our model where we look to marry our third-party business together with our capital markets franchise and the balance sheet to generate superior outcomes for our fund investors and the firm was quite evident. And Scott is going to expand on these slots in a few minutes. And finally, we've announced our regular $0.17 per unit distribution for the quarter. And with that, I'm happy to turn it over to Bill to discuss our performance in more detail.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. To set the stage for our results, I will start with our performance. Investment performance for the quarter was solid with depreciation across our private equity, real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit strategies driving the quarter-over-quarter increase in both firm-wide performance and investment income. We reported $349 million of total performance income. Several exits drove over $200 million of realized carry and we also had about $140 million of unrealized carried interest in the quarter. Focusing on realization activity which is highlighted on page 3 of the supplement, monetizations were well diversified between strategic and secondary activity. On a blended basis, the PE exits were down at 3.4 times our cost. Investment income came in at almost $300 million, up nicely quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Performance was broad-based and the balance sheet investment portfolio was up 5% in the quarter. Alternative credit investment performance is worth highlighting as our Special Sits strategy appreciated nicely. Turning to our total segment financials. Management, monitoring and transaction fees were $375 million, up nearly 50% from Q4. Management fees were the highest we've ever reported both on a quarterly and LTM basis. If you look at slide 4 one item of note is Americas XII, the largest Americas-focused private equity fund, which entered its investment period at the end of 2016 and is contributing to management fees for the first time this quarter. The fund held its final close in March, reaching $13.9 billion in total commitment and its $12.5 billion hard cap of third-party capital. We also held the initial close of $5.8 billion from Asia III including $5.3 billion of third-party capital. The fund, which positively impacts prepaying AUM as of March 31, will contribute to management fees in the second quarter. Assuming we reach our $8.5 billion third-party hard cap, which we're very confident we'll hit later this summer, Asia III will add over $50 million to net annual management fees on a run rate basis. Inclusive of balance sheet employee capital, we expect Asia III to be about $9.25 billion upon its final close. As a reminder, now that Asia II has switched to the post-investment period, we'll receive management fees based upon remaining costs. You'll see on the right-hand side of slide 4, we expect a meaningful net management fee pickup with Asia III now in the investment period. Turning to transaction fee, the $243 million we reported were anchored by a record quarter for our capital market segment. Activity here was exceptional to start the year as the team was extremely active offering financing and syndication solutions across our portfolio and third-party clients. Scott will touch on this in more detail shortly. Bringing it all together, on a total reportable segment basis, fee-related earnings came in at $222 million, our after-tax ENI was $550 million, with after-tax distributable earnings at $346 million. Let's move to deployment. As you can see on page 5 of the supplement, we invested nearly $5.4 billion of capital this quarter across both private and public markets. Activity was broad-based by strategy with about 65% coming from private equity. In private equity, we were most active in Asia when we deployed approximately $1.9 billion. One of the most significant investments was in Bharti, India's largest telecom tower operator, which we previously owned. We are also pleased to have closed on two Japanese investments, Calsonic and Hitachi Koki, both of which fit to corporate carve-out theme we've discussed historically on these calls. Given of all of this activity, our Asian Fund II is now fully deployed, allowing for a modest reserve. North America PE represents only 17% of capital deployed in the quarter, driven by our acquisition of a cyber-security service provider. And in Europe, we closed on Airbus Defence Electronics, an investment we announced in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, our PE funds are regional, not global. Given our recent fund-raising efforts and assume we reach the Asian III hard cap, our global PE buying power now stands at $27 billion across our most recent benchmark funds. We were also active across our real asset strategies as well, deploying nearly $1 billion with most coming from Calvin Capital in our Infra II fund and Silverthorne, an investment in producing oil and gas assets in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas out of our energy income and growth fund. We also remained busy on the public market side, deploying about $900 million primarily across Direct Lending and Special Sits opportunities. Finally, turning to AUM and fee-paying AUM, page 6 of the supplement highlights the growth in asset in the last 12 months. AUM and fee-paying AUM were up 9% and 14% respectively, driven by over $26 billion of organic capital raise. These inflows have resulted in record fee-paying AUM of $107 billion and have contributed to $41 billion of dry powder as of March 31, an increase from the prior quarter despite a significant level of deployment to start the year. Our growth profile has been significant since 2010 as highlighted on the bottom-half of the page. In this period, we've more than doubled our AUM and fee-paying AUM with our newer, non-PE strategies largely responsible for that increase. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We've highlighted for a number of quarters five things we need to do well. Bill walked you through the first four: generate investment performance, raise capital, find compelling investment opportunities, and monetize our existing investments. These four are critical components of our long-term success and we continue to feel very good about our progress on each. Today, I'm going to focus on the fifth thing we need to do well, use our model of AUM, capital markets and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our fund investors and the firm from all of our activities. This was a quarter where the power of our model was particularly evident. In private markets, the balance sheet in our capital markets business were critical in winning a number of transactions, in some cases, allowing us to speak for entire transactions, both debt and equity. And in alternative credit, our model allowed us to speak for large originated transactions where we see attractive investment opportunities today. The power of the model working can best be seen this quarter through the results in our capital markets segment. In the quarter, we generated over $120 million in transaction fees, the highest figure we've ever recorded and roughly two-thirds of our revenues for all of 2016. And we remain active in the second quarter. Capital markets hit on all cylinders in Q1. We were active in all geographies, in debt and equity, in private equity and outside of private equity. And we are active in financing and syndications for KKR-led investments and third parties. Let me run through a couple of transactions from the quarter that highlight our business model at work and hopefully make this more real. Late last year, our infrastructure team became enthusiastic about Calvin Capital, a leading UK-based smart meter asset provider. We like the company because of its high recurring revenue, visible growth opportunity from recent regulatory changes and attractive financial profile. As we were working through the transaction key questions surrounded deal strategy and tactics. Size was also a consideration as the acquisition required more equity than we wanted to invest from our Infrastructure II fund. We knew we needed to move fast to invest exclusively without competing proposals. And we needed to speak for the entire transaction to do that. Ultimately, given our conviction, our balance sheet and our infrastructure and capital markets insights and relationships, we committed to the entire £750 million transaction, debt and equity. By doing so, we presented a fast, certain and compelling solution for the seller, and created proprietary opportunity for our firm and our fund investors. After announcement of the deal, we were approached by potential partners and we turned them down, preferring instead to control the situation and syndicate what we couldn't keep to our LPs and third parties. As the transaction closed in Q1, we ultimately syndicated more than 50% of the equity, and we led the debt arrangement. In effect, our model allowed us to move quickly, win the transaction, supply an attractive co-investment opportunity to our partners and create incremental economics for the firm in the process. We're using this approach with increasing frequency across all our businesses and in the U.S., Europe and Asia, allowing us to create attractive investment opportunities and scale our businesses more quickly. We also use the model in the work we do for third parties. We completed 24 third-party capital markets transactions in Q1 alone. Formula One is a noteworthy example. By thinking creatively and leveraging our relationships, we sole led a broadly syndicated $3.1 billion term loan refinancing for Formula One, which was acquired by Liberty Media earlier this year. We extended the maturity profile of the capital structure, reduced interest expense and broadened the lender group by over 20% in an oversubscribed transaction on behalf of a very sophisticated clients. Case studies like Calvin Capital and Formula One are fun to walk through, because they bring to life what we do every day. We have several stories like these. This is important because our model gives us competitive advantages and the ability to earn greater economics relative to a fund-only approach. It allows us to create new businesses quickly using balance sheet capital. It allows us to scale those businesses rapidly by using our balance sheet and syndication capabilities to win attractive investment opportunities and act like a much larger player in the market. It allows us to supply co-investment opportunities for our LPs, helping to expand our LP base and increasing their exposure to our teams. It allows us to do deals with less reliance on financing markets. We can move when others cannot. And it allows us to do all these while creating high margin fee revenues for the firm which are increasingly global and driven by us and third parties. It is this model combined with our culture that allows us to do very creative work and monetized our ideas in a significant way. Remember, KCM and the balance sheet do not show up in our AUM. They do, however, generate significant economics for the firm, both directly and indirectly by allowing us to lean into opportunities we like. As a result, AUM alone significantly understates the earnings power of the firm. Take a look at page 7 of the deck which brings it all together. Critically, we had strong investment performance to start the year. But the model is the real story of Q1. We're using it with increasing frequency and effectiveness. That's great news for all of us shareholders and bodes well for our future earnings power. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And, Nova, just before we begin, I'd like to say it looks like we do have a lot of people in the queue, so if we could please ask people to ask one question and a follow-up, that would be great.
Operator: Thank you. And if you would please limit your questions to one. And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn, your line is open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks very much. I like the big list of pending transactions on slide 3. In the past, you've helped us kind of frame it in terms of potential DE. I wonder if you could do that.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Glenn. This is Bill. How are you?
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hey, Bill.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. When you take a look, there are some small, some large investments in that category pending. And back of the envelope, that will produce roughly about $250 million of cash earnings, either in the second quarter or the third quarter. There's a couple of investments here that might actually slip to the third.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. Cool. And then, just a bigger one is I want to get your perspective on what's going on in retail land in terms of both direct exposure to retail and retail malls related to commercial real estate and then more how you're thinking about that as an opportunity to pull some of that dry powder?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Glenn, it's Scott. Well, I guess, first, let me answer the question on exposure. So if you look across our different larger pools of capital, private equity we have about 8% of the portfolio in retail to broadly define retail and credit, it's about 6%. And on the whole, we're underweight relative to the indices. And I think if you look under the hood of the different types of exposures we have, you'll see a lot of what we're doing is in the value-oriented space. As you know, we kind of did Dollar General several years ago. We're now out of that investment but have made other investments in this value-oriented part of the retail space which we continue to like. So, we are spending time. We do see it as a potential opportunity in different parts of the firm's investment activities, but I think you'll probably see it more in the value-oriented side. And in real estate, we have some exposure to retail but we think we've created attractive valuations and are upbeat about the return opportunity. So, we actually see it as a net opportunity and we're underexposed today.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier, BOA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, sir.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks, guys. Maybe just a question on deployment, just given the robust pace that you guys saw in the first quarter. I just wanted to get a sense, Scott, you kind of went through some of the opportunities that you're seeing, but how are you thinking about like the multiples that you're putting the capital to work in the return profile for these investments going forward?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. Happy to take that, Mike. So, if you sit back for a second, the deployment in the first quarter was $5.4 billion and it's all detailed on page 5 of the slide deck. If you really break that into its component parts, you see about $900 million of that was in alternative credit. About $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion, give or take was in private equity. And then, if you look within private equity, you'd see almost $2 billion of that $3.5 billion was in Asia. And so the story has really been for us a meaningful tick up in Asia deployment with a particular focus on corporate carve out transactions in Japan. And if you look more broadly and say where are we net buyers versus net sellers? In Asia, we're net buyers in private equity. In Europe and the U.S., we've been net sellers. In terms of your question about multiples, it really varies across the different markets. I would say a lot of the transactions that we're doing in Asia where we've seen a lot more deployment as of late had been in the 7 to 9 times EBITDA range with very low cost financing. So, we think we're actually creating very attractive capital structures and attractive post-financing cash flow for ourselves in these carve-outs. And if you look at the U.S. opportunities, it's really going to run the gamut depending on the growth. But we are late cycle. So, you see that we're net sellers U.S. and Europe. But we are finding some niche idiosyncratic opportunities where our industry expertise and operational expertise, we think, give us good line of sight to significant value creation despite where we are in the cycle.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And, Mike, this is Bill. Just to add a little color around pipeline when you think about what we've got in the Q, second quarter, third quarter, back in the envelope, the total capital that we were looking to deploy it on signed transactions that haven't closed in private markets alone, so I'm not talking about public markets, is roughly about $3 billion. And to Scott's point, roughly only about $700 million of that $3 billion is going to be invested in North America PE. The good news in the second and third quarter, like we're showing on slide 5, like in the first quarter is it's broad-based. We have signed commitments for roughly about $600 million in Europe, $750 million plus in PE Asia. We also have a couple of hundred million signed in energy, a few hundred million in infrastructure, a couple of hundred million in real estate. So, when you look across all the platforms are deploying a good amount of capital in the first quarter, and that trend will continue in the second and third.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. Just on the returns that you guys generated this quarter and even over the last couple, we've definitely seen improvement like year-over-year. And just trying to get a sense, when you look across the portfolio of companies, what's the key driver that you're seeing? Meaning, are you seeing better revenue trends, EBITDA improving? Just any color on that, because we're seeing it kind of throughout the industry but what we see on the headlines out there, it's relatively mixed when you look at the macro backdrop.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Great question, Mike. I think what we continue to see is the value creation being driven by improved operating fundamentals in the portfolio of companies themselves. So, if you look at our private equity portfolio broadly, last 12 months, high single-digit revenue growth, high single-digit EBITDA growth, which translates given the capital structures into meaningful net income growth, well ahead of what you'd see in the public markets. And so, that trend continues. And we're seeing attractive growth U.S., Europe and Asia with particularly strong operating fundamentals in Europe over the last 12 months. So, it's really driven by making the companies better post investment and the growth in the portfolio themselves as opposed to multiple expansion or anything else.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on the transaction fee strength. Appreciate the examples that you gave that helped this quarter. Also appreciate they can be lumpy. But it does sound like positive momentum is continuing there. And so, I'm just curious is it normal to see a spike up in kind of some of the activity there just after capital markets have been locked up so maybe there are some pent-up type of business that's working its way through, or is there something else kind of internal where you're maybe putting more of an emphasis on pushing stuff through that channel? Obviously, you mentioned the economics are very good there. So, I'm just curious just given how strong it was could you be a little more granular.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Devin. It's Scott. I'm happy to get more granular. There's nothing that I'd point to in terms of pent-up opportunity or anything with respect to the response to the capital markets which have been open the last, I think, several quarters. It's really, I think, a few different things. One is, as you can see on slide 5, we had pretty broad-based deployment around the world and across our businesses in the quarter. And that's the first thing is a lot of the capital markets business, 70%, 80% typically is going to be driven by KKR-led investments. So, we were particularly active in the quarter, and that's kind of contributing factor number one. Contributing factor number two is we're using the model better. And I think we're using the model more consistently. So, a lot of the drivers this quarter for example, were on the infrastructure side. Which would not have been the case a couple of years ago. It was quite broad based across the different businesses that were using balance sheet and capital markets more consistently. The third-party business especially around our credit franchise, where we're speaking for larger debt transactions, holding what we want and syndicating the rest, that model is working quite effectively today and I'd say more effectively than even a couple quarters ago. So, that would be the second contributing factor. And the third contributing factor is really what's happening in Asia. Our private equity business in Asia over the last several years has been heavier on the minority growth investment side, where there's less opportunity frankly to use the entire model and machine. And what we're seeing more recently is more control buyout transactions especially as I referenced in Japan, we're really able to use the whole model. And if you look in the first quarter between Calsonic and Hitachi Koki, those transactions were ones where we're able to use balance sheet, capital markets, speak for significant portions of capital and syndicate them. And so, the expansion and evolution of the Asia private equity business would be the third piece of the evolution I'd point you to.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And, Devin, just to give you more color around the transaction piece in the capital markets business, when you slice through the numbers, roughly about 55% of that revenue came from outside the United States. And equally as important, about 20% of that revenue was generated from our third-party business.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Terrific. That's great color. Appreciate it. Quick follow-up here. Just on the balance sheet just given how strong the performance was there, can you give us a little bit more background on some of the drivers this quarter?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Devin, this is Bill again. The punch line is that it was a good quarter on every single platform that we manage. And so, when you look at the assets, private equity was up. Real estate was up nicely. Infrastructure was up. On the alternative credit side, I mentioned earlier in prepared remarks, we had a very nice quarter on the balance sheet in Special Sits. And so, it's great when things are working.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay. Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I recognize it's still pretty early, but I was wondering if you guys could comment on the new administration's proposed tax reform with the 15% corporate level and, obviously, 15% on pass-through income, what it sort of could potentially mean for your thinking about a potential conversion to C corp? Again, I understand not a whole a lot of details, but just high level. Was wondering if you could provide some color.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Alex. This is Bill. The only thing I could tell you is stay tuned. We're doing the same thing you're doing. We are watching what's going on down in Washington as these proposals or potential proposals come up. We certainly analyze every single one. But until we get more concrete information, there's really nothing to comment on.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Fair enough. And I guess when I think about the balance sheet strategy, I guess just extrapolating from some of the numbers given the 5 or so percent mark, it looks like the co-invest from your guys' side was somewhere in the $400 million to $500 million, which I guess is a high-single-digit rate given the $5 billion plus of total deployed capital. Is that ultimately still kind of the right way to think about how much of the ultimate co-invest you guys are willing to do over the longer-term basis? Obviously, I understand it could vary quarter-to-quarter, but kind of high-single digit of total capital deployment is kind of how we should think about it?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: You're talking about co-investment in private equity specifically?
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just I guess across the balance sheet strategy. All right. So, like if you look at the total investments and see the growth quarter-over-quarter backing out the performance. It looks like it was about 7% or so of the total $5 billion that you deployed.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Look, it's a good question. I think it's going to be hard to get entirely precise on that because it depends by business to some extent. So, for example, the Americas private equity business, as you know, we've made a billion-dollar commitment to what is a nearly $14 billion fund, so that would be pro rata. We might do some co-invest alongside the fund commitment. Asia, we've made a $500-million commitment off the balance sheet to fund. That's going to be about $9.25 billion, we believe. So, it's really going to depend on the mix of what strategies we're investing in an individual quarter. Alex, but I'd say for the most part in our more mature businesses, we're in this kind of 5% to 10% GP commitment range in terms of the fund investment. For some of the newer businesses, it's higher because as you know we seed those strategies. And then on top of that to make the math very hard for you to do in terms of modeling quarter to quarter, we from time to time do co-investments alongside those deals and alongside those funds, and then we may seed new strategies from time to time. So, it's going to be hard to give you a specific formula. I'd say that 7% when you put all that and mix together, it's not out of the ordinary. But I can't tell you it's going to look like that every quarter.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. All right. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citi Group. Your line is open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just short of wondering on the back of the strong growth in both America 12% and Asia 3%, and you look forward over the next 6 to 12 months, where do you see the greatest opportunity to generate incremental fee-paying AUM?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Bill, it's Scott. Look, I think we have a lot of different strategies and funds in the market. So, we got to finish the loop on Asia III and finish the fund-raising there over the course of the next few months. In real estate, I'd point you to, because we've got both our global opportunistic equity funds in the market and we're raising capital for our credit strategies within real estate. So, that's another area where we see opportunities. Our healthcare growth fund is still in the market, so new opportunities there. And then on the public market side, we've got our private credit opportunistic fund which is our successor to our mezz fund. Our third direct lending fund is in the market. And then over time, you'll see a third infrastructure fund and ultimately you're a private equity. So, a lot of line of sight on the more episodic fund front. And then we've got good flows on CLOs, leverage loans, high yield and the our hedge fund efforts have also been bringing capital. So, I'd say it's pretty broad based in terms of where you're going to see more scale. It's in more of those episodic funds, which as you know tend to have more of these lumpy closes. The other trend I would point you to is we continue to find that larger institutional investors are interested in consolidating their relationships. So, they want to do more investing with fewer firms like ours. And so this trend, we've discussed in the past to strategic partnerships, which can be long term and large scale continues. And I think that's another thing that I think we'll keep you posted on. But there's increasing conversations on that front.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And as a follow-up, I supposed you're going to take my next question. I guess there's been some news back and forth with some bigger LPs around pricing. Its seems the amount of money you're raising, there may not be an issue at the margin. But can you talk a little bit about how the economics, if at all, are changing in terms of some incremental growth that's coming in the door?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, sure. Look, I think there's lots of puts and takes in these kinds of discussions, but just take the recent private equity funds as an example. The economics are at least as good, if not better in aggregate and the fund sizes are bigger. So, there's absolutely the case that there is discussions with investors about value for service. But we sounded if you keep your returns high, there's an opportunity to kind of the keep the terms in place for the most part. And frankly, we will if someone wants to give us large size or long-term visibility on capital. We'll consider reducing economics but it's in the service of a better revenue picture overall.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. How should we think about the phase of remaining $290 million of share repurchase authorization?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Craig. This is Bill Janetschek. As we have mentioned on the last couple of calls, we're mindful of our share count as far as compensating people who will issue shares on a pretty regular basis, and we'll use that buyback to make sure that that we do not have share creep. We didn't use the buyback plan this particular quarter technically. But if you might have seen the press release, we ended up cancelling about 1.9 million shares after quarter end and we used about $35 million of cash off the balance sheet to retire those shares.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then can you update us on your appetite for C corp conversion and what changes are you looking for in terms of changes on the tax front that would make that option more attractive for you guys?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: As we mentioned on a couple of calls, we were mindful of what's going on in Washington. We'll be excited to see if there is any tax legislation that is passed. And based upon what comes out of Washington to the extent that it might make economic sense, we're always open-minded as to what we might do with our corporate structure.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Nova, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Company.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Looking at your 2006 fund, there's still almost $10 billion of remaining fair value there, and the fund is now 11 years old, And we understand that all the, like, pre-crisis funds have kind of an extended life cycle. And there are obviously some big chunky positions in that. And I wonder, can you remind us exactly how patient can you be in realizing those remaining investments before you have to jump through hoops with your investors in that? And, I mean, do you have a couple of years left so that you can really manage for realizing full value there?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Chris. This is Bill. You are right. The 2006 fund, we started investing in 2006. We went into the post-investment period in 2012. Typically, from that end of the fund life, we usually try to monetize those investments over the next five to seven years. So, just doing broad math, you should see some monetization certainly from that fund because they are a mature assets over the next few years.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. But I think the short answer, Chris, is we don't have a gun to our head in terms of anything forcing us to create outcomes in terms of exits. And we still see value creation opportunities in a number of those investments, which is why we still own them. I think if you look at our portfolio overall, 35% or so of our private equity fair market values over 5 years sold, 33% of its marked it over 2 times cost and almost 50% over 1.5 times cost. So, we still see the upside in those investment. But some of them are more mature. And you'll continue to see exits. So, we see a nice runway to continue to create exits.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. But just to clarify, the clock starts running as it were at the end date of the fund rather than when the investment was made?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Chris, every fund is different. And so some are 12 years from when the first investment was made. Some funds are eight years after the last investment was made. I don't know the exact particulars around the 2006 fund. But to Scott's point, we have a lot of flexibility as to when we need to monetize those investments.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The extension if we were to, Chris, ever end up in a situation where we're nearing the end of a partnership life, it can be extended at our option. I think it may work.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: So, there's no – 41 years in, we've never had to monetize anything ahead of when we thought it was appropriate.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey. Thanks, guys. Scott, you kind of touched on this in one of the first questions, I think. But as we think broadly about how active you and some of your competitors have been as we continue to reach new market highs. I think the bad memories from some of the deals before the last time markets were reaching new high has kind of come back. Could you kind of compare and contrast the deals you're doing at these market peaks versus those you were doing in 2006 and 2007? And in that vein, what gives you personally comfort that you aren't making some of the same mistakes?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: It's a great question. Well, Patrick, I'd say – I'd point you to a couple of different things in terms of what's different. One, the multiples that we are paying for assets as an industry have crept up. But if you look at what we're doing as a firm around the world, it's lower now than it was before the crisis, the 2006-2007 type of timeframe. If you look at the multiples, they're higher than what we're doing on the average now, would be the first thing I would say. The second thing is the leverage is lower. And so, leverage in transaction has crept up quite meaningfully. Pre-crisis, we're seeing transaction overall, debt to EBITDA lower than we had at that time, so less financial risk than at that time. The other thing I would say is the mix geographically, entirely different. A lot of those larger transactions were U.S.-based, some Europe. As I mentioned, most of our deployment as of late is coming out of Asia. Newer market for us, lower multiples, different macroeconomic considerations, opportunities for global growth. So, significantly different there as well. And then, the last thing I'd say is I think we've all learned lessons from going through the crisis, and so we've been monetizing investments. And as I mentioned, it's important to look at the net, not the gross. We've been net sellers in the U.S. and Europe and monetizing through strategic sales, IPOs, secondaries, dividend recaps and taking chips off the table at this part of the market cycle. So, I think we are quite cautious about investing in this market in private equity in the U.S. and Europe in particular, but we are finding some opportunities we like, but there's been more selling than buying. And then I think the other thing to look at is the firm overall. We're an entirely different firm now than we were in 2006. We did not have an alternative credit business. We didn't have energy income and growth. We didn't have infrastructure. We didn't have real estate. We didn't have a balance sheet. We didn't have a capital markets business. It's a very, very different enterprise than what we were then. So, I think we've learned in terms of private equity in particular, but the models evolve significantly as well.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. That's helpful. And then there's some news on the tape that's stealing a bit of your thunder. Just curious to what extent you guys have had interactions with ValueAct and if you have any sense of how passive or active they intend to be.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: We have had interactions with them, and they've been great. We like having smart, long-term investors as shareholders. We welcome ValueAct ownership in our stock and on their partnership. We've had discussions. I think they understand and share the vision we have for the business of the firm. And so it's been a good set of interactions so far, and quite positive in a shared perspective on where we can go.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Lee of KBW.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. I'm just curious, I mean – and this is the same thing last quarter. The cash balances on the balance sheet are certainly significantly higher than they were just a year ago. And then obviously, you've had some realizations and maybe some debt offerings in there. But can you maybe talk to us a little bit with your thoughts around your balance sheet liquidity? How purposeful is it that you're trying to build cash balances maybe in an attempt to be more opportunistic should the opportunity arise? I'm just trying to get a little bit more color on your thoughts around that.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Rob. This is Bill. You are right. When you take a look at the cash balance, it's pretty much in line with where we closed at the end of the year. I would say it's slightly more elevated than the cash balance we want to run our business at. But you can't look at this quarter to quarter. Things come in episodically, and so, we continue to have fortunately some monetizations, which are putting that cash on the balance sheet. The one thing to note is that, and Scott mentioned this earlier, we are making large-size commitments now to our funds. So, we committed $1 billion to Americas XII. We just committed $500 million to Asia III. So, we're sitting right now with total commitments of roughly $3 billion-plus, and we're going to need to fund that. Now, that won't have to happen over the next year, but we're cautious with deploying capital and knowing that we have some significant commitments, we're comfortable where cash is right now for the time being.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, I'm just curious, I mean, I know real estate has been an area of focus, but I guess the U.S., the real estate Americas Fund is I think this month reaching at the end of its investment period, it's only kind of about half deployed. So, I'm assuming you have the ability to extend the investment period or is that capital that at this point you kind of shut that down or return it? I mean, how should we think of that?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Rob, you are right technically that we've got a halfway decent amount of uncalled capital. But when you take a look at the table on page 13, it was $1.2 billion fund. We've actually deployed about $900 million. The one reason why that unused commitment number doesn't equal is that we have the ability to recycle. So, when you're looking at this, we do have the ability if we wanted to to deploy another $600 million. You are right that, technically, the investment period ends at the end of May. But keep in mind, a lot of the real estate positions that we have where we make a commitment and then we build up that strategy over the next couple of years. So, regardless of this number, we're still going to need a halfway decent amount of reserve capital in order to make sure we don't have a cross fund issue when we actually close real estate too.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks, guys. A question on your management fees. The $208 million that you reported this quarter, how much of Americas XII and Asia III are in there? And then, I guess, maybe a better question would be how much more incremental do you expect on that $208 million once you're fully taking in those two funds?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: All right. Well, to break it down, let's talk about Americas XII first. Americas XII management fee is in that first quarter because we had a closing on that fund and that fund went live on January 1. So, we have a full quarter of management fees in that number. As it relates to Asia III, we did have a first close on March 31, and $5.3 billion of that capital is now subject to a management fee. And so, you're not going to see that in the first quarter. You'll see that uplift in the second quarter. If you'll turn to the supplement on page 4, it will give you a little bit of guidance. On the far right, we have the Asian II only and what that fee would be. Now, Asia II going from the investment to the post-investment period and Asia III coming online. And assuming we hit that $8.5 billion hard cap, which we're quite comfortable we're going to do, you're going to see an increase in management fees from Asia II and III of roughly about another $55 million. So, you'll see that, long-winded way of me telling you Asia III in the second quarter.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. So, you could potentially see all that of incremental in Q2 is what you're saying.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: It could be possible if we have a final close on Asia III by June 30, yes. If not, then it will peak in the third quarter.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: If not, it's the $5.3 billion divided by the $8.5 billion hard cap, times that number.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious how you're thinking about M&A at the management company. If you could update us on your thoughts there. You did the Marshall Wace transaction maybe about a year ago, something like that. Just maybe your thoughts on how that's been progressing relative to your expectations and what could make sense next for KKR?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Michael. So, a couple of things. First on the Marshall Wace part of the question. The partnership is off to an excellent start. Assets are up 50% since we announced the partnership and we've found lots of ways to work together and create value across both organizations. So I'd say, fantastic partnership thus far and ahead of expectations. In terms of M&A at the management company, I'd just tell you that our ambitions are limited. We are not focused necessarily on M&A as a growth tool. We see a lot of opportunity to grow organically. We'll look from time to time at opportunities across some of our newer businesses, so I think maybe infrastructure, real estate, and we'll look in different markets around the world where we're newer entrant. But for the most part, we've determined that growing organically is a more attractive approach for us. We will consider in these opportunities from time to time. In the hedge fund space, I would tell you that Marshall Wace is likely our swan song at least for the time being. We really enjoy that partnership. We're looking to build in hedge fund through Marshall Wace, and the partnership that we now have with PAAMCO and Prisma, which are the two largest components of our hedge fund strategy along with Nephila and BlackGold rounding it out. So, our hedge fund approach is going to be through these partnerships, which is we're done off the balance sheet so, it's kind of an extension of the firm.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question, maybe you can talk a little bit about the retail distribution build-out, high net worth clients. Maybe you can remind us where that stands today and just how the progress has been in terms of building that out and what's next on that front?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Great question. So look, we continue to focus in this space in a couple of different fronts. So, I think as we've discussed in the past, we've built a direct high net worth effort inside the firm, which is just part one. Part two is the work we do with platforms and so we have a number of relationships where we're marketing through wirehouse and other platforms around the world several of our products. Part three is that we spent time in independent broker dealer channel, have a partnership in particular in credit, where we've created our BDC, which is in now in excess of $4 billion and have a second one in the market. And so, those are really the main three ways that we've been building. We have also created other partnerships. Some of those I put more on the R&D front to try to find different ways to package what we do for the retail investor and the mass affluent. To date, those efforts have borne quite a bit of fruit. Depending on the period you're looking at, they're anywhere from, call it, 10% to 15% of the capital we raised to in some periods upwards of 20%. And we've been raising last 12 months $27 billion give or take. So, the last 12 months has been 10% to 15% range. So, it's been $3 billion-plus give or take of our assets raised have been from that space. And if you look back five years ago, that was virtually zero. And so, we see a significant amount of opportunity to grow from here through all those different efforts and more that we're working on.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, Vince. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We first like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section of our website. This call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance, and please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. Finally, like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning we reported fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. Of note, we reported fourth quarter and full-year after-tax economic net income of $339 million and $576 million, which equates to $0.40 and $0.68 of after-tax ENI per unit. We did healthy level of monetization activity in Q4 and for the full year. Realized carry in Q4 is the second highest quarter we've had as a public company, and realized carry in 2016 was a record for us, contributing to total after-tax distributable earnings of $390 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. Turning to fund raising, we continue to have success with record organic capital raised over the year, and fee-paying AUM at the highest it's ever been, resulting in direct line of sight to future management fee and FRE growth. We've again announced our regular $0.16 per unit distribution for the fourth quarter, and are pleased to announce an increase in our planned quarterly distribution to $0.17 per unit beginning with the first quarter of 2017. And in addition, we've also announced an incremental $250 million to our buyback authorization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our results in more detail
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. This quarter let me first touch on AUM and fee-paying AUM. Page two of the supplement highlights the growth in assets in the last 12 months. AUM and fee-paying AUM were up 8% and 11% respectively, driven by record organic capital raised. All told, we now have $38 billion of dry powder as of December 31, a 28% increase year-over-year. And looking more broadly, as you can see on the bottom of page two, since the end of 2010, we've seen AUM and fee-paying AUM double, with the meaningful part of that coming from diversification across the firm. Growth in Public Markets from 2010 to 2016 shows the extent of this diversification, with fee-paying AUM increasing by six times over that period. We ended the fourth quarter with record fee-paying AUM of $101 billion. This includes $11.9 billion of third-party capital committed to Americas XII, which was activated at the very end of the quarter. Please turn to page 3. On the left side of the chart, you can see that the increase in fee-paying AUM has in turn resulted in the management fee growth and diversification, with fees growing at a 10% CAGR since 2010. And now that Americas XII is turned on, we are entitled to management fees on that third-party portion of that capital. At the same time, now that NAXI switched to the post-investment period, we received management fees based upon remaining cost. Simply said, Americas XII will add about $90 million to our 2017 management fee on a run rate basis. Turning to our total segment financials, management, monitoring and transaction fees were $256 million in total in Q4. Management fees were up year-over-year, and now that Americas XII has turned on, we will begin to see the impact of management fees starting in Q1. Total management, monitoring and transaction fees were down on a year-over-year basis, as Q4 of last year benefited from approximately $115 million of monitoring and transaction fees related to the First Data IPO, which was a one-time event. Turning to total performance income, we reported $241 million, which was anchored by a robust level of realization activity with over $500 million of realized carried interest in the quarter. Page 4 highlights this activity. In total, realization events at several portfolio companies drove the doubling of cash carry compared to last year. And this quarter's exits were broad-based. On a blended basis, the PE exits were done at 2.9 times our cost. The exits include our final sale of Walgreens, which was an excellent investment for us. In 2007, we invested $2.1 billion out of the 2006 and Europe II funds. Inclusive of the recent Galenica sale, we've now returned over $7 billion of realized cash proceeds to our fund investors, representing a 3.3 times realized multiple of money. Shifting to investment income, our final exit in Walgreens, in particular, drove a sizeable realized gain given our co-investment and fund exposure in that company. This though was offset by a loss from our investment in Samson. As a result of prior downward marks, this loss has no impact at all on ENI and that's important to note. Absent our Samson loss, the after-tax distributable earnings would have been $0.79 per unit. Total investment income of $167 million was helped by the positive marks seen across all of our strategies, including private equity, energy, real estate and alternative credit, driving $141 million of unrealized gains. Bringing it all together, on a total reportable segment basis, fee related earnings came in at $116 million. Our after-tax distributable earnings were $390 million, with after-tax ENI of $339 million. Moving to deployment, we invested $2.5 billion of capital this quarter. Public Markets deployment was $1.6 billion, up meaningfully relative to the pace of deployment over the last several quarters. This deployment came from investments made across our alternative credit vehicles, primarily within Special Sits and Direct Lending. And as you recall, we're entitled to economics on our alternative credit vehicles on an invested as opposed to committed basis. Given this dynamic, deployment in these strategies contributed to the increase in public markets fee-paying AUM this quarter. On the Private Markets side, we invested about $900 million. The largest contributors were a private equity investment a Hispanic food retailer out of NAXI and an investment in India's second-largest private life insurance company out of Asia II. Looking forward, we have an excellent pipeline of activity which Scott will discuss in more detail. And finally, as you've likely seen in our press release, we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized an additional $250 million to our share buyback plan. In addition, reflecting the continued growth of the firm and our strong fundamentals, we plan to increase our next fixed distribution by 6%, and our planned quarterly distribution will increase from $0.16 per quarter to $0.17 per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2017. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill and thanks everybody for joining our call today. We find that the fourth quarter call is a really good opportunity for us to reflect on our progress as a firm over the past 12 months, and looking back, despite a lot of market and geopolitical volatility, we're pleased with our progress in 2016 and with the fundamentals we're seeing across our firm and businesses. As we've said before, there are five things that we need to do well. I'm going to briefly update you on our progress on each of these. The first thing we need to do well is generate investment performance. Performance in the quarter and full year was strong and broad based. In private equity, our portfolio appreciated 3.4% in the quarter and 11.9% in the full-year 2016. Within real assets, our more mature real estate, energy and infrastructure flagship funds were up 4%, 23% and 21%, respectively, in the last 12 months. And in credit, we continue to see strong performance in our opportunistic credit and direct lending platforms in particular. The second thing we need to do well is raise capital. We had a very active fundraising year last year, raising a record $29 billion. Private Markets accounted for $16 billion of the capital raise, driven by Americas XII, our new growth strategies, and our real-estate platform. And Public Markets accounted for the other $13 billion, driven by CLOs, liquid credit mandates, and our strategic partnerships. And importantly, the quality of the capital that we've been raising is quite high. On a blended basis, of the $29 billion of new capital raised, roughly 80% is carry or incentive fee eligible and locked up for at least eight years from inception. Given the success we've had in our fundraising, we now have record fee-paying AUM, and we believe 2017 is going to be another active fundraising year as we scale our newer businesses and also focus on Asia Private Equity, providing direct line of sight to future fee growth. The third thing we need to do well is find new, compelling investment opportunities. We deployed $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $11 billion in 2016. If you turn to page five of the deck, you can see we've also announced several pending transactions expected to close in the first half of 2017, including Airbus out of European Fund IV, Calsonic and Hitachi Koki out of Asia II, and Calvin Capital out of Infrastructure II. When you put it all together, in aggregate, we've already announced over $10 billion of transactions that are expected to close in 2017, requiring about $3 billion of equity from our funds. The fourth thing we need to do is monetize our existing investments. As Bill mentioned, this was a strong monetization quarter and year for us. Looking at the full year, we returned $13.5 billion of cash to our Private Markets investors, helping to drive $1.5 billion of after-tax distributable earnings. And the last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets, and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors in the firm from all of our activities. It's important to remember that capital markets and the balance sheet do not show up in our AUM, but they are powerful economic contributors for the firm. Our capital markets capabilities, alongside the balance sheet, allow us to source large transactions and move quickly in the market. This allows us to scale all of our businesses more rapidly while generating fee economics for the firm. Our activity level here has continued to increase. In 2016 in Capital Markets, as an example, we executed 117 transactions involving $65 billion of total financings in equity and debt. Looking forward, KCM has begun 2017 with a high level of activity and an excellent pipeline. The balance sheet facilitates our model and a good performance in Q4, up 2.8%. We made good progress evolving our balance sheet asset allocation last year. We've reduced our overall CLO exposure and increased our commitment to our own funds, including Americas XII. We've also continued to use the balance sheet to seed new strategies and accelerate growth. For example, similar to how we started our real estate platform, we seeded our new growth strategies off the balance sheet and used that track record to attract third-party capital. As a result, in December, the next-generation technology fund held its final close and will now be a fee and future carry contributor. As we always say, the balance sheet is a real strategic asset for us, allowing us to accelerate AUM growth and increase firm profitability. I'm going to spend a minute on one additional topic. We announced on Monday that KKR Prisma and PAAMCO are combining to create a new firm, which will be one of the largest in the liquid alternatives industry with over $30 billion of AUM. The Prisma team will be part of the new combined firm and KKR will retain a 39.9% ownership stake as a strategic partner. By way of background, KKR Prisma has grown significantly from $7.5 billion or so to $10 billion since the formation of our partnership in 2012. Similarly, PAAMCO has experienced strong growth due to its performance and its value proposition for clients. The two businesses are complementary, and once combined, will become one of the largest in the liquid alternatives industry, a space where scale and providing a full suite of client solutions really matters. The transaction provides us with more capabilities, increased operating flexibility and is accretive to our AUM and our growth profile. Pro forma for this transaction and using December 31 numbers, our hedge fund business, which now includes five strategic partnerships, will have $74 billion of assets under management, of which our pro rata share will be $24 billion. To bring it all together, our core fundamentals are summarized on page six of the deck. 2016 was a good year, but even more importantly, the work done last year laid the foundation for significant growth and progress in 2017 and beyond. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And Vince, actually before we get going, if we could ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, that'd be helpful just so we can make sure we can work our way through the queue.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. So, question on balance sheet and just philosophy from a strategic view, if you feel anything is shifting? In other words, you've had some big wins over time, but they were lumpy and had caused us some volatility from time to time. So, lot of cash. You talked about seeking higher-return opportunities in some of the co-invests, but maybe from a top down – do you approach it from a top down perspective? And do you have thoughts about trying to create a little more balance over time?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Glen. It's Scott. I'll take that. We do definitely approach it as a top down matter in the first instance. We have an asset allocation approach that we use in terms of how we want to get the balance sheet positioned in time. And we're working our way toward that asset allocation model and outcome that we've targeted. What you'll be seeing is we've got, though, to your point, we've got a couple of legacy positions. For example, the Walgreens position that we talked about today, it actually has been on the balance sheet since before the merger with KPE. So we've got some legacy positions that have been rolling off. And you're right, some of those are lumpy. But what we've been doing with the proceeds is committing that capital largely to our funds, which we think over time will create a less lumpy stream of outcomes, because there'd be less larger investments like a Walgreens, as an example, on the balance sheet in due course. And we've also been using the balance sheet to make investments strategically for the firm. So, for example, we had used balance sheet to create fee and carry opportunities, whether you think about that in terms of our hedge funds, strategic partnerships, or other acquisitions that we've made, which is really in our mind using balance sheet to create more stable and higher multiple fee profits for KKR over the long-term. So the balance sheet has been in transition. We've had the original KPE portfolio, which was largely private equity. We had the KFN merger, which was largely credit. And we spent the last couple of years really repositioning ourselves toward this asset allocation model that I referenced. And we're getting there. We're not quite there yet, but we've made good progress.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: Great. I appreciate that. And maybe just a quickie follow-up on, you gave good detail on slide 4 with the robust realization activity. You announced $10 billion in proceeds. Is there a DE number that corresponds with that? Sometimes on the quarter you'll have those along (19:08) with that math.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. So, Glenn, if you're talking about 2017, based upon the assets that are shown on this slide and assume all the monetizations take place, that's going to translate into roughly about $300 million of cash earnings.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Awesome. Thank you very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open, sir.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the (19:40) update as well. It's very helpful (19:42). So you mentioned a couple of different things in terms of capital raising (19:47) that Americas XII just got turned on. And you highlighted in your prepared remarks that Asia made scaling of some next gen funds and then strategics. Give me (19:58) sort of sense of sizing as you think through the opportunity set looking into this year?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Bill. Happy to take that. It's Scott. I'd say, you think about what we have in the market, probably is a good way to start. You're right that Americas XII, we're about done. We expect to hit the $12.5 billion hard cap which has been upsized slightly, and then our commitment will be on top of that. Asia III is in early stages. We're still on the market with our second real estate fund, our second private credit opportunistic fund, health care growth, Direct Lending III and different vehicles in our Real Estate Credit business. And then on top of that, we've got high-yield leverage loans, CLOs, separate accounts, our BDC and then our hedge fund strategic partnerships are obviously also accessing capital. So if you look at the list as a whole, it's a very active year for us in terms of what's on the docket for fundraising, and it's an excellent fundraising environment right now. And so we're finding a lot of opportunity, and a lot of clients want to engage with us across all these different topics. In terms of how to think about it, it's hard to give you a precise sizing for the year. I will point out that 2016 was a big year just by virtue of the fact that we had the Americas XII closings, and that $12.5 billion is a large fund for us. But I do think that if you aggregate these others, we're also going to hopefully have a very nice outcome for this year as well; not entirely clear sitting here it'll be as big as last year just by virtue of how big the Americas XII fundraise was, but I'm optimistic. The other thing that we're seeing is a continuation, just from a color standpoint, of the trends we've talked about in the past. You know, LPs wanting to do more with fewer consolidating their relationships and working with us across multiple asset classes. So we're encouraged by those trends continuing.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Bill.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: This is Bill Janetschek. Just one quick modeling point. Scott mentioned Americas XII and earlier I mentioned that we had turned on Americas XII as of January 1. Just keep in mind that we increased the hard cap to $12.5 billion and that would mean that if we actually do get to that $12.5 billion, which we anticipate happening, you'll see actually another $600 million of AUM and fee-paying AUM come online when that capital is raised. So I just want to make that modeling point.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And maybe, Bill, just to stay with you for a second, maybe it's just due to the big capital raise, but your other expense line within, sort of, the FRE calc looks, like it pops a little bit more than we maybe anticipated. What was the driver to that? And then how do you sort of think about go-forward level?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, you did see a slight increase this quarter and what ended up happening is, as is typical in a fourth quarter, for whatever reason that deal expenses just come in slightly higher in the fourth quarter, but more importantly if you look for the full-year 2016 to 2015, those other operating expenses were flat year-over-year. And so I would say from a modeling perspective, you should assume to model that number or maybe up 1% or 2%.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, good morning. I guess I always believe in looking more at people – what do than what they say, but I want you to comment on it. And just if you – we look at the build-up in your cash year-on-year from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion, your investments are down by $2 billion. And if I pair that with, kind of, what I would characterize as a, kind of, chintzy increase in the dividend and the buy-back, it kind of telegraphs that you're really husbanding cash, building dry powder and kind of adopting a posture of extreme conservatism. And especially when I look at, like, again, the commitments to the funds are kind of flat quarter-on-quarter and I realize you've raised a lot of cash, but it looks like you're just building cash at every moment – at every opportunity. So comment on that.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Chris and good morning.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Maybe just to give you a couple of things to look at as you think about the cash level, because I characterized it as a moment in time consideration. So you're right, the cash went up through the course of the year. We did have a lot of realizations as we talked about. Couple of things we look at, is if you look at page 17 of the press release, just putting the $3.4 billion cash number in context, when it (24:58) shows up on that table is about $2.6 billion of uncalled commitments that we have to our funds. And as we've said and telegraphed, we're making more commitments to our funds. We also plan to be making some co-investments in individual transactions across the firm's different strategies. The page 17 detail does not yet include our Asia III fund. And so we would expect to also make a meaningful commitment to that fund as well, as we seek to increase our exposure to Asia across our balance sheet asset allocation approach. So that would, in the first instance, point you to that, and say, we've been making these commitments and expect to make more. Secondly, with respect to the commentary, obviously, we did reload the buyback program to some extent. We did increase the dividend by 6%. And I do think you're right, we believe that we have been kind of committing capital smartly, and we like where we are a few years out as a result of the commitments we're making now. But we also, on the margin, are being thoughtful about retaining capital to be able to be opportunistic, whether that is to fund new growth strategies for the firm, like our real estate business or some of the things we're doing in the growth areas or, frankly, just to wait for periods of dislocation where we find interesting investment opportunities. So we're working to get the balance right. But I wouldn't overreact to what's kind of the moment-in-time year-end cash balance, because a lot of that's been committed to future strategies.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Good morning. Thank you. Obviously, it's changing a lot around proposed tax legislation. But your approach, having the big balance sheet, is fairly unique. I'm wondering, is there anything in the kind of broad package that's kind of floating out there that would make that policy more or less attractive to you? Because I don't think it's exposed to carry tax (27:07).
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Patrick. This is Bill. Suffice to say, what's going on down in Washington has been quite dynamic. There's a lot of snippets coming out as to what proposed legislation might get passed. But to be quite honest, it's early days. It's something that we're going to monitor. And as we get more clarity around what's going on, we'd probably be best able to comment then.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Fair enough. And then, just quickly on the $90 million increase in management fees, should we expect any incremental expense on that?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Not really. There's always going to be some compensation element to anything that we do but, certainly on the G&A side, the answer is no.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Maybe starting here within private equity and just thinking about the pace of investments for Americas XII, and when you look at interest rates as an input into deals, assuming the forward curve right now is correct, where our (28:31) interest rates will be moving higher, is there a sense of urgency at all to get some deals done to take advantage of lower interest rates? Or do you actually maybe, on the other hand, sit back and wait longer than you otherwise would, just because there could be some dislocations if we're going into that backdrop? I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that input.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Devin. It's Scott. The short answer is, no, it's not changing how we're thinking about deployment. If you really run out a buyout model, as an example, and you move LIBOR by 25 basis points, 50 basis points, even 100 basis points, over time, it really does not have a dramatic impact on returns. What's far more important, frankly, is the availability of the capital and the valuations you're paying for the asset upfront, and kind of critically, what you do with the asset while you own it in terms of growth. So, all of those would kind of dwarf the impact of any nominal move in interest rates.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Terrific. And then, maybe coming back to tax reform, I understand you can't commit to anything today, because as you guys, mentioned it is dynamic, but I'm sure you're following closely. So just as you're thinking about some of the puts and takes of what you're reading about coming out of Washington, D.C, is there anything that you're looking for that would make you feel differently about the corporate structure, or even certain levels of where tax rates could go or deductions that could stay or go away, that would kind of make you feel like this is the level where we should consider a change to the corporate structure?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Devin. This is Bill. Getting back to taxes again, it all depends on what happens with carried interest. And so if carried interest is treated as still investment income, but it's taxed at a higher rate, our structure will not have to pay tax. It will still flow to our unitholders. However, if they decide that carried interest is going to be technical, non-qualified income, and then it ends up having to run through the corporate blocker, we would be subject to corporate tax on that. Then the other toggle that you have to think about is, what is the corporate rate going to go down to? And so right now, the federal corporate rate is at 35%. If it got down to a rate where, all-in, you take a look at what the true tax leakage is for us being a corporation, and by then becoming a C corp, the universe of possible investors we could introduce ourselves to, it's something that, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're certainly focused on and monitoring, but it's still way too early to tell where everything is going to settle out.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Got it. But, I mean, philosophically, to the extent you had to take maybe a little bit of economic dilution, if you will, with that thought, there could be some valuation benefit that would go into the equation. It doesn't have to be economically neutral.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: You're right. You're right, Devin. We'll look at it on the behalf of all of our shareholders of which we're the largest and try to do the equation and think about what is the incremental tax cost relative to the potential valuation uplift. And once the facts become a little bit more clear, we'll continue to do that calculus and keep you updated on our thinking.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yes. Terrific. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends, maybe, in the various hedge fund businesses and investments, Marshall Wace and Prisma, I mean, $24 billion is still a significant chunk of your AUM, at least your pro rata share. Could you give us an update maybe on, kind of, what the new business trends are like underneath there and kind of the outlook from your perspective?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, very happy to. I'd say – let's back up and, kind of, look at the overall platform and what we're doing in hedge funds taken as a whole. And as I mentioned, we've got now five strategic partnerships. And before the announcement of the PAAMCO Prisma transaction, we were seeing nice growth across the overall platform. A lot of that, frankly, has been driven by our partnership with Marshall Wace, which is off to a wonderful start. You know, the AUM of Marshall Wace has grown about 50% since we created the partnership; great partner relationships, strong, deep. We're doing a lot of different things together and we're very optimistic as to our ability to do a lot more together in the future. And Marshall Wace has been growing. Nephila has been growing. And, as I mentioned, Prisma has been growing. So taken as a whole, we have seen nice growth across the platform. If you look at the strategic partners, taking Prisma out of it for a minute, we saw very attractive growth last year, 10%-plus in AUM. And so what we've been trying to do is think about how this space is evolving. Our overall perspective is that kind of rumors of the demise of the hedge fund industry are vastly over-stated. And we do believe that this feels a little bit tough like private equity felt in 2008 and 2009, that it's still a very large space. There's a little bit of negativity out there, but the scale players with competitive advantages will do well. And so the way that we've really thought about it, Robert, is that we need to have either scale or be a strong niche player to be able to be successful. And so with Prisma PAAMCO, we'll have a scale player, top-three in the solutions space that's doing a lot more than just fund to funds with direct investing, LDI and a variety of other things. We think we can grow even faster together with PAAMCO than we could on our own. With Marshall Wace, we've got systematic and long-short on a global basis with a lot of scale. And then with Nephila and BlackGold, we've got niche. And so we've been able to grow the platform. And we're more optimistic post this strategic move that we can grow more from here. And the only other thing I'd add is that we are learning from our partners in terms of how they run their businesses; it's helping us in terms of how we run ours. And Marshall Wace in particular, we're spending a lot of time with in terms of comparing notes on what they're doing and what we're doing.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Maybe as a follow-up to that, has their plugging into your distribution helped accelerate their growth, particularly at Marshall Wace?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I think we've been able to make introductions to each other, frankly. They've also been introducing us to some of their clients. So the answer is, yes. It's not been a big driver of kind of the logic behind the partnership, but where we've got the opportunity to help each other, we absolutely are.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just a follow-on on the PAAMCO Prisma. I guess it closes in the second quarter, I believe. Any impact in the way the financials are stated on that? Any impact on fee-paying AUM that you can talk about? And also I think one of your other partnerships, Avoca Credit, if you want to also just comment on the status of that as well. And then maybe just linking in with that, with the fee growth from NAXI XII turning on the $90 million extra, sounds like with the fundraising that you've got in the pipeline, even net of the distributions, we should be growing management fees more than the $90 million for 2017. If you could give some color on that.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Brian. This is Bill. You clearly broke the Craig Larson rule of just one question. I think you had three, so I'll tackle them in order. As it relates to the Prisma PAAMCO transaction, we hope that it will close some time in the second quarter. And when you think about it on the combined business, we're looking this from an ENI perspective as upfront a relatively neutral trade. So don't expect the income to go up or down just on the combination itself. But to Scott's earlier point, to the extent that the scaled platform becomes larger, we see the potential for significant growth opportunities prospectively, but again, on the initial transaction closing, you can think of it roughly as a push. As it relates to Avoca, that's a much different transaction. That was really a merger. And we were strong in credit in the U.S. and we really didn't have a presence in Europe, and so that acquisition took place in 2013. The way we look at that, Avoca is for the most part gone away, and now we have just a global credit platform. People that were at Avoca in Dublin are now in San Francisco. People that are in San Francisco are now in Dublin. And so I couldn't even tell you the true performance of Avoca as a standalone entity, because we don't run the business that way anymore. It's a combined platform.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yes. One thing I'd just jump in here, Brian, it's Scott, is it is an important distinction. So Avoca was an acquisition for the firm and a full integration with our credit platform. So think of it as that's now part of the 100% owned credit business that we have, and it gave us the European leverage credit and CLO capabilities that we did not have prior to the deal. And it's worked out great. So we're very happy with how that's played out. Our approach to hedge funds has been markedly different. We've kind of taken the view that we're better to have a handful of strategic partnerships with very strong players where we own a portion of their business and help each other, but we do not integrate it. So we've been trying to take a methodical approach to building these five different strategic partnerships across the different areas that I mentioned before, and we think that's the best approach for us in the hedge fund space. And as a reminder, we're doing this off our balance sheet, and so it's with our own capital. So it creates meaningful profitability and flow-through for all of us as shareholders. So, quite a bit different, Avoca, fully-owned and integrated. Hedge funds, kind of more a third-party partial ownership stakes through the balance sheet for strategic reasons.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Great. And then just on the management fee outlook?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. When you think about where we're going to come out in 2017, we feel pretty comfortable right now. Management fees in 2017 are going to be higher than 2016. We already talked about the impact with Americas XII going live, but then when you think about the other platforms we've got, Scott had mentioned Asia III, we're out raising capital for that. Once that closes, and that will probably be in the back-half of 2017, then we've got Asia I, Asia II and Asia III all earning fees. And depending on the size the close on Asia III, that could be another significant needle mover as far as management fees are concerned. Another thing to keep in mind is, remember, on Public Markets, we've got about $6.5 billion of dry powder that's in AUM that we've already raised, and we won't actually receive management fees until it's deployed. And so we talked about the robust activity in 2016 in the fourth quarter. Now that we have that capital in the ground, that will impact to higher management fees in 2017. So we've got that to look forward to in 2017 as well. Plus, any other mandates that we are raising capital for. And I'm not going to go through them all; Scott already covered them. But on the negative side, obviously, to the extent that, and this is the way the model works, we have monetizations. You're actually going to see some of the funds that are in a post-investment period, like the 2006 Fund and now NAXI, as we sell those investments, we're going to lose that capital and lose the ability to charge management fees. But pretty optimistic on where we'll be in 2017 from a management fee perspective.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Great. That's great color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Yes. As you're activating Fund XII here, I think it would be helpful if maybe you guys can give us an update on what industry valuations look like. And then maybe as you frame that answer, some of these recent deployments, maybe you can help us with what kind of valuation multiples those deals are coming through at.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. It's Scott. I'm happy to try to take that. So I'd say, overall, valuations in the Americas, and so you just put this in context, Americas private equity's about 25%, 30% of our AUM, give or take. And as an overall reminder, we got half our investment executives outside the U.S. So I just want to put it in context. But Americas PE valuations were high before the election, and have become even higher after the election. And so, we're working to be creative to find value, I guess, would be the high-level summary. And looking at opportunities where we can leverage our industry expertise, our operational capabilities, to really find something that's more idiosyncratic. And so, we're having to be patient to find good opportunities. But as Bill mentioned, and as we lay out on slide 5 in the deck, we are finding some interesting things to do. At the same time, we're selectively monetizing. We did a deal for U.S. Foods. We sold Capsugel. The portfolio is performing well. But on the new deal front, I'd say it's selective, idiosyncratic, patience, defined value, and stay disciplined on not overpaying. And we are able to find things to do in this environment. It just requires a bit more work and a bit more creativity and using the whole model of the firm. In answer to your question, in terms of some of the recent transactions that we've done, if you look in the U.S. in particular, the valuation ranges have gone from as low as 4 times EBITDA to as high as 9 to 10 times, for more growth. And one thing I'll say about our portfolio as a whole is, we have seen quite a bit of growth. We're still growing our revenues and EBITDA high-single digits plus, and we are finding opportunities to invest in companies that are seeing those kind of growth opportunities. It just takes a bit more work to find, as I mentioned.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Gotcha. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up, if I may, on Prisma. Would you guys characterize this move as offensive or defensive? And I know they are scale benefits to putting the two firms together, but I'm a little unclear of what other benefits there are. So maybe if you could just highlight those, that would be helpful.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, I would characterize it as offensive. I mean, I think the way that I would look at this, and the way we've thought about this internally is, we had a business that we invested in, partnered with, that was growing well. And the industry we're in continued to evolve. And so what happened is, with the fund-of-funds, quote unquote, industry really evolved to one where it wasn't just fund of funds anymore. It was direct investing. It was liability-driven investing, a variety of other ways that we could work with clients, and clients were looking for broader solutions. And so what was happening with us is a few things as we grew the business. One, we started to build new products ,and one of the things we found as we were building new products, especially on the direct-investing side is, there were aspects of being in the KKR regulatory and compliance infrastructure that didn't actually allow us to move as quickly as we liked in some instances. And so we thought about this and said, okay, what's most important in this industry. Scale is more important; transparency; the ability to build new products with flexibility. And what we figured out is that we could be more offensive if we had more scale and an ability to move more quickly on the new product front. And putting that all together, we determined that it made sense to be offensive, find a partner that would give us that scale, and we think getting into number three in this space is important. And we decided that having a partner that would allow us to do all of those things would position the investment that we'd made in Prisma to have even greater growth in the future. And so I'd put it very much in the offensive category and reacting to what we saw was happening in the industry and where we think the industry is going. But the most important thing is, you got to create solutions for clients, and this partnership allows us to create more.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Michael Anthony Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Mike Needham in for Mike Carrier. First on book value growth, it looks like our ROE continues to improve. So I'm just wondering how confident are you that you'll be able to drive book value growth over the next, say, two years assuming relative stable markets, which I know is a big assumption? But I'm just thinking about the other value-creation drivers apart from markets and your shift to investing more in your funds.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. It's Scott, I'll take that. I'd say we feel quite good about it. Your base assumption of steady markets, obviously important, but the model that we've built is one where hopefully we'll be able to continue to build value on our balance sheet investments and that will compound. So that'll create book value growth, will generate fee-related earnings and carry-related earnings in excess of our dividend, and that retained capital on the margin after doing the buybacks and other things we've committed to over time, I think will allow book value to growth. And so book value in aggregate will grow, and hopefully we're thoughtful in terms of how we use our buyback programs. So book value per share will hopefully grow at an even faster rate. So, we feel quite good about it. We like how the balance sheet is positioned and the investments that we've made, and our focus is, as you say, growing book value per share, and at the same time, growing our third-party AUM profitability.
Michael Anthony Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the $3 billion of recent deployment announcements that are pending, will any of those drive any upsized transaction fees or are there other items that could drive higher transaction fees over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: This is Bill. If you look at the supplement on page 5, we list out the investments that we're talking about, and nothing abnormal as far as upsized transaction fees. Generally speaking, this transaction fees that we charge are roughly in the neighborhood of 1% of total enterprise value or which gets you down based upon debt to equity, about 3% (48:06) of the equity invested. And so it's probably the same old, same old.
Michael Anthony Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick one on Prisma PAAMCO. Do you have any stats on LP overlap? How many LPs they have that you don't work with and vice versa?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good question, Patrick. The businesses are very complementary, almost to a spooky extent. So there's very little client overlap, very little product overlap. We've been developing new products, as had they. And those do not overlap at all. They're going to actually fit in quite nicely and complementary to each other. Different approach in terms of generally pricing in the market. So the products themselves I don't think are going to be cannibalizing each other because there's different approaches for different clients. So quite complementary across the board. And we think working together, we will be able to work with even more clients and do a better job for them, given all the new product opportunities that we have, in addition to those already in place. So really very little overlap is the punch line.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I see no other questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Larson for any closing comments.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Vince. Thanks, everyone for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, please feel free to call us directly. Otherwise, look forward to chatting next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks for – the conference will be open for questions. At that time instructions will be provided. I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you, David. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO, and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is on the Investor Center section of our website at kkr.com. This call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And importantly, like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning we reported strong third quarter results. These results reflect a lot of the themes we've been talking about over the last few quarter, so because of this, we'll be able to move quickly through the results for the quarter and move into Q&A. For the quarter itself, economic net income was $669 million, or $0.71 of after-tax economic net income per unit. After-tax total distributable earnings were $461 million, or $0.57 per unit, and our book value increased to $11.95 per unit. We've again also announced our regular $0.16-per-unit distribution. If you can turn to page two of the presentation for a moment, this highlights the main themes that we'll expand on over the next 10 or 15 minutes. Strong underlying investment performance, continued healthy monetization activity, as well as continued success from a fundraising and AUM standpoint and the resulting impact this has on our management fee profile. Overall, we continue to feel extremely well positioned in this market environment and believe the positive fundamentals we're seeing across the firm, with the added benefit of long-term locked-up capital and a significant balance sheet, will allow us to continue to grow and create value over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig. We had strong investment performance, both on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, across our carry paying funds. This performance, which Scott will discuss in more detail, contributed to the positive results we've reported this morning. Focusing on our total segment financials, management, monitoring and transaction fees were $277 million in total, up 5% from Q2, with management fees again exceeding $200 million. Transaction fees generated from equity investments in several large North America private equity deals, most notably Epicor and UFC, were the key contributors to total fee growth. Turning to total performance income, we reported $424 million, which was anchored by a robust level of realization activity, with $350 million of realized carried interest in the quarter. Page three highlights this activity. In total, realization events at several portfolio companies drove the 15% increase in cash-carry compared to last quarter. And this quarter's exits were broad-based. On a blended basis, the PE exits were done at 2.6 times our cost and an IRR of 26%. Strong marks across the portfolio also contributed favorably to the total performance income as unrealized gains were up nicely this quarter. Shifting to investment income, exit at Walgreens and Zimmer in particular drove the realized gains, given our sizable co-investment and fund exposure in these companies. Total investment income of $330 million was also held by the positive marks seen across other strategies, including CLOs, energy and alternative credit, driving $137 million of unrealized gains. Bringing it all together, on a total reportable segment basis, fee-related earnings came in at $142 million, after-tax distributable earnings were $461 million, with after-tax ENI of $598 million. Moving to AUM and fee-paying AUM, page four of the supplement highlights the growth in AUM over the last 12 months. As Craig mentioned, our AUM is up 17% over this period, driven by $28 billion of organic capital raise. We've now raised close to $12 billion of capital for Americas XII, and we're confident the opening fund size will be in excess of $13 billion. We've also made good progress on second-generation funds. In the quarter, AUM increased slightly despite the active monetization backdrop. Inflows in private equity, real estate credit, CLOs, alternative credit, and hedge funds were the big contributors. The right-hand side of page five provides a few compelling stats on the $21 billion of capital we've raised that is not yet earning economics. All of it is carry or incentive-fee eligible, with effectively all of it locked up for eight-plus years from inception. And while you haven't yet seen the impact on our management fees, this capital will contribute roughly $250 million annually in gross fees once invested, or in the case of Americas XII, once the fund in turned on. This dynamic positions us well for management fee growth and we have a direct line of sight on that growth. Moving to deployment, we invested over $3.7 billion of capital this quarter, primarily within private markets. The largest contributors were three private equity investments made out of NAXI, which is now 75% invested, as well as two Indonesian investments out of Asia II. On the public market side, most of the $1.5 billion in deployment came from investments made across our alternative credit vehicles, primarily within direct lending and Special Sits. And as you'll recall, we're entitled to economics on alternative credit vehicles on an invested, as opposed to committed, basis. Given this dynamic, deployment in these strategies contributed to the increase in public markets fee-paying AUM this quarter. In total, the $3.7 billion in deployment still leaves us with approximately $38 billion of dry powder across the firm as of September 30, a 40% increase year-over-year. Finally, looking forward, the pipeline for future monetizations remains full as we've already announced six strategic sales that have or are expected to close in Q4. These sales are diversified across geography, with three in Asia, two in Europe and one in North America. On a blended basis these exits, which have an average holding period of only 3.5 years, are expected to yield 2.1 times our cost, an IRR of 27%, and subject to closing will contribute over $150 million of distributable earnings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill, and thank you everybody for joining our call. We had a very good quarter. It was a quarter that evidences the power and simplicity of our model. If you cut through it, we really need to do five things well: generate investment performance, raise capital, find attractive new investments, monetize existing investments, and use our model of AUM, capital markets and balance sheet to generate significant economics from our investment activities. I'm going to touch briefly on each of these. Let's hit investment performance first. Take a look at page six of the supplement. In private equity, our portfolio appreciated nearly 6% in the quarter. And if you look more closely at our benchmark private equity funds, on a year-to-date basis, our North American, European and Asian PE funds shown in the center of the chart are up 16%, 18% and 23% respectively. In our non-PE strategies, we're also seeing strong investment performance. Of particular note, our infrastructure strategies continue to perform, with our infrastructure fund up 4% in the quarter and 19% on a year-to-date basis. We saw a rebound in our energy portfolio, given the improved operating environment in the quarter, and we also saw strong performance across our alternative credit funds, with our Special Situations, Mezzanine and direct lending funds up 4%, 5% and 3% respectively in Q3. The second thing we need to do well is raise capital. We've raised $28 billion in the last 12 months, and have line of sight to significant management fee growth from our capital commitments not yet earning economics. Over a five-year period our AUM has grown at a 17% annual growth rate. And as you can see on page seven of the deck, our AUM is long-dated and diversified by strategy. More than 60% of our fee-paying AUM is in strategies outside of private equity, and over 70% of the capital is locked up for at least eight years from inception. The third thing we need to do well is find new, compelling investment opportunities. This was a very active deployment quarter for us across the firm, with a total of $3.7 billion deployed across businesses and geographies. The fourth thing we need to do is monetize our existing investments. Bill walked you through it, but the bottom line is we're continuing to see significant monetization activity across our PE business, and we're beginning to see more activity across our non-PE businesses. Our carry is more recurring than the markets perceive. We've consistently returned an average of $10 billion annually to our fund LPs for the last several years, and this is the 26th consecutive quarter as a public company that we have realized performance income in our financial statements. The last thing we need to do well is use our model of AUM, capital markets and balance sheet to capture greater economics for our investors and the firm from all of our activities. KCM and the balance sheet do not show up in our AUM, but they are powerful economic contributors for the firm and allow us to move quickly and in scale to source investments, maximize our value creation, seed new efforts, and scale our third-party AUM more quickly. KCM had a really good quarter, as did our balance sheet investments, which appreciated 5% in Q3. And we're making good progress evolving our balance sheet asset allocation, and using the balance sheet as a strategic weapon to facilitate AUM growth and increase our participation in the profitability of the firm. Now please take a look at page eight, which brings it all together. This quarter really showed the power of our model. We generated strong performance, we continue to raise capital, we're making new investments, we're monetizing existing investments, and we're using our model. The result is significant economic net income and distributable earnings with very good visibility ahead. In essence, we feel our model is performing well and our fundamentals are strong. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: And David, it's Craig. Just before we open it up for questions, just as we look at the queue here, we see we actually have a pretty long list of people. So if we could ask everyone in the queue to please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up, and then get back in the queue if necessary, we'd appreciate it.
Operator: Our first question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey good morning, guys.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Morning.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I wanted to touch on realizations a bit. It was another strong quarter for realizations, distributable earnings. I just wanted to see what the potential was and how you're thinking about the fixed dividend to move higher over time, and if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more on the internal criteria you guys are evaluating to make that decision? Thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Ken. This is Bill Janetschek. We're not going to comment on the change in our distribution this quarter, that will be something that we'll address in future quarters. We only announced this just three quarters ago. So, stay tuned.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, that's something we can I guess expect annually then, or is there any set timeline for that?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: As I said, we're not going to address the change in our distribution this quarter, and it's something that we'll address in future quarters.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. There is no announcement to make today, Ken. When we made the change we said it's probably something that we're going to visit more or less annually, we'll keep an eye on kind of flow-through tax burden to our investors, but nothing to announce today, and we'll keep you posted.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Just I guess a follow-up for me then on fund raising. So 12 months, you guys mentioned some really strong trends this quarter, it seemed to slow a little bit. Just wondering if you can give an update then on the outlook here, near-term and even longer term, as to how you're looking at the fundraising environment?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say that, Ken, the fundraising environment remains very strong and a good one for us. We've got a lot of different products that we're talking to investors about, and the overall backdrop is great. I'd say people are looking for places to invest to generate returns, and in particular yield, and that plays to our strength, and we're seeing more allocations to alternatives and investors looking to do more. So we have another – a number of products in the market, including wrapping up our Americas XII fund, our second opportunistic real estate fund, our second private credit opportunities fund. We have two products in growth equity, we've got various things going on in real estate credit. And then some successor funds that are coming in direct lending in Asia, and that's on top of everything we're doing in hedge funds and leveraged credit. So, continues to be a lot of activity and a lot of different things that we're talking to investors about on a global basis.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate the color there. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. First question, on management fees. Appreciate the disclosure around your capital commitments and what that could do to management fee revenue, but I guess the one part of the equation we don't have is how monetizations might impact the outlook for that. So any kind of guidance, or directionally can you guys help us out, thinking about your management fee earnings growths potential over the next one year or two years? Thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Chris, this is Bill Janetschek. When you look at – looking out certainly over 2017, as we've mentioned, our NAXI fund is roughly about 75% invested. We'll always have a certain amount that we'll set aside for reserve, and so it won't be long before the Americas XII fund turns on, and that would be sometime certainly in the first half of 2017. And once that does happen, based on supplemental information we've provided last quarter, you will see an increase in fees on a run rate basis of roughly about $95 million. Now what that doesn't take into account is your very excellent point in that it doesn't address some of the run-off on the existing funds that are going from the post-investment period, where we collect a reduced fee, to those – and that capital actually being monetized and us not collecting a fee. I would say that if you wanted to swag somewhere in the neighborhood when you're looking at 2017, 2018, even with the runoff, the management fees, based upon information we know today, will be higher.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Very helpful, thanks. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. Just a question on the buyback, looks like it slowed a little bit in the quarter – or I guess the period that was disclosed. Perhaps you could talk just a little bit about the evaluation process there and kind of how you weigh that against other capital deployment opportunities? Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Great. Thanks, Gerald. It's Scott, I'll take it. Look, I think just by the way of background, so we announced the $500 million authorization about a year ago. And in total, between shares bought back and tax cancellation, we've bought back or canceled about 37 million shares so far. So the share count's down, net, probably a little bit – certainly on or slightly ahead of pace of where we'd expected to be. And in answer to your question, look, we really view cash as a strategic asset for us, so we've got a number of growth and innovation opportunities across the firm, and you've seen us over the last several years seed a number of new efforts. Most recently things that we've done in growth equity and in real estate credit off the balance sheet. And so there's nothing new to announce today. I think we've said in prior quarters that you should model our share count flat over time, and that's certainly what we expect to deliver. So, nothing new to share with you today. We're really focused on how we invest that capital and build the firm for the long term, as opposed to any short-term trading dynamics. But that's how we suggest you think about it, just keep the share count flat over the longer term.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. And just – just a follow up, sort of looking at some of the fund performance, looks like Lending Partners – Lending Partners II, in fact, had a pretty sizable move, quarter-over-quarter in terms of fair value. Is that – perhaps you could just give a little bit of color there, on what the dynamic is and perhaps even kind of what the opportunity set from the investments are there? That would be helpful. Thanks you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. Nothing out of the ordinary, some exits and some strong underlying portfolio company performance in the quarter, and frankly just a little bit of ramping up the portfolio as that's a younger fund. So nothing that we'd point you to except the underlying trend that we've been seeing for the last several years, which we do see a lot of opportunities in direct lending, both in the U.S. and Europe. And as we've said in prior quarters, we raised our European direct lending fund not long ago. We'll be in the market shortly with our third Lending Partners fund. But overall, just good portfolio performance and strong opportunities in the market as we continue to see the banks pull back.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And Gerald, just one thing to add, and this is just a subtlety, but remember in direct lending, in the vehicle itself there is some leverage, so we typically put up $1 of equity and borrow roughly about $0.50 on the $1. So to the extent that there is performance, you're going to see better performance due to the subtlety of the leverage in the vehicle.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Understood. Thanks for the color.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Hi, good morning guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Question around the balance sheet. So given the improving pace of realizations, maybe spend a minute on how you envision the composition of the balance sheet evolve over the next kind of 12 to 18 months. What's kind of the optimal mix that we should think about on a go-forward basis? Again, once you kind of get through the current pace of realizations. And I guess more importantly, the impact this may have on net interest income and dividends? But that line has been I guess a little bit weaker this quarter, last quarter, so is a kind of a $25-ish million quarterly run rate still the right number to think about?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Great question, Alex. This is Scott again. I'll take it. So, in terms of what you've been seeing the last several quarters – so remember when we did the KFN merger a couple of years ago, we said at the time that we wanted to adjust the asset allocation to bring down our overall credit exposure because KFN had a heavy credit bias in that balance sheet, and redeploying to what we saw as higher returning strategies, and you've really seen us do that. So just by way of background, when we – around the time we closed the KFN deal we had about a $1.6 billion of CLO exposure on the balance sheet; that number is about $600 million now. And a significant amount of that freed-up capital from that change, amongst others, has gone into what we think are going to be higher returning strategies, and also areas that have allowed us to raise third-party capital alongside the balance sheet and we can generate a very attractive ROE. So relative to where we are today, one good place to look is on page 18 of the press release, which is where we've got our uncalled commitments. And as you can see, if you look at this over the last several quarters, you can see we've been increasing our commitments to private market strategies in particular, and the largest of those has been the Americas Fund XII commitment that now shows up on the table at $1 billion. And so over time, I think you should expect us to see the private equity component of the balance sheet continue to go back up, probably closer to historical levels in that 35% to 40% range. You'll probably see a bias for credit to continue to come down, and where we have it, see more bias to alternative credit, and you can see the large commitment we've got to the Special Situations Fund II strategy as an example of that. And then also we have commitments to our healthcare growth strategies, technology growth and various real estate strategies where we think that there's higher return opportunities. So you'll see us getting into an asset allocation range that looks something closer to that, think roughly 35%, 40% PE, and the rest spread across other asset classes with a continuing reduction of our credit exposure over time.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And Alex, and to your last question as far as run rate is concerned, obviously with the call of 2007-1, Scott mentioned you could see the CLO that we had on balance sheet has been monetized. And so from an interest and dividend run-rate point of view, I would say that the $70 million that you're seeing right now in the quarter is going to be pretty close to what you would expect. That number might go down to $60 million, but you're doing it on a net basis, taking into account the run-rate interest expense of about $50 million. So I would say that the number we have here for the third quarter is going to be close to the run rate that you should expect.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. Hi, thanks. Guys, just given the performance both in the funds, but also on the balance sheet in the quarter, just wanted to get a little bit more insight. I know we can do a lot in terms of tracking the public investments. But when you look on the private side, just any trends in terms of whether it's top-line EBITDA growth, and then how the CLOs, the energy part of the portfolio, did in the quarter?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Mike. It's Scott. Happy to take that. In terms of the – just let me take the second piece first. So the CLOs in the quarter had a good strong quarter, up 5.6% give or take, in the quarter for our CLO portfolio, and we've continued to see good performance in the underlying portfolios that the teams are managing there. So I'd say overall very pleased with the performance we've had, and that's in the context of the, as we mentioned, of calling a bunch of the older CLOs and reducing our overall exposure to that book. So attractive returns. Importantly, that 5.6% in the quarter does not include the management fees we get on our CLO business. So when you incorporate those, it's actually a very attractive overall ROE business for us. In terms of the private equity portfolio, performance continues to be strong. If you look at a trailing 12 months basis, revenues up about 8% across the global portfolio, EBITDA also up about 8%, and so significantly outpacing the public markets on those metrics.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks. And then, well, I guess anything on energy, and then the follow-up was just on hedge funds. So obviously there was a lot of focus in the industry, you guys, it seems like the trends have held up better than what we're seeing throughout the industry. So any update there, when you look at your hedge fund exposure in terms of performance or on the flow trends, like demand for those products?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Mike, this is Bill. I'll take the first on energy and then I'll pass it over to Scott on hedge funds, but when you take a look at slide six in the supplement, you could see that the Energy Income & Growth Fund was up 14% for the quarter, 6% over the last nine months, and more specifically to your question around the balance sheet, happy to report that $50 million of income off the balance sheet was from our energy portfolio this quarter.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: And on hedge funds, Mike, I'd just give couple of comments. I think obviously the industry has had a lot of media attention as of late, and the broad perception is under pressure. Our hedge fund business actually grew this quarter, so we saw growth both with respect to KKR Prisma and also across our strategic partnerships, in particular Marshall Wace, which has continued to scale its assets. So, what we're seeing is that, while there is this broad perception of the industry being under pressure, the big we think are getting bigger, and if you look at the hedge fund industry as a whole, the assets have actually increased, so there's more of a concentration on the large end and we're getting a little bit of a benefit of that.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. All right, thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, good morning, everyone. There was an article in early October that suggested that you would not be launching a new growth fund in China, but would instead focus on larger buyouts. I just want to see if there's any validity to the article, because it looks like China Growth II only has $250 million left of uncalled capital. So I'm just trying to see if we should wait for Asia Fund III as your next kind of large fund in Pan Asia?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: The short answer, Craig, is that you should. We have made a decision not to launch a China Growth II fund, and concentrate our efforts on private equity in Asia through Asia III. Really the China growth vehicle that we had created we think is performing nicely, but we have seen a significant increase in competition at the smaller end of transactions in China, and have decided on a go-forward basis to focus our efforts where we think the puck is going, which is around some of the larger transactions on a go-forward basis, which will be doing out of Asia III.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, Scott. That was it for me.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Hi, this is Kaimon Chung for Glenn Schorr. So just regarding your utilization activity, there's been more secondaries on stuff that's been public and some strategic sales but no IPOs. So how much of a function is that due to like the IPO market drying up or a function of the market environment, versus just the preference for strategic sales?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Happy to take that. So, if you actually look on a year-to-date basis, I think there is always a lot of focus around whether a company has gone public. If you look year-to-date at our monetizations in private equity, over 60% of the monetizations have actually been from secondary offerings in our public portfolio companies. So we have had a lot of activity in the public markets. You're right, there have been fewer companies that have actually gone public, but we have a lot of public companies that we've been selling down. And there has been a lot of strategic activity, and oftentimes we'll look at whether we should run a dual process and consider an IPO or a strategic sale. Frankly the strategic M&A bid has been very strong, especially out of Asia, so we've seen a lot of cross-border M&A out of Japan and China which we've been selling into. So, no great trends there except to say that we've got a large public portfolio, it's about 35%, 40% of our portfolio is in public stocks on the PE front. You'll continue to see us sell those down over time, and where we can access opportunistic M&A, we'll do it.
Kaimon Chung - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, good morning. I noticed the realized performance compensation accrual, it had been running between 40% and 41% the last two-and-half years, was up over 45% this quarter. What happened there?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Chris. This is Bill. Subtle bump-up this quarter, and as you probably know, the way we compensate the KKR executives is they're entitled to 40% of the carry, and that's...
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Right.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: ... unencumbered by management fee returns to our LPs. And so typically in a private equity fund, first you return (31:14) and then you return management fees and then you would take the carry. We actually don't burden that KKR executive carry pool by that amount. And what's happened in the preferred returns that actually have had monetizations where we've been paying out cash carry, and a good amount of that happened in the third quarter of 2016, you saw an increase in that number. I will tell you that for modeling purposes, when you look at that number next quarter, it'll be probably in that 41%, 42% again.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, just don't use 45%-plus going forward?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Correct. Do not use 45% going forward, you should run it anywhere between 41% and 42%.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. And then next, on looking at your balance sheet, you raised over $1 billion of cash in the quarter. What's – why – what's it – why are you building cash? And I guess in particular in light of not having reloaded the buyback authorization, why build so much cash?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, I'll address the first, and I'll see if Scott wants another chance to address the buyback question. But why it happens is, obviously with the secondary that we exited this particular quarter in Zimmer and Walgreens, we were participants in co-invests, so we had significant cash from those monetizations. In addition, as Scott mentioned earlier, with CLO-07-1, we called that CLO a couple of quarters ago, monetizing that, and we're seeing a good amount of cash coming through from that. And so that's why you see the $2.9 billion this quarter. Obviously with the 07-1, we're in the business to continue to underwrite CLOs, certainly investing at least the amount that we need for a rich retention. And so we'll deploy some of that capital, although it won't be this quarter, in CLOs.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I'd say, Chris, it's more timing than anything else, so that we did have some monetizations in the portfolio, and some – the cash balance picked up as a result. But we've also increased our uncalled commitments for the better part of $1 billion in a relatively near term in the last few quarters. So if you kind of look out going forward, once those new commitments are drawn down, I think you'll see the cash balance come down as well.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: One other subtlety, Chris, is that, as you may have seen, we announced that we're going to be taking out a senior note – excuse me, in KFN at roughly $260 million this quarter, and that will happen on November 15. So you will see, just by default, the cash number go down by that approximately $260 million.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks, good morning. Just maybe starting, there was a press article a few weeks ago essentially saying the firm is going into a legal process with one of the investment companies. And I'm not looking for any specific detail on that investment, but just love some kind of thoughts around how you think about the internal process for assessing situations where maybe there are some red flags that are not in the numbers. And then, also kind of the marks when there appears to be kind of a binary outcome, it's a legal case or something like that, how do you think about valuation in those situations?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Devin, it's Scott. So I think you're probably referring to Aceco, which is an investment that we have in South America. And I think that the short answer on that – and it's hard to generalize more broadly – the short answer on that is that investment was written off a few quarters ago. So nothing to worry about in terms of impact on a go-forward basis; that's part of the NAXI fund, which is performing very well as you can see in the numbers. So we're not going to be able to talk about the investment in more detail, given the pending litigation, but just broadly speaking, I would not worry about it in terms of further impact on the financial statements.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Okay, that's what I was looking for. Thank you. And then, with respect to CLOs, you touched on upcoming risk retention. It seems that we're hearing more about firms, they're looking at some new strategies, even kind of off-balance sheet structures to reduce the capital burden. So, just curious if you've any updated thoughts there, or you may look to do some other things to kind of reduce the amount of capital you need to hold?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, nothing to share with you today. We are looking at the same things as you are in terms of different approaches around risk retention. I think the approach we've taken in the past is the overall ROE of that business is very attractive for us, even without some of those strategies, which if we were to go down that path, would just further increase the ROE. So, we're looking at it, but nothing more to share with you today than that.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Got it. Okay, thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, good morning, guys. Bill, can you just run through the management fee calculation again? I think you were talking about NAXI XII potentially contributing, I think you said $95 million, and then with NAXI XI when that runs off, I didn't quite get what the contra to that would be? And then on slide five of that $250 million to then run rate in NAXI XII, would we be up to that, pretty close to that $250 million run rate in 2018?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Sure. I'll break it down into the two parts that you asked. My point was, with regard to NAXI going from the investment period to the post-investment period and then Americas XII coming on, you would see an increase in the management fees of an additional $95 million, not $95 million attributable just to Americas XII.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And you know, the way our funds work is that you collect typically 1.5% during the investment period and 75 basis points in the post-investment period. And so, one fund turning off and one fund turning on, and that fund being approximately $4 billion larger than the NAXI fund, is going to generate that additional revenue.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay, that's clear. And then at the $250 million run rate, do you expect you'd be sort of up to that in 2018? Or is it little bit longer?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Well, when you look at the supplement, you could see that 53% of what we're talking about is coming from Americas XII. And so, once that actually turns on – and whether or not that'd be in the first quarter or second quarter 2017, we're not going to predict – but that will generate fee income from Americas XII. The remaining 47%, remember, it's all long-dated locked-up capital that the fee is in excess of 1.2%, and traditionally, depending on what strategy is behind that 47%, it could be Special Sits II or Direct Lending III or II, it will actually be turned on over probably the next two to two-and-a-half, three years.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: I think that's fair. If you look at that 47%, I think the only additional color I give is that a lot of the strategies that are in there are strategies where it's a Fund II, Fund III type dynamic, where the funds that are coming online are much larger than the funds that might be getting liquidated.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: So – over this period of time. So I think a nice net lift for the management fees from that piece of it as well.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: And I – we're referring to page five on the supplement. I mean, the really good news about this is that the blended fee rate is above that 1.2% and its very locked-up capital.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Right. Okay, no that's great color and I appreciate that. And then just this follow-up question on, maybe Scott if you could talk a little bit about deployment opportunities for Americas XII as you get past XI, and also how much you might be leaving in XI for follow-ons as well?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Okay. In terms of leaving in XI for follow-ons, I think it's going to be probably closer to the typical approach that we take in terms of the reserve. So call it rough justice, 10%-ish, give or take.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Right. Might be a little lower, but 7.5% to 10%, is good enough.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: And in terms of the deal environment, I'd say in the U.S., to answer your question, this has been a really busy year, if you think about it. So there's been a, quite a bit of deal flow this year, Epicor, UFC, RES. We just announced another retail deal. So, we've been taking advantage of investment opportunities where we find them, more idiosyncratic. And at the same time, as you heard, we're exiting, given the strength of the equity and debt market. So the volatility we've seen this year has led to some interesting opportunities. We're finding different markets are bifurcated, you've got some companies that are valued very well and some less well. The market really likes simplicity, and we largely get paid to assess and understand and invest in complexity, and we're finding complexity is pretty cheap right now. So, good deployment opportunities through the course of this year, and has us optimistic about the opportunity set for Americas XII as well.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It sounds like you could be more aggressive on the deployment pace in this type of environment before maybe things get too frothy, or more patient longer-term?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Look, I think it's hard to give you a blanket statement. I mean, our job is to figure out how to monetize the environment, and where we can you've seen us be aggressively selling down some of our public positions. We've been accessing the M&A environment, we've been accessing the financing markets through dividend deals. But also we've found some pretty interesting investment opportunities, you just got to look a little bit, a little bit harder. The valuations have been very high in some instances, which has caused us to back away, but we've managed to find some opportunities that we really like, where we think we can make the businesses better operationally. And so that's where you've seen us deploy. So hard to give you a blanket statement, it's a little more complicated than that, but we're seeing both deployment and exit opportunities.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's great, that's great color. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Rob, you there?
Ann Dai - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. This is Ann calling in for Rob.
Craig Larson - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Ann.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Hi, Ann.
Ann Dai - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: How are you doing? Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to clarify some of the comments around fundraising and maybe what's coming up, and just make sure that we haven't missed anything. So it seems like earlier you spoke about Direct Lending III coming to the market maybe at some point, having a new Asia fund on the way. I think I saw some reports that maybe a small healthcare fund, and obviously NAXI's substantially underway on its fundraising. So is there anything big that we're missing here, and any other comments around what we might expect to see?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: No, I don't think you're missing much. Americas XII is – should be wrapping up relatively soon. We still expect that fund in aggregate to be over $13 billion in size, including our capital. You mentioned healthcare growth, we're also in the market with a technology growth fund that we should be wrapping up fundraising for in the relatively near term. We have a second real estate opportunistic fund, REPA II is in the market; our second Mezz fund, which we're calling PCOP, or Private Credit Opportunities II, is in the market. And you're right on direct lending in Asia. The only other thing I'd point you to is real estate credit, where we're raising capital around those strategies, both in longer-term more permanent format and temporary fund format.
Ann Dai - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much.
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dive in a little bit on the balance sheet with Americas XII, looks like you're committing over 8% to that fund. Probably like closer to 7% when it's all and done, but it's meaningfully higher than the predecessor funds, which are more in the 3% range. So I guess just, how are you thinking about rationale for putting such a large check (44:06) on a fund for a very well-established strategy, and how do you think about balancing – putting such a large amount in a single fund, versus seeding other, newer strategies? Some may kind of push back and take the view that there's a lack of attractive opportunities out there, and so you put it into a larger fund here. But just curious, maybe why not buy back more stock if that's the case?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Mike, this is Bill. As Scott mentioned earlier, when you look at the balance sheet and the asset allocations for private equity, we're targeting anywhere in that 40%, 45% range. And as we've been monetizing a lot of the co-investments, like a Zimmer, like a Walgreens, in order to make sure we capture that asset allocation, we're going to have to be making bigger commitments to invest side-by-side with our funds, because in a lot of cases, when we make an equity investment, there is no discretionary allocation that the balance sheet may or may not be entitled to. So, we're just increasing that amount, and you shouldn't really look at it as far as percentage, you should also look at it as applicable to the size of the number, because we continue to do our job and there's performance there, we're going to continue to grow and compound that balance sheet, and that number over a much larger number is going to be a lower percentage.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. So, you're thinking about it more from an asset allocation perspective?
Scott C. Nuttall - KKR & Co. LP: Correct. Yeah, I think that's right. I think the – look, if you look at the NAXI fund, it's 25% – it's still a relatively young fund and it's 25% IRR, inception to date. So yeah, we think that it's helpful in terms of raising capital from third parties as we are big investors in everything that we do and we like to make sure that we're eating our own cooking in a big way. But frankly, when you also cut through it, we think it's a very attractive return opportunity. And to Bill's point, we're focused on keeping our asset allocation in the appropriate range.
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: The underlying fund will be highly diversified, as they always are. So we think it's a good way to get more exposure to our private equity business.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. If I could just ask a follow-up quickly there, just on the credit side, certainly as the balance sheet asset allocation shifts towards PE away from credit, it sounds like that suggests that interest income could come down, which today helps support the dividend. So just curious how you're thinking about growing a more recurring fee and yield income? You've done Marshall Wace and KFN historically. What strategic actions could you take to accelerate the fee and yield income growth? What's the appetite for that today?
William Joseph Janetschek - KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Look, I think a couple of things. One, if you look at the places that we generate the more recurring portions of our cash flow, a huge portion of it is our fee-related earnings. And so a big portion of what we're focused on day-to-day is scaling these newer businesses that we've created over the last 5 to 10 years. And page five of the supplemental deck tries to get some of that across, but we see a big opportunity to continue to grow our management fee line and get leverage over the expenses that sometimes – for these businesses oftentimes you add before the revenue shows up. So I think a big part to answer your question is just continue to get the management fee line growing and get leverage over that expense base and continue to grow our fee-related earnings as we kind of deploy the balance sheet more broadly across our asset allocation model. I think this move out of credit more into private equity and real assets has been more one-time. We were overweighed credit post the KFN combination, and so you're really just being us move to our longer-term asset allocation approach. So as you've seen, we've got the interest and dividends coming down purposefully as part of that, but we've got plenty of coverage of the dividend and you'll continue to see us kind of grow our AUM and be thoughtful strategically where we see opportunities. Nothing near-term on the strategic front that we'd point to.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the KKR Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tanya. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, which is available on the Investor Center section of kkr.com. This call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And like previous quarters, we've also posted a supplementary presentation to our website, which we'll be referring to a number of times over the course of the call. This morning, we reported our second quarter results. Of note, we reported second quarter economic net income of $249 million, which equates to $0.23 of after-tax economic net income per unit and after-tax total distributable earnings of $508 million. We've again announced our $0.16 per unit distribution and on the buyback front. In total over the almost nine months since we announced our $500 million authorization, we repurchased and cancelled 33.9 million units and have about $60 million remaining under the authorization. And when we look at our payout ratio over these last three quarters, so looking at our distributions together with the buyback activity, our payout ratio actually exceeds 100% over this timeframe. If you can turn to page two of the presentation, the page highlights the main themes in our business that we'll be expanding on over the next 15 or 20 minutes. First, this was a strong distributable earnings quarter given our monetization activity. And as noted on the page, the $508 million figure is the third-highest distributable earnings quarter we've had as a public company. Second, we continue to have success from a fundraising standpoint. Our AUM has increased 14% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the $34 billion of gross inflows over this period. And finally, we believe we are exceptionally well-positioned in this market environment. Fundamentally, having more dry powder than we've had at any point in our history to invest behind our ideas during volatile markets will be, we believe, a very good thing for our firm over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Craig. To set the stage for our results, I'll start with our performance. As you can see on page three of our supplement, we had strong investment performance both on a quarterly and year-to-date basis across our carry-paying funds. Year-to-date, our three key flagship PE funds – NAXI, Asia II and Europe III – outperformed relative benchmarks by 200 basis points to 1,900 basis points. Overall, our private equity portfolio was up 4.5% in the quarter with the private portfolio contributing 6% growth and public security contributing 3%. Within real assets, our Real Estate and Infrastructure Funds continue to perform and EIGF was up 10% in the quarter as underlying commodity prices rebounded. Shifting to Alternative Credit, our benchmark Special Sits and Mezz funds trailed both credit indices in the quarter, while Lending Partners II continued to perform. Focusing on total segment financials, management, monitoring and transaction fees were $262 million, with management fees exceeding $200 million in the quarter for the first time. Year-over-year, management fees were up 12%, reflecting our fee-paying AUM growth. Performance income in the quarter was $329 million, up significantly over last quarter. Strong unrealized marks coupled with the pronounced level of realization activity across a large number of our portfolio of investments were the key contributors to this increase. Page four highlights our realization activity. In total, realization event at 10 portfolio companies drove a 200% increase in cash carry compared to last quarter. On a blended basis, these exits were done at 3.2 times our cost, an IRR of 19% and were diversified across geographies and type of exits. Shifting to investment income, we had a strong realization quarter driven primarily by a few of the same names that contributed to carry. Exits in Walgreens and HCA in particular drove the realized gain, given our sizable co-investment and fund exposure in these companies. And turning to the expense side, cash compensation and benefits and other expenses were down modestly compared to Q2 2015. Bringing it all together, fee-related earnings came in at $138 million. Our after-tax distributable earnings were $508 million, with reported pre-tax ENI of $201 million and after-tax ENI of $191 million. Moving on to AUM and fee-paying AUM, page five of the supplement highlights the growth in AUM over the last 12 months. Our AUM has increased 14% over this period to $131 billion. This growth was primarily driven by $28 billion of organic capital raised during this time period. The quality of the capital that we were raising is quite strong. Looking at this $28 billion, on a blended basis, roughly 80% is carry or incentive fee-eligible and locked up for at least eight years from inception. Also of note, the $131 billion includes roughly $20 billion of assets where we are not yet earning economics. So we haven't seen any impact in our management fees. Fee-paying AUM has also grown nicely and is up 9% over the same time period. In the quarter, AUM increased by $5 billion behind continued fundraising activity in private and public markets. Net inflows in private equity, real estate, CLOs, our strategic partnerships and a few of our liquid credit mandates were the big contributors. Fee-paying AUM increased $1 billion in the quarter despite our robust monetization activity. This leaves us with approximately $38 billion of dry powder as of June 30th, a 48% increase year-over-year. Moving on to deployment, we invested $1 billion of capital in Private Markets. The largest contributors were private equity investment in the Swedish flooring business out of E4 and an infrastructure JV formed with Pemex, (07:52). In public markets, deployment was $1.1 billion, up nicely from last quarter. And looking forward, we have a nice pipeline of activity slated for the second half of the year. There are two additional items I'd like to touch on. The first relates to Brexit and our exposure to the UK. In June, the vote to withdraw from the EU triggered a global sell-off in equities, while the pound suffered its biggest fall in history and hit a 31-year low. While the full implications of the vote and its longer term impact on markets remain to be seen and will play out over the coming years, let's run through our exposures. First, on a fair value exposure to the UK, it's quite modest. When looking at our global private equity portfolio, less than 2% of current fair value stems from portfolio companies which drive the majority of their revenues in or from the UK. In terms of real estate and direct lending, while we do have exposure to the UK investments, their exposure to the firm is immaterial. And in terms of currency at both the fund and portfolio company level, as we've historically done, we proactively hedged our currency exposure. So, the impact from the movement of the pound at the end of the quarter was quite modest. Finally, I'd like to turn to balance sheet. Our activity this quarter has been focused on increasing our liquidity. Given the volatility we've seen and expect to continue to see, we wanted to enhance our liquidity to position ourselves to take advantage of dislocations and we have made a good amount of progress in the quarter. Driven by monetization activity in the quarter and a second perpetual preferred stock offering, our cash and short-term investments have increased from $1.5 billion at the end of last quarter to $1.9 billion. In addition to this, we completed two transactions this quarter worth spending a minute on. Through these transactions, we sold pools of assets from the balance sheet, a combination of private equity and alternative credit co-investments, growth equity investments, as well as CLO equity to two separately managed accounts. In return, we received cash, continued participation in the significant portion of the upside of these investments, and new LP commitments within our growth equity strategies. We basically look at these transactions and think. We sold 85% on the assets in these pools while retaining a significant portion of the upside in the assets that we sold. We received cash, which we will invest back into the firm, and we helped to solidify fundraising efforts with some of the new Fund Is, which will help enhance our AUM, fee-paying AUM, management fees and with performance, the carry line. These transactions are another example of how we can utilize the balance sheet to help grow the firm's profits. Specifically, in terms of the balance sheet as of June 30, the proceeds from these transactions, approximately $400 million in total, will positively impact our cash balances later this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill, and thanks everybody for joining our call. I'm going to take a bit of a different approach this quarter. As most of you are aware, our firm and our model are different. Specifically, we have a long-term locked-up capital not subject to redemption. Over 70% of our management fees come from capital that's locked up for at least eight years from inception, and we have a balance sheet with over $13 billion of assets. Because of this dynamic, we operate and invest with a different view, a longer term view. While most of the Street operates in increments of 90 days or less, our frame of reference and timeline in measuring performance is much longer. Given this, I sometimes find we talk past each other. We all invest, but our timeframes and perspectives are quite different. Over the last 12 months, it has felt as though market sentiment has played an increasingly important role in how our units trade in the public markets, and this sentiment has felt to us very short-term-oriented in nature. So this quarter, rather than run through what was marked up or down, we thought we would try reviewing our performance in a different way, by walking through a few of the more prevalent perceptions, questions, and concerns that we hear from you and how they relate to the performance of the firm. We've outlined each of these in our supplemental deck. So I'm going to start with the first one on page six, and we hear this one quite often. Perception 1: In volatile market environments, KKR won't be able to monetize investments and generate cash. As Bill discussed, exit activity has actually been robust and helped drive our over $500 million of distributable earnings this quarter. In fact, this quarter is the third-highest level of after-tax distributable earnings the firm has ever generated and excludes four sizable portfolio company strategic sales, which have been announced and are expected to close in the second half of the year. Slide seven shows some details behind this activity. Even in periods of market volatility, we're able to access strategic buyers and pursue public offerings across our portfolio and across geographies. Our public holdings continue to account for a healthy portion of total PE fair value, 40% or so as of June 30, despite sizable secondaries at some of our larger public companies during the quarter. This figure now includes US Foods, which successfully priced its IPO in Q2. Given our large portfolio of public holdings and the continuing strong strategic bid for assets, we've got good visibility on exits and carry generation. Let's turn to Perception 2. Here's another one we hear. With markets near all-time highs, KKR won't be able to deploy meaningful capital within Private Markets. Now, please turn to page nine. Two thoughts here. First, on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that while the S&P 500 may be up 4% in the last 12 months, it's certainly not reflective of performance across most global indices in the last year. Many Asian and European equity markets are in the midst of a bear market, with indices in Japan and China all declining more than 20%. Many European indices have declined as well, between 10% and 20% over this timeframe. And in the U.S., we've seen a divergence between small cap and large cap companies, with the Russell 2000 underperforming both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 by over 700 basis points. As we've said before, this type of backdrop is great for us. With patient capital and the added benefit of $38 billion of record dry powder, we feel well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise from this dislocation. In effect, when you have locked-up (15:44) capital and a lot of dry powder to deploy, it's great news when assets get cheaper. In addition, as the right-hand side of the page highlights, we've been actively deploying capital into this dislocation and have announced several pending transactions expected to close later this year. Our pipelines are full and our activity levels increasing. So, let's go to Perception 3, which we also hear quite frequently. Given volatility, your private equity returns are under pressure. And I'm on page 11. As you can see, inception-to-date returns have been very strong, meaningfully outperforming the public markets, which bodes well for future distributable earnings and fundraising. Outperformance in the private equity asset class is greatest in periods of time when the public markets are returning less than 10%. This is what we've been seeing in the market and expect to continue to see. Let's turn to Perception 4; I'm now on slide 12. Given the current economic backdrop, revenue growth will be hard to come by in the coming years. Page 13 shows the growth in our management fee profile since 2010. In the last five or so years, we see this figure increase at an annual rate of about 11%. Important to note here, the $775 million in management fees generated in the last 12 months excludes the impact of $20 billion of capital not yet earning fees which we'll turn on over time. If all of that was invested today at its blended fee rate of 131 basis points and we assume Americas XII reaches its hard cap, this would translate into $214 million in net incremental management fees per year. This is equivalent to about 30% of our annual management fees. To be clear, as the $20 billion gets invested, some of the $775 million will run off, but we expect this dynamic to have a significant net impact on fee income over time. Fee pressure is another topic that comes up in every recent investor meeting. On that, I'll point you to the smaller chart on the same page, which uses Americas XII as an example. When Americas XII turns on and we continue to realize fees from NAXI post-investment period, this will result in a net fee step-up of over 80% across these two vehicles. And in looking at the totality of Americas XII's economics we've retained, if not improved on, the blended economic profile on a pool of capital that should end up 40% larger than its predecessor fund. Given the success we've had in our fundraising and the significance of Shadow AUM, we've never had greater visibility on management fee growth than we have today. If you go to page 14, you'll see the net growth across each of our major strategies since 2010. In each case, we've either launched or expanded our presence across these asset classes and believe with continued performance, we have the opportunity to scale further from here. Switching gears and turning to Perception 5. Since the change in your distribution policy, you've returned less to unit holders. We've fielded numerous questions on what we've been doing with our retained after-tax distributable earnings since announcing a fixed distribution back in October. Since we haven't returned nearly as much as cash as we would have under a variable policy, where has it gone? Well, on page 16, you'll see that the opposite actually holds true. We've returned more capital to shareholders in the last three quarters than we would have under our old policy. $0.48 in distributions coupled with $484 million in share buybacks has translated into a payout ratio of over 100% of distributable earnings. In effect since October, we've used more than 100% of our cash flow for dividends and buybacks. We feel good with the progress we've made on this front. Our share count has come down even with the issuance of units in connection with the Marshall Wace transaction. Looking forward, we expect to retain a meaningful portion of our cash flow to invest back into the firm, ensure we have the flexibility to invest behind and support our ideas and growth initiatives. Finally, I'd like to draw your attention to Perception number 6. Given the way your units have traded, your business must be facing headwinds. The last 12 months have been a volatile period and from a shareholder return perspective, none of us at KKR are pleased with the performance of our unit over this timeframe. If you would turn your attention to slide 18, you'll see a list of fundamentals which we track closely and the growth we've experienced since last June. As you can see on the slide, dry powder is up 48%, AUM is up 14%, fee-paying AUM is up 9% and our LP base has grown by 8% with over 70 new LPs in total. These metrics are driven by the progress we've made fundraising highlighted on the right-hand side of the page. Our LTM new capital raised of $28 billion is the highest figure we reported in any 12-month period and is quite broad based across strategies. While these are just a few broad steps to highlight, from our seats, this dynamic feels very good particularly given our longer term wins. In essence, we feel our model is performing well. And when we walk the halls and take employees' temperatures on their outlook for the trajectory of the firm, reactions and opinions are very positive and tend to send around three simple but powerful themes: we're well-positioned for growth, our differentiated model allows us to be entrepreneurial and nimble when others can't be, and the opportunity set that lies ahead is an exciting one. We continue to believe that market volatility is great for us and similarly believe that over the long term, public market sentiment and the price of our units will catch up with the positive fundamentals we see across our firm. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: And Tanya, before we turn it directly over to you, if we could ask everyone just to please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up. We do have quite a long list of folks on the queue. And with that, we're ready for questions, Tanya.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open, Glenn.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks. Not sure if I missed it, but you noted all those post-2Q monetization activity. Did you mention the distributable earnings associated with it?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: What we did highlight is based upon those transactions and assuming that they all do close, that is going to drive roughly about $250 million of distributable earnings in the second half of 2016.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. Awesome. Thanks. And the other one was I wanted a little more color on your comments about the debt and preferred issuances. You mentioned wanting greater liquidity and flexibility. You seem to have a lot. So maybe expand on that or maybe just help us think through where you draw the line of how much is an offer. Is this just an ongoing you'll build it and you want to keep a cap, let's say, $1 billion of pure liquidity?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Well, Glenn, it's going to ebb and flow. As I mentioned, we started the quarter at $1.5 billion. We had nice monetizations and so that's $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we did take the opportunity to top up that perpetual preferred. We originally did something of $355 million and we added another one $145 million to get that up to the $500 million. We like liquidity in this type of environment. And to the extent that there's going to be dislocations, we want to have the ability to have that cash to exit on those types of opportunities. Keep in mind, the cash is probably one of the best hedges you could possibly have. And so, I wouldn't say that we're going to continue to grow that dollar amount continually, but keep in mind that as we sell investments and redeploy that capital back into our balance sheet, we do expect the balance sheet to grow over time. And so, cash as a percentage of that total by just default will continue to grow.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The only other thing I'd mention, Glenn, is that if you look at the press release, you see actually the uncalled commitments we have to our underlying fund has actually doubled over the last year or so. They're about $2.6 billion now. So, we also keep an eye on that as we think about how much liquidity to have.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: All right. That's fair. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ken Hill of Barclays. Your line is open.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to kind of hone in on energy here. I think last quarter, it was a pretty decent drag and this quarter, it seemed to be pretty good. So wondering kind of if you can provide some updates on how that's progressing in 3Q. And then just thinking about that exposure longer term, I mean it's not a small exposure for you now, but there seem to be a lot of interesting opportunities in the market. So, wondering if you could maybe speak to those opportunities and how you're thinking about the concentration there longer term.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Ken. This is Bill Janetschek. At a high-level energy, when you think about what that impact was on the balance sheet this quarter, it drove about $40 million of earnings. One thing we could call out is if you take a look at page 11, we actually disclosed one of our oil and gas investments and you could see that that was up roughly about 12%. This quarter, roughly $70 million. And obviously, with the rebound in commodity prices and especially how we model our investments, if you go out to where the two- and three-year forward curve was, that was up about 15%. And so, you would imagine that you could see that come through our P&L to the extent that we had that rebound in the commodity price. You are right. When you look at the balance sheet, we do have a good amount of exposure. But when you look at that total over the total size of our balance sheet portfolio, we're pretty comfortable from an asset allocation percentage to the amount that we've got in energy right now.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: I'll just point to a couple other stats. Energy is about less than 2% of our global private equity portfolio, less than 4% in credit and direct energy anyway is less than 6% of the balance sheet. So on a relative to indices basis, we're actually underexposed. We did have very good quarter in Q2 and we saw some of the marks we took in Q1 bounce back pretty materially. We do have dry powder in our Energy Income & Growth Fund and we're looking for opportunities. To date, we've found a couple of things to do, but we continue to be patient as some of the opportunities actually seem to be reflecting ahead of the forward curve. And so, we're waiting for things to come back. There's a bit more, but we've got capital to be opportunistic when we see something we like.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Just to give you a number on that because Scott's right, we do have a good amount of dry powder. That number on the energy platform is in excess of $2 billion.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the color there. The other thing I like was the UK commentary earlier on the call. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about that. In Europe, more generally, I think last quarter, you guys talked about good long-term performance in private equity but also areas like credit, real estate, infrastructure. Wondering if any of those look more appetizing, I guess, now post Brexit?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I think there are a lot of interesting opportunities across Europe. I would expect UK activity to be down. In UK specifically, we're going to be cautious. We frankly don't think that valuations have come down to reflect the uncertainty in the market. There's clearly more political uncertainty in Europe, but we are finding more opportunities as we discuss last quarter to work with the banks, as an example, to help them with some of the assets that they have on their balance sheet. We think that's a big opportunity for us. We're spending time in real estate. We see opportunities in private equity on the continent in particular, so there's a significant amount of opportunity in Europe despite the market uncertainty and the political uncertainty. We're just watching valuations. It seems like valuations are a bit high so we're going to be patient. We've got a lot of dry powder to move quickly when we see something that we like.
Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Scott, a follow-up to your comment around expectation to keep a more meaningful portion of your deal on balance sheet going forward, should we think about kind of the payout that we've seen over the course of this quarter, so something a little south to 40% as a decent run rate as we think about the buyback going forward?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. I'm not sure I'm going to point you to the specific payout ratio on a go-forward basis, Alex. I guess let me tell you how we think about it, and appreciate the question. But if we revisit the history a little bit, last October when we announced the change in the distribution policy, we announced this $500 million authorization. We said you should expect us to use that likely over the course of 12 months. We've used about 90% in about nine months. We also said that we would be using buybacks to offset dilution and control our share count. Since that period of time, the share counts actually come down even though we used some shares for the Marshall Wace transaction. So, I would tell you that the fact that we used over 100% of our distributable earnings in the last nine months for dividends and buybacks, I would not expect that to be the norm. What I would point you to is that the statement we've made and we'll remake now is that you should expect us to control our share count over time. And so, as you model out the share count, I would just keep it flat over time. It doesn't mean we're going to be active in every period. We're not going to forecast payouts, but I think that's the best way to reflect it in your models.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thanks for that. And then a question for you guys around the credit business with respect to the balance sheet. So, if we look at the balances quarter-over-quarter, down a little bit kind of across a number of different buckets, some of the Special Situations, some of the CLOs. Any color especially in light of generally pretty benign – it looks like environment in the second quarter for credit strategies with pay yield generally rallying and some of your peers are taking a pretty meaningful positive marks there? So, just kind of trying to get a little more color whether some of that was a transfer to old balance sheet or a sale or what kind of the underlying credits have done in that portfolio?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I wouldn't look at the balances because I think that could be misleading because we've actually been monetizing some of that portfolio in particular, the CLO equity portfolio. So, credit actually had a very nice quarter. CLOs were up over 4% in the quarter. Credit overall on the balance sheet was up 2.2% in the quarter. So, you need to adjust for the fact you're seeing realizations move those balances around a little bit. So I'd say it was a very nice quarter reflective of kind of the broader underlying markets and how we manage the portfolios.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. So more sale acuity (32:49). Got it. Cool. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. Hey, guys. The $400 million sale of assets off the balance sheet to separate accounts, I didn't quite follow that. Did that happened post Q2? I guess for the first part of the question. And then, the second part of the question is maybe you guys could talk a little bit about strategically the thought process behind that and whether it's the start of a process perhaps to simplify your balance sheet in a more significant way.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Chris, this is Bill. The transaction itself did takes place by the close of Q2. However, the proceeds weren't received by the end of Q2. And so that's why I alluded to the fact that you'll see approximately $400 million come in, in the second half of the year. And the way to think about this is, is we had assets on our balance sheet and we were fortunate enough to enter into two transactions with two separate parties, where they wanted a preferred return. But to the extent that we beat that preferred return, they were willing to give us significant profit participation above that preferred return. So, the way we look at it, we sold roughly 85% of the assets that we had on the balance sheet and some of those assets, as I mentioned, it was in private equity; it was in credit. As we've started to ramp up our growth strategy, and that would be in technology and in healthcare, we had actually invested a good amount on the balance sheet. When we had two investors that were willing to participate in those strategies, it seemed like a win-win for them and for us. And again, roughly 85% of the assets got sold with significant participation on the upside to the extent that we have performance. And I would think that as we have the balance sheet that we have and we will continue to use it strategically as we add additional assets and we come across investors who want to participate in those assets and we can work out economic arrangements that are good for them and us, we'll continue to do this.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The second part to your question, Chris, here's how I think about it. We've said in the past and we really believe the balance sheet is a true strategic weapon for us, and the way we've used it has evolved. So, initially, it started feeding new strategies and that's how we built a number of these new businesses over the last five or six years. And we talked in the past about this dropdown strategy where we would do investment on balance sheet, drop those into a fund as kind of next piece of technology. I would say transactions like this are just the continuing evolution of how we used the balance sheet. So what we really did was to take assets on balance sheet, raise liquidity but keep a lot of upside. So, in effect, converted those to more asset management-like assets with a very high incremental carry while also raising new capital for some of our newer strategies. So we think the ROE on that type of transaction for us is very high. In terms of where we're going with the balance sheet, look, if you think about it, when we did the merger with KPE, we were an all-PE balance sheet basically. And then we've been converting that balance sheet to get more liquid, using that to seed new strategies. Then we did KFN. We've been liquidating some of those assets and redeploying those into higher-returning opportunities. And I would expect that you'll continue to see us evolve the balance sheet strategy. It probably will get a bit simpler, you'll see we made a big commitment, for example, to the Americas XII Fund as an example, so you'll see more in our funds. And we'll keep you updated as we continue to use the balance sheet to seed some of these newer ideas and also create more asset management-type flows for us using the balance sheet as seed.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: And, Chris, one more follow-up on this. It was not only a balance sheet play to the extent that there was one particular investment that was interested in healthcare and technology. In addition to transacting with us based on the balance sheet asset, they also made a primary commitment to that strategy on a go-forward basis. So it's a way for us to raise additional AUM lock-step with selling those assets.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citi. Your line is open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much. Just coming back to capital management and maybe free cash flow priorities, I mean as you look at over the next 12 months, I know you sort of hedged a little bit in terms of the go-forward payout. But how do you sort of work through where your stock is trading right now against the very strong fundamentals and sort of the perception issues that you called out in your prepared remarks versus redeployment into other businesses? And I guess the ultimate question here is why wouldn't you be buying back a ton of stock at these levels? What's the holdback here?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the question, Bill. Look, I think – I'm not going to revisit some of the topics that I hit before. I guess from my perspective, the buyback conversation has really taken on a bit of a life of its own and I find that we're talking more about buybacks than we are about our business and how we can grow and where we see opportunity from here. So, I think that's why we're pointing you to the comment, we're not going to predict this, model our share count flat, that's what you should expect on a go-forward basis from us over time, and we're going to leave it at that for now. We clearly see opportunities. We've talked about all the different opportunities we see in the market to invest for return. You've seen the commitments we've made to our underlying funds; we want to keep liquidity for that. But over the long term, just expect our share count flat and we'll keep you updated on our performance on the balance sheet and in our funds.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for that. So then a related question then would be, is there any thought to revisit the fixed nature of the dividend, distribution, excuse me?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: No change. I think if you go back to the earnings call we had last October where we announced this change in policy, we said fixed distribution, which we're underwriting over time, that could go up based on our earnings trajectory of the firm and we're going to use the capital we retain for buybacks and to invest more in what we do every day. And that's really what we've been doing. It's been heavier on the buyback for the last nine months. I think over time, you'll see it balance out more, but really no change from what we said last October.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for taking my questions, Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Brian.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, folks. And thanks for all the extra disclosure in the presentation. It's really, really good. The first question is just on the timing of the $20 billion of commitments that are not yet earning fees. You gave some good disclosure on the NAXI, but maybe just a little bit more color on sort of the timeline of when you think that might turn on. And I realize it does depend on deployment.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, and you're spot on. It all depends on deployment. And when we're talking about NAXI and Americas XII, we're about, say, 75% invested in NAXI. And so, once NAXI goes from the investment period to the post-investment period, that is when we would turn on $10.5 billion of that $20 billion and you would expect that to be invested over a period of anywhere in between three and five years. As it relates to the other $10-plus billion, a lot of that is raised but has yet to be invested in the products like Special Sits II and Direct Lending II. And so, we expect the time horizon of that capital, which we have and will go from AUM to fee-paying AUM, to take place over the next two or three years.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay. And then, just maybe the fundraising has been very strong in the first half of this year. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about what's the plan for the second half of the year from a fundraising perspective.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Brian. There's a lot of different things going on. So, we have several funds in the market still from kind of the more episodic funds. So Americas XII, you should expect to wrap up here in the second half. We're still in the market with our second real estate opportunistic fund, our second mezzanine fund which we call Private Credit Opportunities, growth equity in the technology space, various things going on in real estate credit. And then coming down the pipe, we've got global Direct Lending III and then at some point, Asia III. And you saw on the slide the very strong performance we've had in our Asia private equity platform. So a lot of things in market, a number coming. We've also got a number of things going on on the more continuously raised side of things, including our hedge fund strategies and our strategic partnership with Marshall Wace and with Nephila. And then on the leveraged credit front, a lot happening – high-yield leveraged loans, CLOs, separate accounts – so a pretty continuous process across multiple different strategies and geographies.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Just – I mean the pace has been strong in the first half. We should expect that to just moderate from the very robust pace in the second half, I would think, right?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I think if you look at the last 12 months, it's been pretty equal between private market and public market, $13 billion, $14 billion each. There is some lumpiness, as you know, in the private market side in particular. So, I would expect that number is probably a bit elevated due to the Americas XII raise. But as Asia III rolls on hopefully that we can raise significant capital there as well. But I'd say it's probably a little elevated because of Americas XII. Everything else I'd say is relatively normal course.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I guess just coming back to the slide deck here, performance of the major industry indices outside the U.S. is obviously challenging. Touched on the UK and Europe a bit. In Asia, which – the indices have been the hardest hit, maybe from a higher starting point, I'm just trying to get some perspective around whether you feel a sense of urgency over there just given that markets are off quite a bit. Do you capital deploy to take advantage or is it more just a mean reversion in valuations so we shouldn't really expect a big acceleration there?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Oh, it's hard to predict deployment, but I will tell you that one of the reasons we're so upbeat about the Asia platform is the performance that we've seen. You can see on slide 11 how the Asia II private equity fund, as an example, has performed relative to the MSCI Asia Pacific, so 2,600 basis points of our performance net. So what we're finding is we're seeing opportunities in private equity that really don't show up in the public markets. These are a lot of times growth equity opportunities, non-core subsidiary sales, and so we do see opportunities there. Hopefully, the valuation backdrop in the public markets will bring prices down further and give us opportunities. But we've been very focused on deploying capital in Asia where we see value and that will continue to be the case. I would just say the valuation backdrop just makes it more helpful and hopefully over time can motivate more activity once it finds a level.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And then with respect to the $0.16 quarterly distribution today against that context of $20 billion of the capital commitments not earning fees yet and obviously the commentary around the visibility there in the management fees, I mean should we think about the timing of the stair step higher in the distribution really coming on if the fees are turned on just kind of in conjunction? Or is this something that you'll evaluate at the end of the year and then think through kind of what the distribution should be?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: It's more of the latter, Devin. It's something that we're going to evaluate over time. I think we're kind of thinking a bit more in a traditional corporate context and keeping an eye on any potential pass-through tax liability we're sending through our individual shareholders. So, we'll revisit that more or less annually and keep you updated.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Got it. Also thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I just want to circle back on Asia II. The fund is performing really well, especially relative public markets. And I just want to see what you'd characterize as the key investing themes that have benefited your portfolio of companies, maybe differentiate that from some of the things we're seeing from the U.S. investments.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. So, I'd say a few different things going on. One is that it's – as I mentioned a minute ago, I think looking at the public market, especially in places like China, really what you've got is a lot of SOE, state-owned enterprise-type companies that it's not really where we spend our time. I'd say one big theme has been for us investing in growth companies that are basically exposed to the growth of the middle class and the rise of the consumer. And were finding a lot of opportunities off the beaten track. We have a big team in China where we see those opportunities. We've also been investing. Another theme would be in areas like food safety or environmental safety. We've made several investments in things like dairy farms, pork producers, chicken producers, focused on food safety. Environmental safety has also been a big theme for us in Asia and in China, in particular. If you go across the region from there, if we go to Japan, one of the things that we've liked is the opening up of Japan to the private equity-style investing in particular. A relatively recent transaction was Panasonic Healthcare, which we bought in partnership with Panasonic. They actually rolled an interest into the buyout and then we've used that as a platform to go make acquisitions on a cross-border basis. So, we bought a business from Bayer not long ago using Panasonic as a platform for that. So, that would be another example. We also bought Pioneer's DJ equipment business not long ago, similar theme in terms of finding opportunities in Japan. And increasingly, we're spending time in places like Indonesia as well where we announced a recent transaction and we've got more in the pipeline. So again, these are not deals that you're normally going to read about. They're smaller on an average basis than a lot of what we see in the U.S. There are a lot more growth; typically a lot less leverage, if any leverage; and we're helping these companies get to the next stage of development and oftentimes, ultimately, the capital markets. I hope that's a little bit of color that's helpful.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: One thing I'd add on that is when you do look at the performance of that portfolio broadly, that performance you see is very broad based. So when we look in a quarter like this, it's always nice when you see a nice percentage, a high percentage of companies that actually perform well in the quarter and they're not being reliant only on one or two specific names. The performance has been broad based.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for all the detail there. And I just have one follow-up. And you touched on this a little bit earlier, but the GP interest in Americas XII is 9.5%, which is well above sort of the other funds. I know your free cash flow generation ex the dividend is much higher now, but how do you think about how much capital to allocate in the fundraising process?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: It's a good question. Look, just to give you a sense for it, that the $1 billion or so that you see in the table there, we still expect Americas XII to hit its $12 billion hard cap. And then with the balance sheet investment plus individual investments, we expect to be over $13 billion for that fund. That will impact your percentage a little bit, but we look at it in a relatively straightforward way, which is we think that it's going to generate quite attractive returns and we'd like to have some of the balance sheet exposed to that. It's part of our strategy as a firm is to own more what we do every day. And so, as we look at our asset allocation models and where we want to take the balance sheet over time, that's how we got to that $1 billion figure. We did the same thing for every strategy that we launch and we look at it on overall ROE basis. So it's the same approach we've taken to other funds and we'll continue to on a go-forward basis.
Operator: And our next question goes to Ann Dai of KBW. Your line is open, Ann.
Ann Dai - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm calling in for Rob Lee. I was hoping to go back to fundraising and focus more specifically on hedge funds. So year-to-date performance in the aggregate has been not great broadly for hedge funds and we're continuing to see flow pressures. So would you be able to provide some color on how the environment has been for capital-raising in your own hedge fund-oriented strategies and the strategic partnerships and then any detail around performance in those strategies?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Ann. Happy to help. Look, clearly, the industry has been going through a relatively difficult time in getting a bit smaller and working hard to justify what it does. We do think that there is a real place for this in the portfolio, in particular, for managers that have a real competitive and differentiated advantage. In terms of the questions you've asked in terms of capital access, we have seen growth in the first half in our strategic partners. We don't disclose AUM or performance by partner, but in aggregate, we have seen growth in AUM both for the strategic partnerships that we have and Marshall Wace and Nephila, the two largest. And Marshall Wace by far is the largest partnership that we have. And also for Prisma, we've seen good fundraising on the growth side, which has been offset by some outflows. So, we feel like we're more than holding our own in this environment. I think that it is a period to watch out a bit for the industry. It's probably long-term healthy, and we just need to continue to perform and spend time with our clients and make sure that they understand the competitive advantage that we have. And so, that's how we're approaching it. I think it will be ultimately good for us long term. And we've been able to grow in aggregate through the course of the last six to 12 months. So, we're pleased with how we've been doing on a relative-to-the-industry basis.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: And, Ann, just to give you a little more color on that. When you take a look at AUM that we've raised over the three-month period and six-month period, when you combine our hedge fund to fund platform, which is Prisma, plus the strategic partnerships that we have like Marshall Wace, the capital we raised this quarter was in excess of $1 billion and over the last six months with $2.5 billion. So, we are seeing inflows into the space.
Ann Dai - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, Chris.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. I'm looking at page 13 of your press release where you have your fee-paying AUM roll forward. And I'm just trying to think about how the $46 billion in private equity would increase just with what we know. So, I guess if Fund XII turned on, you'd add $10.6 billion, you'd subtract the $1 billion that you've put in yourself, and then the step-down on NAXI is like...
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Look, Chris...
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So you'd end up with like $53 billion, $54 billion.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And so, the way we're thinking about it, if you're talking very specifically about NAXI and then Americas XII turning on, we think we're actually going to see and hit a $12 billion hard cap or LP money. So, as far as fee-paying AUM, you should see that number go up by $12 billion.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, you mentioned a tech, healthcare and venture capital kind of fund that you're working on. Are those three separate funds or is it one fund? And roughly how much from your balance sheet investments are you putting into that and how much external money do you anticipate raising?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Right now, the numbers aren't that big. But just to address the question, as it relates to TMT growth, we actually have a fund and we're raising capital for that right now. It's not showing up on the fund table yet, only for the fact that it's early stages. And so, we would expect to raise anywhere between $500 million and $750 million in that fund upon its close and once that does take place, you'll see that in the fund table. And the amount that we'll commit to that strategy is roughly going to be $150 million.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: As it relates to healthcare growth, that is not a strategy where we're raising capital from third-party investors right now, and that's the beauty of the balance sheet. We're making those investments off the balance sheet directly. I mentioned earlier, through an SMA, we have the ability now to get a commitment from an SMA to invest side-by-side with us in that healthcare space. But over time, the assumption will be that, and this will again be over time, we'll more likely raise a dedicated healthcare growth fund.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: And, Chris, just on the first point you asked as it relates to NAXI and the impact of when Americas XII turns on, from a fee-paying standpoint, right now NAXI is at the full size of the committed fund. When it's in the post-investment period, it will be based off of remaining costs. So as of June 30, we had roughly $4.8 billion – $4.7 billion of remaining costs with still over $3 billion of uncalled commitments. You might see a modest decline from a fee-paying standpoint again once it enters the post-investment period.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And when I look at page nine of the presentation, there's $2 billion of deployment in the – that are pending. Is most of that in NAXI or is that spread through the funds?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: It's spread throughout the funds, but the predominant number is coming from net NAXI. So, if you take a look at the top three investments that are shown on page nine, those are all going to be net NAXI investments.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And do you have an estimated time when XII turns on or...?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Hard to predict. There's a lot of ebbs and flows. Right now, I would say that based upon signed commitments, we're about, say, 80% committed with that fund. We still need to size up how much we're going to need for a reserve before we go from NAXI to Americas XII, but I would say that it would probably be conservatively something that will take place in the first half or probably first quarter of 2017.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, Scott. Maybe just on the performance, the private equity performance is strong overall. I think on the exits, the MOCs were strong. Yet there's a lot of macro uncertainty out there. So can you just talk about the performance on the public versus the private side? And then more importantly, just any new insight you can give on how the portfolio is performing, whether it's on like EBITDA or revenue growth, just what you guys look at.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Sure. Happy to, Mike. It's a good question. Well, I think we've been able to see monetizations coming from a variety of different places, but in terms of the second part of your question on portfolio company performance, it's actually been quite good. So last 12 months, 7% or so revenue growth, 8% EBITDA growth. So 7% on the top line, 8% on the bottom line. If you look at that relative to the market, it's been having earnings declines year-over-year. We think there's a lot of very good things happening idiosyncratically within our portfolio based on the operational improvements we're able to make and it really has been coming from a lot of different places. So, we talked about the secondaries. We talked last quarter about some of the strategic exits that we've seen in particular on a global basis to buyers in Japan and China. And we've also been using the capital markets. So you've seen us do dividend deals, dividend recaps within the portfolio. So, I'd say it all starts with good operating fundamental performance within the portfolio and then a pretty robust bid on some strategic buyers and jumping through the capital market windows when they're open. There's been volatility, but we've seen the debt markets open. We jump through when they are and you've seen us take companies public like US Food when the IPO markets open. So, I think you see a lot of that continue. The reason that we've highlighted the 40% in public companies in the PE portfolio is we think we have a lot of access to liquidity going forward. And a good portion of our portfolio, 60% or so, is now valued in excess of 1.5 times cost over 40% in excess of 2 times cost. And so, the portfolio is quite mature. So, hopefully, that's a little bit of color that's helpful for you.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. No, it's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up maybe for Bill. Just on the transactions that you did on the balance sheet into like separate accounts, I don't know if you can look at it and say like how much volatility did those investments create in the past? I'm just trying to figure out why those assets – what the decision was. And this could be for Bill or Scott, but when you think about capital deployment, it seems like whenever you get close to your buyback authorization – and not just you guys, but everyone, that question comes up. On the flipside, it seems like over the past three to five years, you guys have been investing in a lot of growth areas. Can you maybe just spend a little bit of time, when we think about strategic investments like Marshall Wace versus putting some commitment in Fund XII or other strategic investments in companies, just where do you see the opportunities if the buyback pace is going to be a bit slower in the near term?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Mike. This is Bill. I'll take the first question, which was a heck of a lot shorter than the second question.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: But the punch line there is that, yeah, there is some volatility, the assets that we had on the balance sheet that we moved over to these two separately managed accounts, we mark-to-market every single quarter. I would say that when you take a look at the healthcare and the growth ones, in particular, because they're somewhat relatively new, as we've held those assets over the last 12 to 18 months, you wouldn't see a lot of volatility there. But on some of the more aged credit assets that we've had, you could see a little bit of volatility. But that honestly didn't come into any sort of thought process when we were trying to think about what to do with these assets. It just so happens that in conversations with these two investors, again, it just seemed like the right thing to do for us and for them, which is why we moved forward.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Look, I'd say on the balance sheet deal, Mike, I'd say it was largely done just from a position of strength. We viewed it as an interesting opportunity to access more capital for the firm, both LP capital and more for the balance sheet. But the only thing in there that we've been working to reduce our exposure and I've talked about in the past, the CLO equity, but we like the assets in there, that's why we wanted to keep the upside in the transactions that we structured. For the last part of your question, the capital deployment, look, it's hard to give you a precise answer on that. We have used the balance sheet, as you pointed out, to create fee-related earnings and carry opportunity for ourselves. And if you look at page 14 of the deck, and this is why I think it's really important that people kind of look at the overall model as a collective as opposed to the individual fees, carry, balance sheet on a discrete basis, page 14, I think, a picture worth a thousand words. We have used the balance sheet to fund a lot of this growth and seed strategies that have allowed us to access third-party capital. That's why our fee-paying AUM has doubled in the last five years. That's why you've seen the growth that you've seen. And so we used the balance sheet to help create fee and carry flow, and then we look at the returns on the capital we're deploying in aggregate, including those fee profits and carry profits. But having said all that, if you look at the last 12 months, the two biggest uses of cash flow from the balance sheet have been distributions and share repurchases, by far the two biggest uses. And then after that, you'd see Marshall Wace and you'd see our funding our GP commitments and our funds. And so that's what we've been using it for. That's how we think about it. When we have opportunities like we see on page 14 to seed and create these new businesses and scale them quickly and enhance the ROE for all of us as shareholders – and remember, we own 45% of the stock – we're going to use the balance sheet to do that. But as of late, we've been using it mostly for dividends and buybacks.
Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the last point on capital deployment strategy, I think you mentioned earlier cash. You view that as the best hedge in this environment. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about strategic M&A from the balance sheet perspective. You've done the Marshall Wace transaction, what other product or distribution gaps do you feel you have at this point that perhaps that cash could be put to use for that sort of opportunity?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Michael. This is Scott. I'll take that one. For strategic M&A, look, I think the way we're looking at the firm is we don't feel like we need to create new legs to the stool. We created the real estate business, as an example, four or five years ago. We don't see another real estate, like another big asset class that we want to build a business in. So really now, it's about scaling what we've started. And if you look at page 14 of the supplemental materials, when you think about the size of the end markets in the infrastructure space, real estate, credit, hedge funds, these are massive spaces where our market share is still pretty low. So, I think you could see us do more tuck-in type strategic M&A. Remember a couple, few years ago, we did the Avoca acquisition in Europe which added to our leveraged credit platform. I think you could see more things like that across our different asset classes that allows us to accelerate growth or gives us more of a presence in a specific market where we see opportunity like we see in European credit. I would not expect us to do a lot more strategic partnerships. As I've mentioned in the past, on hedge funds, we want to scale through our partnership with Marshall Wace as opposed to doing more of those. So, I would say on strategic M&A, it's probably going to be more tuck-in. And then over time, see if we can find things that we like for the balance sheet in bigger scale, but less likely to be big outright acquisitions. Probably a little bit smaller things from time to time when we really like it. We are burdened by the integration risk, and this is a hard space to make acquisitions and integrate them well. And so, they'll probably be few and far between.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. If I could just follow up one last question here. Certainly, the presentation this morning, helpful in terms of addressing some investor perceptions here from realization to deployment. I guess just how are you thinking about the key risks or concerns you have here that you're most focused on, whether it's on performance – certainly, the returns have been good historically. What are the key risk you have on future returns and then also on the realizations? With robust environment in 2Q, what do you see as the key risks as you move forward over the next 12 months?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Look, I think it's easy to overcomplicate what we do. If we generate strong investment returns, raising capital is more fun and relatively straightforward, and carry goes up, fees go up and the balance sheet performs better. And so, our focus is investment performance in the first instance; we have the saying here, performance, performance, performance. We say it three times every time we say it inside the firm because it really is just a critical part of the job every single day. And so, we are focused on that and that is not a risk per se, but it's just the most important thing we've got to get right. And so, there's nothing that we see in the horizon that causes us to have concern about that, but that is a primary area of focus. The other thing that we're spending a lot of time on is spending time with our investors. It is a very tricky environment for investing. The world is not used to ever having a period of time where there's $10 trillion of negative-yielding assets, and we're spending a lot of time with our limited partners, both long-standing and newer ones, and prospects, talking about this investing environment. And I think they're having a hard time thinking where to put their capital to generate attractive returns. We see that as an opportunity for us to be differentiated and value-added. And so, we're spending quite a bit of time there. So, it's more about just getting those things right, Michael, than anything that we're necessarily overly concerned about. Besides the day-to-day stuff, we have to keep our license to operate. We're very focused on making sure we operate best-in-class on all fronts and we have great teams in the firm focused on making sure that we all do that. But that's how we think about it. We got to perform and do a great job for our clients.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Super. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Patrick Davitt. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey, good morning. I just have one quick one left. I think in the past, you pushed back on the idea of expecting maybe kind of significant fee earning margin improvement. When we think about the slide 13 and the big jump from Americas XII coming in, the fact that you don't have what I imagine was a pretty big headwind going from 2006 to NAXI, given some of the smaller NAXI. Why shouldn't we expect a big pop in that particularly when XII turns on?
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Patrick, this is Bill. Very specifically around that, you will see margin improvement when we go from net NAXI to Americas XII only for the fact that all the costs or majority of the costs are already there. And so, you will see a big uptick in management fees and you will see margin improvement.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Fair enough. Thank you.
William Joseph Janetschek - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks and thanks for taking Ann's question before. But I just have one follow-up. I know a strategic initiative for you guys going back five-plus years has been to expand your LP base along with obviously the number of strategies. So could you maybe just update us if we look at Americas XII, maybe some kind of metrics? Kind of what you're seeing in terms of mix between existing and new clients to KKR and maybe any kind of color around – and I'm sure some of the new track, like how many of your LPs now have invested in multiple products versus, say, three, four years ago?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great. Happy to take that, Robert. So just by way of update, we now have about 950 investors across the firm and that continues to grow. When we really in earnest begin creating our marketing efforts, that number was closer to 300 or 325. So we've seen good growth. We still see a lot of opportunity for growth. The cross-sell statistic is about 1.7 products per customer. Right now, if you think about it, we've been – when you add a number of customers, you normally add them at one product each, so adding a lot of clients. We've kept that 1.7 times more or less constant as growth with existing is offset, adding the new clients. Our top 40 will average between three and four products, just to give you a sense for the opportunity ahead of us. And critically, we only have about a third of our clients in more than one product with us. So we think that's a massive opportunity for us. There's taking the 950 to a higher number, but then there's also the incremental opportunity of doing more with the 950 that we have, especially given two-third of them are only in one strategy with us. So a lot of opportunity. We track this closely, and I think big part of the reason you've seen the fundraising success we have is we've been expanding the investor base across the firm. So if you look as an example over the last seven or eight funds that we've closed, about 40% on average of number of LPs in these funds have been new to the firm. So it's been a huge part of building the firm out. If you look at Americas XII so far, you'd see that about 35% of the LPs in that fund so far are actually new. The dollars are going to be more weighted given the early close to existing LPs, but the number of LPs coming with us is about 35%. So, hopefully, that's helpful color, but we do see this as a big opportunity for us and why we're so focused on just generating returns and doing a great job for these investors, including helping them think through this environment.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. That was very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head-Global Capital & Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you everybody for joining us. We look forward to chatting next quarter.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Bridget. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, and that this call will also contain forward-looking statements which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And also, like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. Turning to the quarter, the first quarter was a bumpy ride across global capital markets. And like many others, we weren't immune. This morning, we reported our first quarter economic net loss of $507 million and an after-tax economic net loss per unit of $0.65. Total cash earnings for the quarter were $169 million. Now in our second quarter reporting under our fixed distribution policy, we have again announced a $0.16 per unit distribution. And on the buyback front from February 11, the date we last provided an update through April 21, we repurchased and canceled 10.9 million units for $170 million – $147 million, leaving us with about $110 million remaining under the current authorization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our performance in more detail. Bill?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Craig. To set the stage for our results, let me begin with our performance. Overall, our private equity portfolio was down 0.9% in the quarter, and on a trailing 12 months basis was up 7.7%. This compares to 0.2% decline to the MSCI World Index in the quarter and a 2.9% decline over the last year. So on a relative basis, our PE portfolio was in line with the MSCI over the three months with 1,000 basis points of outperformance over the last 12. Let's turn to page 2 of the earnings supplement that Craig mentioned earlier, which frames performance in more detail. This page, as you'll recall from prior quarters, reduced the performance of our benchmark funds. In the middle of the page, you can see that our flagship U.S. and Asia PE funds were flat for the quarter with meaningful outperformance on an LTM basis. While Europe III outperformed over both time periods. Within real assets, our real estate and infrastructure funds continued to perform, while EIGF has seen write-downs largely due to declines in underlying commodity prices. Shifting to alternative credit, Q1 was a volatile period, with leverage credit indices rebounding in March after a difficult start to the year. For the quarter, our benchmark Special Sits and Mezz funds were down modestly, though both continue to outperform their benchmarks by several hundred basis points on an LTM basis. Focusing on total segment financials, management, monitoring and transaction fees were $280 million. While fees were higher last quarter, launching as a result that defers data IPO and subsequent refinancings, this quarter we benefited from $25 million in net fees related to the Mills Fleet Farm transaction, which we talked about on last quarter's call. Performance income in the quarter was minus $125 million due to the modest declines in our carry paying funds. Realized carry was driven principally by activities from Masan and U.S. Foods. Shifting to investment income, investment performance was weaker this quarter as our balance sheet investments were marked down 5.4%. Scott is going to provide some additional color around this in a few minutes as this ultimately drove the $530 million of investment loss in the quarter. Cash compensation and benefits came in at about $100 million, lower on both a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis as we reduced compensation to protect margins given the decline in revenue in the quarter. Occupancy together with other operating expenses came in at $78 million, also lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Bringing it all together, fee-related earnings came in at $141 million with recorded pre-tax ENI at a loss of $557 million and after-tax ENI of about the same. Touching on AUM and fee-paying AUM. Page three of the supplement highlights the growth in our AUM over the last 12 months. Our AUM has increased 17% to $126 billion over this period driven primarily by $27 billion of new capital raised and the inclusion of $6 billion from the Marshall Wace transaction. Of note, the $126 billion includes over $18 billion of assets where we are not yet earning economics, so we haven't seen that impact on our management fees. Fee-paying AUM has also grown nicely and is up about 9% over the same-time period. In the quarter, AUM increased by $7 billion behind continued fundraising activity in private and public markets. Net inflows in private equities, specials sits, hedge funds, our strategic partnerships and a few of our liquid credit mandates were the noteworthy contributors. Fee-paying AUM increased $2 billion in the quarter, with relatively equal net contributing factors coming from private and public markets. This leaves us with approximately $35 billion of dry powder at the end of March. Moving to deployment, we invested $2 billion of capital in private markets, a 47% increase from last quarter. The large contributors were private equity investments in Mills Fleet Farm (06:43) NAXI, LGC and WebHealth within Europe IV, and Max Financial in Asia II. Before I hand things over to Scott, there are two additional items I'd like to touch on. The first relates to our private equity portfolio and the performance of our publics this quarter. If you turn to page four of the supplement, we've laid out a few key statistics. First, to reiterate, private equity performance has been quite strong within our benchmark funds. NAXI, Asia II and Europe III, all currently top quartile performing funds. This quarter, at a high level, performance was negatively impacted by our public holdings. And as you could see on the top of the page, we're down 7% compared to our privates which were up 4%. As of March 31, publics comprised over 40% of the total PE portfolio. Taking a step back, as everyone on the call understands, public holdings can swing over any 90-day period. And while we felt that impact of that volatility this quarter, we benefit from long-term locked-up capital and aren't for sellers. Additionally, when you look at the performance of our top five level one public holdings on the bottom left hand side of the page, you'll understand why we feel very good about these investments. Four of the five are trading at between 3.5 times and 5.3 times our cost, and we continue to have a great deal of conviction around First Data. And then looking at the health of the overall PE portfolio, as you can see in the bottom right hand corner of the page, over 60% of our investments are marketed above 1.5 times cost, with over 40% above 2 times cost. In a period where our publics were adversely impacted by market volatility, these stats highlight the strong fundamentals of our PE portfolio and its increasing maturity. Finally, I'd like to circle back on monetizations. While we had a handful of exits in Q1, Q2 has been even more active. Page five highlights this more clearly. Q1 saw the dividend recap at U.S. Foods, exits in two of our Asian portfolio companies, and a small realization out of our flagship real estate fund. Looking forward, we have a nice pipeline of activity. Of particular note, we've seen an increase in cross-border M&A. Examples here include announced transaction that Group SMCP, a leading French fashion company which is being sold to a large Chinese textile manufacturer; the sale of a minority stake in a UK-regulated water company to Mitsubishi Corporation; and the sale of Alliance Tire, an India-based off-highway tire manufacturer to Yokohama Rubber Company. While these transactions have yet to close, as we look at them today, these three exits were done at 2.1 times cost with an IRR of gross 31%. We've also seen cross-border M&A activity within our underlying portfolio of companies. Haier, our largest investment in China, acquired GE's white good business, and Panasonic Healthcare completed the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care business. Given our global platform and relationships, we're continuing to build this track record of helping companies accomplish their goals through our (10:22) cross-border strategic M&A, which should further position us as a partner of choice. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Q1 was a volatile and strange quarter. Since 1986, no period besides 2008 to 2009 has had a larger number of three standard deviation moves across asset classes. Cutting through it all, there are two main stories this quarter from our point of view. The first and most important is our ongoing progress building our businesses. The second are the unrealized marks flowing through our financial statements as a result of how all the volatility happened to land on March 31. Let me discuss each of these. I'll start with business building. The success we're having is best evidenced by our AUM, which as Bill walked through, has increased 17% on a year-over-year basis driven by the $27 billion in new capital that's been raised organically over this period. In terms of the quarter, we've held closes on several funds and feel good about our fundraising momentum across multiple products. Special Sits II held its final close at $3.4 billion this quarter and the special sits strategy now manages over $9 billion in assets compared to $2.5 billion three years ago. On the heels of our $1.3 billion capital raised for Direct Lending II last year, we recently held an $850 million final close on Lending Partners Europe, our first direct lending fund with a Europe-focused mandate. At a time when traditional lenders are pulling back, deleveraging and cleaning up their balance sheets, we feel well positioned to capitalize given our credit platform. Other recent activity included initial close on our private credit opportunities fund, or PCOF II, the successor to our Mezzanine fund, as well as an initial close on our next-generation technology growth fund, or NGT. Prior to forming NGT, our technology and media growth equity platform had been funded largely with balance sheet capital. Several warehouse balance sheet investments will be transferred into the fund, again illustrating the power of our balance sheet to accelerate fundraising. Shifting over to hedge funds, our strategic partnership with Marshall Wace has developed very positively in its first six months and is well ahead of our expectations. They have a deep pool of talent around the globe, and their management team has built a robust and diversified business that combines systematic and discretionary equity strategies. We see real momentum in their business and large incremental demand for their hedge fund products, which combine long-term track records and institutional infrastructure. With strong investment performance in 2015, a broad suite of products and new product launches, Marshall Wace is well positioned for 2016. And shifting to America's private equity, we're making excellent progress on NAXI's successor and we expect to hit our hard cap of $12 billion of third-party capital. Fundraising has progressed quickly, which we believe is due to NAXI's strong performance and the continuing expansion of our client base. We'll keep you updated as we progress on this topic. Overall, since 2010, we've seen our total client count grow from 344 to 920, about 2.5 times. And the number of fund investors in multiple products has more than doubled over this timeframe. Our investment in distribution globally and our strong performance are paying off. We have significant opportunities to scale our client franchise from here. Now let me move on to investment performance. Now we've built KKR with a focus on long-dated capital, and in turn measure performance through a lens much longer than any 90-day period. Our model allows us to weather and capitalize on short-term dislocation and that's exactly what we've been doing. With record dry powder to begin the year, we've been finding interesting investment opportunities and deployment in private markets, in particular, was healthy in the quarter. Having long-term capital with the ability to enter and exit investments at points in time and at valuations we deem attractive is, quite frankly, one of our largest strategic advantages and beneficial to all of us as investors. This advantage, however, does not exempt us from mark-to-market losses and volatile quarters like Q1. Bill covered the performance of our fund in the quarter, so let me talk through our balance sheet performance specifically. While we believe our business is one that should not be evaluated over any 90-day period, looking at Q1, balance sheet investment performance was below our expectations as the 5.4% mark-to-market decline drove an unrealized investment loss of $565 million in the quarter. The most significant component of this unrealized loss was the marks on our largest public holdings. You can see those on page six of the deck. The share price declines in the quarter at our three largest balance sheet positions – First Data, Walgreens, and WMI Holdings – combined to create a $270 million unrealized loss in Q1. But March 31 is just a snapshot in time. Looking back, these three holdings contributed approximately $650 million of positive investment income over 2014 and 2015, but in a volatile Q1 2016, they took a step back. Let me spend a moment on First Data in particular, given its significance. First Data stock declined from approximately $16 to $13 per share over the quarter. This does not concern us. From our standpoint, fundamental performance at the company has been quite good. First Data's fourth quarter results showed adjusted revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%. And this morning, First Data reported Q1 results with top line growth of 5% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%. If First Data continues to produce results like these, we're going to end up in a very good position down the road. In addition to the declines in our large holdings, we did see further write-downs this quarter in our energy portfolio. With natural gas and crude prices declining three to four years out on a forward curve, DCF values were negatively impacted. And as a result, we saw a little over $100 million in unrealized losses from our energy portfolio. And finally, there were a handful of positions within our credit and specialty finance portfolios which also saw write-downs in the quarter. Overall, everything I just covered accounted for almost all of our unrealized balance sheet losses in Q1. Given the focus on balance sheet performance and its impact on our results, I'd like to shift gears a bit and discuss the evolution of our balance sheet. Going back in time, you'll recall our balance sheet is the result of merging with two of our own permanent capital vehicles, KPE in 2009 and KFN in 2014. These transactions created and expanded our permanent capital base and provided for more recurring cash earnings. At the time of the transactions, we saw opportunities to redeploy capital over time into higher returning assets. In effect, we've been transitioning these two portfolios to a more permanent and optimal asset allocation. Take a look at page seven, which details the evolution of our balance sheet since 2009. At the time of the merger with KPE, 97% of KPE's investments were in private equity including the First Data and Walgreens co-investments. As we realized investments from that largely PE portfolio, we redeployed capital to see new product offerings for the firm. As a result, immediately prior to the KFN acquisition in April 2014, that figure had declined to approximately 60% in PE. Then we acquired KFN, which was largely a yielding credit portfolio. As a result, credit investments including specialty finance grew to roughly $3 billion or 37% of fair value immediately after the KFN acquisition approximately two years ago. You can see this in the middle pie chart on page seven. Since then, as investments have matured or been monetized, we've redeployed capital into higher returning investment opportunities. So today, the credit portfolio is about $2.1 billion or 26% of SMB, and we're on our way to reducing it further. If you dig into the detail, our acquired CLO 1.0 portfolio, which is CLOs issued pre-2012, have actually been reduced from $1.2 billion to $500 million or nearly 60% in the last two years. In its place, we've been creating new CLOs called CLO 2.0 in the chart, where we hold a small portion of the equity on our balance sheet and generate new management fees for the firm. So far, our total CLO equity portfolio has declined from 19% of our balance sheet investments to 10%. Going forward, you should expect us to have lower overall credit exposure made up of even less exposure to CLOs relative to where we are today and larger GP commitments to our alternative credit funds. Given the illiquid nature of many of these existing investments, this transition will not happen overnight but we're well on our way. In addition to changes to our credit book, we've also been reducing our exposure to other legacy assets and redeploying the proceeds into our own funds and strategic initiatives, both hitting new businesses like growth equity and real estate credit and making strategic investments like Marshall Wace. Stepping back, the primary use of our balance sheet over the last several years has been to cede or acquire new businesses and accelerate the growth of our third party AUM and our capital markets business. Said another way, a lot of the economics from how we have used our balance sheet do not show up in investment income but it does show up through our AUM fees and carry. As you can see on the chart, AUM has grown over this period from $50 billion to $126 billion or by $76 billion, increasing our management fees and carry opportunity meaningfully as a result. To wrap things up, as I said, Q1 was a strange and volatile quarter. But looking through the volatility, we feel very good about how we're positioned. We're pleased with our fund investment performance. Fundraising's been strong. With record dry powder, we've been deploying capital into a dislocated environment. And we successfully exited investments through strategic M&A, secondary sales and leverage recaps. We're not immune to mark-to-market in a given quarter, but we don't invest, manage or build our businesses with a 90-day view. In fact, we think market volatility is great for us over the long term. We built KKR to outperform by capitalizing on markets like these. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: And Bridget, just before we open it up, just looking at the screen we have quite a long queue so if we could ask everyone to please limit it to one question and follow up if necessary, we would appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is going to be from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate the update. So it sounds like you may have bought back like another 1 million units around numbers from the end of the month until now. So just stepping back, Scott, with sort of your last discussion point on the migration of your balance sheet and then sort of the redeployment of that capital, could you counterbalance how you sort of see return of capital to investors versus growth in some of these other initiatives? And then more specifically to that, how you're thinking about incremental buyback assuming you would have finished off this current $500 million authorization.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great. Thanks for the question, Bill. Yeah. Just by way of background, look, we do see a lot of opportunities to grow our firm and our businesses. And as I mentioned with the next-generation technology growth fund real estate credit, we continue to use the balance sheet to seed new businesses and drop them into funds format so that we can accelerate management fee and carry realization. So we'll continue to do that and we see a lot of opportunities to continue to use the balance sheet for that purpose. As background, as I think as you're aware, we announced a $500 million buyback in late October, and we started buying stock in early November. So at the time we announced the program, we said we thought we'd spend the $500 million over 12 months or so. And we also said that our goal was to keep our share count flat over time to control dilution from comp-related share issuances. So we said $500 million and we thought it would take about a year to spend. Over the last less than six months, we've bought back or canceled about 30 million shares and so we've spent $400 million, give or take, of the $500 million already in less than six months. So we feel like we're kind of on pace – ahead of pace, actually, in delivering on our objectives. And our share count actually has come down since the announcement. So we don't plan on forecasting buyback activity build, but what we're happy to share is that we do see a lot of opportunities to continue to invest in the firm and grow our businesses, our fee and carry businesses, in particular. It doesn't mean we're going to buy back shares continuously, but we are committed to, at a minimum, keeping our share count flat over time. So we have our framework internally for how we compare the price of our stock to the internal opportunities. So far, the light's been green so we've been buying. But we'll keep you posted as we go forward.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And Bill, this is Bill Janetschek. Just as a follow-up. Can I help you with the math a little? As of March 31, total units outstanding were about 845.4 million shares. From March 31 through Friday of last, we actually bought back another 2.4 million shares and cancelled an additional 2 million shares vis-à-vis the tax allocation. So the share count right now, as we stand today, is down to 841 million.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks very much. Curious, on the seven exits so far in April that you announced, did you mention what type of the distributable earnings are attributable to them?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Glenn. This is Bill Janetschek.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi, Bill.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Right now, as we stand today, if I did the math on the seven, the cash carry that would come to us would be approximately $0.16 in total. And then, to the extent that we have some economics by our GP interest in those assets as well, that would produce roughly about another $0.07 of cash earnings on our balance sheet.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. I appreciate that. And then could you remind us the process on how investments make their way – new investments going forward, make their way on to the balance sheet? What goes into funds, what gets co-invested on balance sheet? Is that a corporate decision, one investment at a time?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Glenn. It's Scott. I think the most straightforward way to think about it is the balance sheet is a large investor in our funds, and oftentimes these are the largest or certainly one of the largest investor in all of our funds. So when you have a drawdown of capital that goes into a fund, the balance sheet capital is just drawn down pro rata alongside the limited partner investors. And that's how the vast majority of the capital is getting deployed these days off the balance sheet. So just every time we announce a transaction across asset classes, think of it as the balance sheet making a pro rata investment alongside the third party investors. Periodically, we'll also announce strategic activity, and that's clearly 100% balance sheet. Things like the Marshall Wace transaction, as an example. And also even less periodically, we'll have co-investments where the balance sheet will participate. But I'd point to the vast majority of activity is just going alongside the third party LPs.
Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI: So I guess over time we should see public – never mind. Okay. I got it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. Good morning, guys. Looks like the energy mark was significantly higher than even the curve moved in the quarter, at least the oil curve. Is there like some real impairment to some of those positions? Can you help walk through why it appears to be so disconnected this quarter?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Patrick. This is Bill. If you take a look at where we marked the portfolio in December and where we marked the portfolio in March, when you take a look at where the three- and four-year forward curve is, it was down roughly 14% and 16%, respectively. And so when you run that through a DCF, you should expect that our energy portfolio would be down in about that percentage range.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: So nothing really to talk about as far as any impairments.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the private equity investments, a little surprised by the 4% increase in this backdrop. Just curious if that was a function of some specific situations or movement in public comps. And can you also provide any perspective around the type of discount you're applying right now relative to the public comps and how that's changed maybe over the past year since the privates have outperformed quite a bit up about 10% relative to a flattish market?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Devin. This is Bill. Just at a high level on the privates, when you think about it where we were carrying some of our private investments in December and then where we marked them in March, we mentioned that they were a couple of strategic that we're selling. So during this quarter, you actually saw a pretty nice uplift in those investments. Typically, when we value our privates, 50% is DCF, 50% is market comp, and we usually take a liquidity discount on those values. Obviously, when someone comes in and you have a strategic for 100% of the company and someone's willing to pay a premium, you're going to see an increase in those privates.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. The only other thing I'd add, Devin, is that we do have seen good operational performance in the private equity portfolio. So if you look at kind of the weighted average performance across the portfolio globally, the last 12 months about 8% revenue growth and about 10% EBITDA growth. So it's really a combination of good underlying operational performance, plus some strategic exits that Bill mentioned.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Great. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up here. On Europe, last quarter you guys were pretty constructive on the call, I'm curious how you're feeling today. It sounds like you still are. And I guess I'm just more curious with Brexit, that conversation. Is the timing there impacting activity or is stuff on hold until kind of post-decision?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great question. Look, the private equity funds in Europe are continuing to perform really well. The underlying portfolio is performing, but it's not just private equity. We're also seeing good performance across credit, real estate, infrastructure, and really strong performances we've seen in the last 10 years ex-energy. So we've been busy. We've been selling businesses in Europe. Buying is a bit more challenging with high prices, but we managed to get a couple of things announced, including the Airbus Defence Electronics deal. And financing is available. So, yeah, we can remain constructive on Europe overall and see lots of opportunity. In terms of the Brexit question, it is impacting how we think about investing in the UK in particular, but it's really much more isolated to the UK as opposed to Pan European.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Understood. Great. Thanks, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. So a question about the marks on the balance sheet this quarter. You highlighted here that around $350 million tied to First Data and energy, that still leaves about $240 million of other write-downs. You mentioned, I think, that this is tied to a handful of other positions. Wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what happened with those positions in the quarter. And then if we step back more broadly and think about the balance sheet, it sounds like we think the First Data marks are sort of technical in nature. The energy marks clearly some fundamental issues going on there. But how would you guys characterize the other marks, whether you think they're broadly technical or whether there's some more fundamental problems in those underlying investments?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Chris. It's Scott. I guess your math – I think your math's right. So you're right. If you look at page six of the deck, you can see, if I lump together Walgreens and WMI with First Data, if you look at just what's on that page, you've got $380 million, give or take, of marks there just in those positions. And that's kind of the first big bucket. The other balance sheet marks are really going to be – have a couple of themes to them. One is going to be some credit positions we have that will have some indirect exposure to energy so that there's some look through in the credit book to some energy names. And that would be the other big theme. Everything else will be just little one-offs for the most part of individual comps that have traded down in the quarter, but no other big themes that I'd point you to. So it's kind of the big ones listed on page six, plus a little bit of read-through through the energy credit portfolio. And in terms of the second question as to how we characterize those marks, look, I think for the vast majority of what we saw in Q1, it was moment in time mark-to-market unrealized. If you really look at the face of the financial statements, you can see there is about $24 million of realized losses. Everything else was mark-to-market. And so as we kind of look at the underlying exposures that we have, our view is the vast, vast preponderance of the marks are just related to the volatility and some of the noise that we're seeing in terms of commodity prices or otherwise. Very few of those positions or situations where our option can be truncated for us. So the vast majority of those are going to be situations where we do not have necessarily gun to our head. It's more that we've seen a mark, and we anticipate that the vast majority of that will come back as markets normalize. And we've probably already seen some of that in Q2, but we'll continue to watch the markets closely.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And then when you look at the balance sheet, in particular, when you take into account interest and dividend income even net interest expense, as Scott mentioned that $25 million realized loss, on a realized basis we ended up booking an investment gain cash earnings of in excess of $35 million.
Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. I'd like to ask Scott to elaborate a bit on the comments you made about credit. And just going from 37% of the balance sheet to 26% in the span of just two years seems fairly dramatic, and I'm curious to what extent does that reflect a much more cautious view on the credit cycle. And I guess, also, if you can elaborate a little bit on what are the relative risks of CLO 1.0 versus CLO 2.0 and of a GP investment in a fund. How do you see the risk reward of those three categories of investments?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great, Chris. Happy to take it. So you're right. We have gone from 37% credit June 2014, to about 26% as of March 31. But I'll point you back to when we announced the KFN acquisition, and we said that we saw an opportunity to redeploy a lot of the capital on the KFN balance sheet into higher returning opportunity, including business building. So as a reminder, the KFN portfolio when we bought it, was about a 10% to 11% ROE business. And we thought that we could generate higher returns by monetizing some of those legacy investments and redeploying the cash into other opportunities that we saw at the firm. And so that was really the articulated strategy when we did the deal. And a big portion of this, Chris, is just us following through on that commitment. So if you look at the pie chart, you can see the biggest change on the pie charts on page seven is really what we call the 1.0 book shrinking from 15% of the balance sheet down to 6%, and that's been purposeful. Really, what we saw there was that we had a lot of CLOs that were done pre-crisis that were getting into their periods where we could call them. The return on equity was at such a level we thought it was the right thing to do is to call those CLOs, and that's really what we've been doing. So that's what is a big portion of the move in terms of the reduction in the credit exposure. And then we've been redeploying the proceeds into several new things, as you can see at the bottom of page seven, that we do think have a higher return than the 10% to 11% that the KFN portfolio was yielding. So...
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So just as a follow-up, I mean, there was about $1 billion, I think, of debt that had 25-year to 30-year maturities. Are those the funds you're redeploying? Is it in the KFN legal structure?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: No. To be really clear, there's two things going on here. So KFN had investments in CLOs, so we own the equity in CLOs that we were managing. And then KFN as an entity had created a capital structure for itself and had borrowed money and issued preferred stocks that were very long-dated in nature. So we moved the liabilities over to KKR's balance sheet, and we continue to enjoy the benefits of that long-dated financing to finance all of KKR now in a holistic basis. And on the asset side, some of those investments that KFN we're making, those are the ones that we called and have been redeploying the cash into new investment opportunities.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then...
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Go ahead.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Finally, on the Hudson Yards, is your investment there limited to your headquarters or does it go beyond that?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: It's just limited to our headquarter purchase.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: It's just our headquarter purchase. But one thing I want to come back to on the second part of your CLO question, Chris, is around the 2.0 investments that we've made. And really, the distinction we're making there is that we're issuing new CLOs. Our balance sheet is taking an equity position in those, but at this point, it's just a minimum required for risk retention. And the newer CLOs that we're doing, actually the equity investment in those CLOs, is not marked-to-market. And so you'll see that as a footnote in our press release. So the way I would think about that is that we're issuing new CLOs, we're booking a management fee on that new liability structure, and we're making a modest investment in the equity of those CLOs and we think the return on equity of the CLO 2.0 book is going to be very attractive, mid-teens 20%-plus.
Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Talk a little about the management fee development, maybe if you can just – a couple of things, I guess just highlight the fund raising outlook for this year. You're certainly between NAXI XII and some of the real estate investments and anything else that you want to highlight. And also, how you view the timing of the $18 billion of shadow AUM coming on to fee based AUM. And I guess related to that, how do you think appetite for more alternative manager acquisitions like Marshall Wace and Prisma?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great. I'll take one and three and Bill will take two. In terms of the overall fund raising, look, it's been busy. As I mentioned, Q1 Special Sits II, European direct lending, growth tech, initial closed, and then of course Americas XII, off to a great start. So there's been a lot of going on. As we look at the rest of this year and say one continued fund raising for Americas XII. We have our second opportunistic real estate fund, REPA II, we call it, in the market. We'll be wrapping up fund raising for European real estate fund, REPE (42:31). We've got our PCOP II fund, a successor to Mezz end market, and then we'll continue raising capital for growth equity. And so those call it five or so funds will be in market for a good chunk of the rest of this year. Coming down the pike, we've got Global Direct Lending III because we've seen quite good pace of development in Direct Lending II. And then at some point, we'll be talking to you about Asia private equity but it's a bit early. And then on top of that, we've got the continuously raised capital across Prisma, a new suite of products there, Marshall Wace, Nephila, high yield leverage loans, CLOs, SMAs, et cetera. So quite a bit going on the fund raising front. In terms of the acquisition question, I would not expect us to do a lot more stakes investments. Marshall Wace, we think, is a great platform from which to build. So I would expect the vast preponderance of our activity on a go-forward basis. In the hedge fund space, we'll be with our partners at Marshall Wace, if not the entirety of our activity going forward. And beyond that, we'll be opportunistic, but there's nothing that's in our sights at this point.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And Brian, as it relates to the $18.1 billion coming online, 99% of that is going to be fee paying. And the good news is a lot of that is on the public market side, alternative credit, direct lending. Scott mentioned PCOP II. All of those are higher fees paying AUM, as well as on the private market side like North America XII, et cetera. And so the blended rate on that $18 billion is going to be north of 1.1%. So, that's the good news. And as far as deployment is concerned, a lot of that fee coming online is going to be based upon when those assets are actually investing. And remember, the typical investment period on the public market side is roughly around three years. On the private market side, it could be anywhere between four and six. And so that $18 billion you'll see come online, certainly, over the next two, three, four years.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'm sorry. Do the $18 billion, you said that included in NAXI XII or was NAXI XII outside of that?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: No. Well, right now, NAXI XII, it would only be an AUM. It wouldn't be a fee paying AUM.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Right. Okay. So it's part of that $18 billion?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Right. Got it. Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A question for you guys again, back to the balance sheet for a second. I wanted to touch on the (45:20) you did earlier this quarter, $345 million. I guess, taking a step back, the change in distribution policy was either to do a buyback or grow the balance sheet with distributable earnings coming in still kind of ahead of the $0.16 a quarter. It feels like there's room to still do both of those things. So just trying to understand the rationale for the prefs and your expected use of proceeds.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Alex. It's Scott. I would just – nothing particular to call out there. We think it's attractive cost, long-term it's perpetual capital. And so we kind of view the general corporate purposes to give us an ability to do the two things you mentioned, invest further in building the business or buybacks or both. So nothing to call out with particular use of proceeds. It's just normal corporate financing.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then just a quick follow-up for Bill, I guess. Among the dry powder that you guys have currently raised and funded that are in market today, if we think about the commitment for KKR to co-invest in some of those yields, what is that amount right now?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Well, it all depends on the mandate, but the GP commitment for a private equity fund is going to be anywhere in between 3% and 5%. And the same will hold true on the public market side and more established funds. But to the extent that we're raising capital in a new mandate where we want to really jumpstart it, either A, we'll season it with capital on a balance sheet and drop some of those assets into that particular fund, or we'll make a stronger commitment as the GP in that particular mandate.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Gerald O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks. And thanks for the update on the Marshall Wace integration. Just a quick question. Could you potentially remind us or maybe elaborate on some of the new product launches that you touched on, and I guess as it relates to management fees that might be associated with those strategies? Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. In terms of the way to think about it perhaps, most of what we're in the market with right now will be more traditional private equity-style economics, call it 1.25% to 1.5% management fees for most of the products, it'll be 20% carry. And that's certainly the case across Americas XII, REPA II, which is the real estate fund I mentioned, REPE (47:53) which is our European real estate and growth equity. PCOP II, which the successor to our Mezzanine funds, also has similar economics. The distinction though in the credit funds and the private credit funds in particular is that instead of getting paid on committed and invested capital, in those funds we tend to get paid just on invested. So you won't see the fees come online until the capital starts to be invested in the ground. And so it'll show up in the AUM but may take a little bit longer to show up in the fee-paying side in terms of impacting the management fee line. And direct lending is similar to PCOP II in that regard. So most of those products are going to be fee- and carry-based, think long-term capital, three to six years to invest and then seven to twelve-plus to harvest. So really long-term capital in nature. The more continuously raised capital that I mentioned, high yield, leverage loans, hedge funds are going to be shorter dated and they typically will have either management fee only or management fee plus some incentive.
Gerald Edward O'Hara - Jefferies LLC: Understood. Thank you. That's it for me.
Operator: Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Good morning.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I apologize if maybe you went through some of this before, but could we maybe drill down a little bit more into the new capital raised in AUM? In private markets, of the $6.6 billion, I mean how much of that was maybe the new North American fund and then how much was the other strategies? And I guess as a follow up to that, I mean you did mention what the targeted hard cap is on the new North American fund. But could you maybe, if possible, update us on some of your target fundraisings for some of the other strategies that you're out there with?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Rob. This is Bill Janetschek. Just real quickly, I'll go through the particulars on the $11 billion that we raised this quarter, and Scott can elaborate more just on the particular strategies like what the hard cap might be on North America XII. But if you turn to page 11 on the private market side, most of that new capital raise is attributed to North America XII with some attributed to the growth technology fund that we raised. On the private market side, that gets you to that $6.6 billion. On a public market side, we're talking about $4 billion, and that came across several mandates. We raised over $1 billion in some credit SMAs. We had the final close of Special Sits at roughly $700 million. We had a final close on European direct lending. We actually had $600 million come in from Prisma, which was a very good number in a particular quarter. And remember, we report 25% roughly of the strategic partnerships that we own. Roughly, we own 25% in each. And when you drill down, our pro rata of that was roughly about $800 million. And so that makes up the $10 billion-plus that we've raised this quarter alone.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. And just to the second part of your question. I think the way to think about the Americas XII is we do have a $12 billion cap which we expect to hit. As I mentioned, that excludes the GP and employee and commitment, to be clear. So we think it'll probably be something more in the $12.5 billion to $13 billion range by the time we're done. I also want to point out as a reminder, we raise money for private equity in three geographic funds. So we're a bit different in that regard. So you've got Americas, Europe and Asia. And if you add those numbers up, if you say $12 billion, give or take for Americas, $6 billion for Asia, $4 billion or so for Europe, we're at about $22 billion in terms of expected capital for this fund cycle for private equity globally. If we go to the other part of your question, which is around how to think about these other funds, we haven't put out a cap on any of those other funds at this point. Maybe just in terms of a framework, though, in terms of how to think about it. Remember, most of our first-time funds are in the range of $500 million to $1 billion. And so as you think about next-gen tech growth, as an example, or a European real estate fund, those new strategies will tend to be in that ZIP code and I think that's a fair way to think about it. Then we have successor funds in real estate and mezzanine or private credit. The first real estate fund was about $1 billion of outside capital, and the first Mezzanine fund was about $1 billion, give or take, of total capital as well. And so like our other successor funds, we'd hope to see growth over those numbers, but we'll keep you updated through the course of the year.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay. So I understand the losses related to the balance sheet were largely unrealized, and as you pointed out, the balance sheet is much more diversified today relative to prior periods. But with First Data skew in the quarter as much as it did, and I understand that position is a bit of a unique situation, but just wondering how you might be thinking about sort of addressing concentration risk related to the balance sheet going forward if at all.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks for the question, Michael. If you look at the balance sheet chart on page seven, look at the far right, you'll see that we actually called out First Data and Walgreens in the pie chart. And First Data is about 12.5% of our balance sheet, and Walgreens is about 9%. And so, if you look in the grand scheme of the firm, obviously, the balance sheet ignores the $126 billion now of third-party AUM that we manage. So if you think about an individual position, even First Data at 12.5% of the balance sheet, and then the balance sheet is obviously just part of the overall organization, we feel good about the trajectory of that company, and we think that we'll be able to generate good returns on that investment going forward, same thing with Walgreens. But we will continue to look at trade-offs as to the trajectory from here for those individual names and other things we have on the balance sheet relative to other uses of capital. So we don't have a particular goal in terms of the – we want to get the exposure down to X. What we'd really like to do is have the value creation thesis from here in both those names continue to play out. And then, over time, you'll probably see us lighten up, but it's very – very early on First Data to expect that in the near-term. We think there's a lot of upside from here. Walgreens, as we mentioned in a prior slide, has performed very nicely for us so far and is already 3.5 times our cost. So maybe a slightly different story there.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on real estate just to follow up there, could you just update us on the build-out of your real estate platform? Which I know you started off your balance sheet a couple of years ago. Recently, you've been investing on the real estate credit side. Just how that's been progressing, the strategy around that, and any thoughts on timing for raising a third-party fund.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Great question. So, look, I'd say the real estate business has been developing really well. And certainly at least in line with our expectations, if not ahead of. So, as a reminder, we did seed our opportunistic real estate strategy off the balance sheet and dropped those investments down into a first-time real estate fund that we call REPA. That fund right now has a gross IRR of about 26%. So, so far, so good on that. We're in the market now with REPA II marketing off that track record. So the opportunistic strategy is going quite well. I also mentioned that we are in the market and have had the first closing on our first European real estate fund, and that's because we saw so much opportunity to invest in real estate in Europe. We'd filled up the baskets on our global fund and needed more capital, so that fund is progressing quite nicely. And we've already raised $600 million of capital for real estate Europe. You're right in credit. We saw an opportunity, brought a team over from Rialto not long ago. Same story again. We seeded investments in a real estate credit portfolio off the balance sheet. We're dropping that portfolio into a vehicle where we'll have third party investors alongside us, and we'll seek more third party capital fee in carry paying to invest with us in real estate credit, both whole loans and a variety of other opportunistic situations we see in the credit space given how the markets have evolved there. We're looking at the CMBS market closely as well. So we see opportunities in credit to expand, and that's a very large marketplace. And then if you go to places like Asia and India, we've actually created some vehicles and are investing on the ground in India in real estate as well. So relatively early days but the development of the business has gone quite well today.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And just quickly to follow up, I saw in your press release a reference to real estate investment trust holdings of about $300 million or so that are not held for investment on the balance sheet, are you creating a REIT of some sort? Just any color you can share around that.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Michael. This is Bill. Just to be clear, the assets right now are in a structure where it is a REIT, and we anticipate a raise in third party capital through that vehicle. And we're holding those assets to maturity and that's why we had that footnote.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and our last question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Michael Roger Carrier - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, guys. Hey Scott, maybe just on the marked-to-market in the quarter, you mentioned some of the portfolio trends in terms of revenues and EBITDA, and it seems like things are progressing still relatively well given the backdrop. So I just want to get your take on what are you guys looking for to turn that around. And maybe, if you have an update, I don't know, quarter-to-date on where things stand. But I just wanted to get a sense on what are you guys looking at in terms of the drivers to shift that?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Mike. Happy to take a shot at that. So look, I think, for us, we're focused on what we can control. And the biggest driver, in our view, over time of performance of our portfolio is how the companies are performing from an operating standpoint. That's why I called out the 8% revenue growth, the 10% EBITDA growth. Even in names like First Data, that's why we called out the 5% revenue growth, the 13% EBITDA growth for Q1. And our view is if our companies continue to perform like that, then over time we'll perform quite nicely. And you can see bottom left-hand side of page four how the biggest names have performed in terms of multiple of invested capital. So the operating performance continues to be strong in the first quarter. No big change in trends that I'd point you to. And I think the important thing is for us all to remember that we can't get too hung up on the recency effect. The market was quite volatile in Q1. We find ourselves in a bit of an emotional market with a bias to negativity. And our job as investors is to monetize the emotion. And so when we've got volatility and things get cheaper, we're investing into that, and that's why you saw the deployment that you saw in the quarter. And when the market gets happier again, we're selling into it and that's why you've seen the exits in the quarter both the strategics and secondaries into the market, and the refinancing that we've been doing when the market gets more upbeat as well. So we'll continue to monetize the emotion. The portfolio is performing quite nicely. There's a couple of areas like energy which we talked about. Industrials are in a bit of a recession in the U.S., but our global portfolio continues perform well, and our job is just to continue to monetize the environment over time. And that's why we encourage you not to look over any 90-day period, which continue to show the LTM results, the since-inception results. The balance sheet IRR since the beginning of 2010 is about 14.5%, and so we encourage you think with that longer-term mindset. We've got 600 basis points of outperformance over the MSCI over that timeframe, and we think we can continue to generate outperformance even as the balance sheet's been in transition.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Brian. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO, and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. As always, we would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. This call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. And also, like previous quarters, we've posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll be referring to over the course of the call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Of note, we reported fourth quarter and full year ENI of $145 million and $1.3 billion, equating to $0.08 and $1.21 of after-tax ENI per unit. Total cash earnings were $169 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year. In terms of our distribution and share repurchase activity, as you'll likely remember, on our last earnings call we announced some key changes to our capital management priorities and moved from a purely variable distribution to a fixed distribution policy. And at the same time, we announced a $500 million share buyback authorization. In turn, we announced this morning for the fourth quarter the regular fixed distribution of $0.16 per unit, which implies an annualized yield of 5.5% based on last night's closing price, well above the yield levels seen across most S&P 500 companies. As it relates to the buyback, as we walk through on the front cover of the press release, since October 27, which was the date when we announced our authorization, we repurchased and canceled 17.5 million units for $270 million, and in addition, 1.7 million equity award units were canceled for $27 million to satisfy tax obligations in connection with their vesting. So, in total 19.2 million units have been retired on a fully diluted basis for $298 million, and I'd note that the cancellation of the equity award units is incremental to our $500 million authorization. So as of today, we have $230 million remaining under the current plan. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our performance in more detail.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Craig. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we've adjusted the presentation of our results to include a fourth segment, Principal Activities. Our Q4 results and press release also reflect the impact of the allocation of a portion of expenses to Principal Activities based on revenue, and shift these expenses away from private, public, and capital markets based on head count. This impacts fee-related earnings as these reallocated expenses have historically been included in the calculations. Before I walk you through the impact of these changes, let me walk you through our results. Turning to page two of the supplement, you can see that the underlying performance across our carry paying funds was quite strong. In the middle of the slide, you'll see that NAXI, Asia II and Europe III had solid years, marked up 22%, 32%, and 9% respectively. Our Special Sits and Mezzanine funds also performed well against a backdrop of a tough leveraged credit market environment, outpacing the U.S. high yield and HFRX Special Sits indices for the year. Focusing on total segment financials, the 38% quarter-over-quarter increase in fees is mainly attributed to two things. First, management fees were up 7% in the quarter, largely related to Marshall Wace, the final close of our Europe IV fund, and management fees that turned on as capital was deployed in public markets. Second, it was a step-up in both monitoring and transaction fees, including KCM fees. The bump-up in these fees was partially a result of an increase in equity invested in private markets, primarily in European and Asia investments, as well as activity at First Data, including its IPO, together with three re-financings executed in October and November. Moving to performance income, our private equity portfolio was up 4.8% and 14.2% for the quarter and year ended December 31. This was the main contributor to a quarter-over-quarter increase of $500 million in total reportable performance income. On a realized basis, our final sale of Smuckers and realized carrier received from the distribution of Walgreens stock from a co-investment entity created at the time of 2007 Boots transaction, coupled with smaller partial exits at Lake Region Medical and SunGard, drove gross cash carried to over $200 million. Shifting to investment income, let me first talk about overall investment performance at a high level. Page three of the supplement highlights balance sheet investment performance, and as you can see, our investments were marked down 1.3% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we're up 3.3%. The quarterly result was driven by unrealized marks taken in some of our direct energy and credit investments, which were not immune to the meaningful reductions in commodity prices and the stress felt across leveraged credit markets in the quarter. Our CLO portfolio specifically was marked down $90 million on a net basis in Q4. Overall, though, despite the volatile environment within energy and credit, and the broad market volatility experienced in the second half of the year, full-year performance outpaced the MSCI World by over 350 basis points. Turning to a few details, for the quarter we reported an investment loss of $176 million. It's worth pointing out that $81 million net realized loss was driven by the crystallization of a write-off of our investment in EFH, which for segment reporting purposes was $100 million. While we've had this investment marked at zero for some time, the conclusion of our investment in EFH led us to realize the loss this quarter. This realization, and the reversal of the unrealized loss previously reported, has on a net basis no impact at all to ENI. Slide four lays out some key activity within the balance sheet in 2015. There was a healthy level of monetization activity for the year, driven by realizations in our private equity portfolio, in addition to $800 million of realizations from our credit and CLO investments. Our balance sheet was also active, deploying roughly $2.7 billion of capital. Some of the more noteworthy activity during the year included our strategic partnership with Marshall Wace, seeding a new real estate vertical, buying back our shares, investing opportunistically in WMI Holdings, and continuing to anchor many of our investment vehicles with GP Capital. Shifting to expenses, occupancy and other operating expenses remain largely flat year-over-year, while compensation and benefits grew modestly. In light of the Q3 and Q4 mark-to-market activity, our pre-tax ENI margin for the year was approximately 45%, below our goal of 50% to 60%. Let me now touch on AUM and fee-paying AUM, as Scott is going to circle back and talk about our progress here in a couple of minutes. We've been discussing the impact of our pro rata portion of strategic partnerships and shadow AUM for some time now, and beginning this quarter, our reported total is reflecting inclusion of both of these figures. We believe the inclusion of shadow and AUM provide a better picture of our capital raising efforts and future fee and carry potential. And since the profits from our pro rata strategic partnership interests have always been reflected in our financials, we felt the inclusion of that in AUM and fee paying AUM is an accurate reflection of how we view these partnerships. In Q4 AUM, on an apples-to-apples basis, increased $8 billion to $120 billion. This increase was primarily attributable to activity in public markets, most notable of which was the closing of the Marshall Wace transaction, and the pickup of a pro rata portion of their AUM. We also showed a billion of net inflows within our credit business, and Prisma contributed over $300 million of net inflows as well. The bump in fee-paying AUM is largely attributable to Marshall Wace. So far we are very pleased with our progress at Marshall Wace. We closed on this strategic partnership and our 24% interest in early November, and since announcing the partnership, your AUM has grown nicely, with strong underlying performance for their investors. The partnership is off to a very strong start. Finally, given the reallocation of certain expenses against investment income, we've changed how we calculate fee-related earnings. For the quarter, fee-related earnings of $181 million was higher on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis due principally to the First Data transaction activity discussed earlier. For consistency, we've included on our website re-cast financial information dating back to 2013, which reflect the impact of this new methodology and all the updates we've covered today. You can also find fee-related earnings detail on page 16 of our press release. As for 2016, under our new expense allocation methodology, our trailing revenue calculation results in an allocation of principal activities of 23% of relevant expenses versus the 25% figure used for our 2015 results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. We realize there is a lot going on in the markets, but please stop looking at your screens for just a few minutes and focus on what we have to say. I'm going to hit two main points today: the fundamentals we're seeing in our businesses, and why we think this environment is great for us. On the fundamentals, almost everything we are seeing is positive. Our investment returns are strong, our portfolio companies overall are performing well around the world, our deployment pace is high, and in some businesses like credit and infrastructure at record levels. We've been monetizing a number of investments, which activity has continued into the first quarter. And finally, our fundraising success continues. If you put all this together, we're pleased with the fundamentals we're seeing across our firm and businesses. Let me take each of these in turn and give you bit more detail. I'll be referring to slide five of the deck. Let's start with the most important metric for a firm like ours, investment performance. Bill walked you through the numbers. We're generating strong investment performance and the performance is broad-based. This is due to the fundamentals across our portfolio. Performance in our private equity platform remains strong. Trailing 12 months revenue and EBITDA growth are 8% and over 10% respectively. This compares to negative revenue and EBITDA growth estimates for the S&P 500 for 2015. This is by design. Our job is to pick industries that will perform better, targeted companies within those industries that can perform better, and partner with management teams that will make sure those companies do perform better. The result should be a portfolio of companies with top and bottom line growth meaningfully ahead of the market itself. And that's exactly what we're seeing. Let's talk about Asia in particular. Our Asia portfolio companies continue to perform well overall, with trailing revenue and EBITDA growth both in the mid to high teens. The reason for this, to the credit of our investment teams, is that our investments are typically in the more value-added part of the service sector in Asia, like food safety and healthcare, and companies focused on the growth of the middle class. These end markets are still growing, and we've leveraged our global footprint to help portfolio companies like Haier and Panasonic Healthcare growth through cross-border M&A. As a result of this strong portfolio company performance, our Asia II private equity fund is off to an excellent start, with a gross IRR since inception over 35%. It is a top decile performing fund for its vintage and compares to negative IRRs since inception for the MSCI Asia indices. So let's turn to deployment. As you can see on slide six, we deployed $11 billion in 2015 across our businesses, and the activity levels picked up in Q4 across the firm. In private markets, our investment activity increased over 50% from Q3, including the highest deployment quarter to date for our infrastructure business. And in public markets, gross dollars invested also increased about 50% from Q3, to $1.7 billion, the highest deployment quarter we've had. This deployment activity should not be a surprise. When things get cheaper and companies need help, we tend to deploy more capital, especially in areas like credit and infrastructure. On to monetizations. Realizations were down in the quarter, as you'd expect, but two things to note here. First, we saw a meaningful increase in the percentage of our PE portfolio that is publically traded, through three IPOs and our taking back stock in two strategic sales. So the overall percentage of our PE portfolio in level one securities increased from 32% as of September 30 to 42%, setting ourselves up nicely for future monetizations. And second, despite the choppy environment, we've actually seen a number of monetizations in 2016, through two sales in our Asian private equity portfolio, a recap at U.S Foods, and the sale of one of first investments in our flagship real estate fund. Now, on to fundraising and business building. In Q4, our Special Sits II Fund closed on an additional $980 million of commitments. We also held closes on the successor to our first mezzanine fund and our first European direct lending and European real estate funds. The best way to look at our progress here is to look across the year. Take a look at slide seven. In total, we raised $20 billion of assets organically in 2015. Over $16 billion of this came from outside of private equity. As a reminder, these 2015 numbers do not include our latest Americas private equity fund. As a result of this fundraising activity, for the first time our fee-paying AUM in public markets exceeds that in private markets. And looking further under the numbers, PE now represents about 38% of our total fee-paying AUM and 43% of our AUM, significantly less than five years ago. I know this all may seem a bit counter-intuitive given the market backdrop, but it's important to understand. Now let me shift a bit to why we like this environment of fear and volatility. Look at slide eight. Remember, the vast majority of our capital is locked up for a long period of time. Over 80% of our management fees come from funds or relationships with over eight-year contractual lives from inception. When you are an investment firm with locked-up capital, it is great news when things get cheaper. We generate most of our excess returns by making smart investments in markets like this one. Also, it's important to understand that we've built our business model specifically for markets like these. Our capital markets business and our balance sheet are weapons that are especially powerful in this type of market. Our capital markets business allows us to access equity and debt capital directly, to get deals done when others can't. And our $13 billion balance sheet allows us to step up for larger checks and syndicate down later. The combination of these two is very powerful, as we can move quickly and in size when traditional financing is not available. Combine these factors with our locked-up LP capital and we have a powerful model that can invest in dislocated markets and move in when others are scared. And then we can monetize those investments later, when the markets swing back from fear to greed. In effect, we view markets like this one as giving us a great opportunity to create options that we can monetize in a more optimistic environment. And our model positions us to create more of those options when fear reigns. So we're actually quite bullish on what we're seeing and our ability to monetize this environment. And with a record $29 billion of dry powder, plus our balance sheet, we have ample capacity to express our views. You can see the details on slide eight. So let me run through a couple of examples of how this works in practice. I'm going to begin with a private equity investment that we announced in January to be funded out of NAXI, Mills Fleet Farm, which is a family-owned Midwestern value-based retailer. As we completed our diligence towards the end of 2015, we continued to be enthusiastic about the investment opportunity, which has a similar thesis to successful investments for us like Dollar General, Academy Sports, and National Vision. While we were finishing our diligence, we could not get a reasonable financing proposal for what amounted to $815 million debt financing. But instead of signing up for an uneconomic debt commitment or walking away from the opportunity altogether, our capital markets team got to work. Through the direct relationships we've developed over the course of the 10 years we've had this business, we marketed the debt component of the capital structure directly to end buyers and arranged the first lien and second lien debt together with a revolver as sole arranger on meaningfully superior terms relative to what was being offered to us by traditional financing sources. Basically, we just did it ourselves. Since the deal was announced, we've received multiple inbound calls from other sponsors finding themselves in similar situations and asking for our thoughts and help, further driving our third-party capital markets business. And one of these in particular looks like it's coming together, and I expect we'll be working as a 50-50 partner on syndicating a similar size debt package for another private equity firm, providing a new investment opportunity for our credit business and a fee opportunity for our capital markets business. Our capital markets platform gives us a competitive advantage. And this becomes particularly evident when markets are dislocated and capital sources dry up. Markets like this also allow us to monetize complexity and creativity to an even greater extent. An example is the joint venture we formed with the two largest Italian banks, Intesa and UniCredit. We jointly launched a platform to provide long-term capital and operational expertise to Italian companies in stressed or distressed situations. Basically, under the JV, Intesa and UniCredit contributed a loan portfolio to a KKR-controlled vehicle, and we'll contribute capital out of our credit funds at our discretion, together with expertise to work out these non-performing loans. Through this arrangement, the banks were able to address the NPLs on their balance sheet while maintaining exposure to upside as situations are worked through, while we're able to earn an attractive priority return on our invested capital. It's an exciting and creative JV. As you can imagine, this took an extensive amount of work with both banks, in addition to multiple regulatory and governmental bodies within Italy and the ECB. And it's been exciting to make the first series of investments out of our funds in Q4. More broadly, we view this partnership as a first step in helping to find creative solutions to the €2 trillion European NPL opportunity, and as you'd expect, are leveraging the technology and experience acquired through this transaction in thinking through future opportunities. We'll keep you posted as we move forward on other initiatives like this. Hopefully, these brief examples serve as a reminder that our business is different. We have built our business to monetize environments like this. We make sure our entire firm is working together to creatively provide capital to companies in need, and we have the long-term funds, facilitating capital markets business, and permanent balance sheet capital to ensure that all of us as shareholders benefit from the great opportunities dislocated markets afford those with the conviction, capital and critically long-term perspective to lean in when others won't. This is what we do and this is the type of environment when we distinguish ourselves. With that, we're happy to take any questions.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR for further comments. Please proceed.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks Brian. I was just going to note, just looking at the queue, looks like we actually have quite a few people in the queue. So if everyone wouldn't mind limiting your questions to one question and a follow-up and then get back in the queue, we'd appreciate it. So with that, let's – why don't we go ahead, Brian. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Good morning guys, thanks. Real quick on that case study you just gave, Scott. When you syndicate a $850 million package like that, what kind of fee would we expect to come through the capital markets business?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well it's really going to depend, Patrick. First, it was $815 million, and to be clear, the way some of these will work – and so it's impossible to give you a precise answer that will apply in every situation. In some instances, we'll originate something like that, we may hold some of it in our credit funds, or we may syndicate all of it. Sometimes we hold all of it and sometimes we syndicate all of it. So, the short answer is, typically on what we're underwriting to syndicate, we'll get a fee of 2% to 3% on the syndicated portion. But that will vary from market to market. But in this market, that's typically about right. And in an environment like this one we may be able to do it a bit better than that.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. That's really helpful. And then my follow-up is on the fundraising. You noted the seeding of real estate credit, could you give us an idea of the pace to raising an actual third party fund there? And also, do you have any more visibility on a target size for the real estate Europe fund?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Real estate credit, I don't have an update for you yet. Probably have one next quarter. We're in the process of working through how we're going to fund that strategy, whether it's going to be a fund or a different type of more permanent capital vehicle, but those conversations are ongoing. And in terms of real estate Europe, we're in the market; I would tell you our first-time funds tend to be in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, give or take.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research: Great, thanks. Good morning. Big picture question, I think clearly investors are worried about an implosion of credit in China and the potential need for China to recapitalize its banking system, devalue the currency, and the implications of that for global risk asset prices. I think it's a view you share, to a degree, based on Mr. McVeigh's commentary on your website. And I think, of course, most of that is still to come, but you also cited record deployment in the credit business in Q4. So, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about managing risk and navigating the global macro pitfalls as you ramp up deployment in credit.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. I think first, Luke, on China in particular, it's important to understand, we have not done much in credit in China to date. We actually just announced a joint venture which will hopefully set us up to be able to take advantage of what is happening in China, from a direct lending standpoint and otherwise. But our exposure in China today is on the private equity front and in some real estate, but relatively small, and those companies, as I mentioned, are performing well. I'd say more broadly in credit, in terms of the deployment opportunity, it's quite broad-based. One of the great things about this market environment, we are seeing significantly enhanced pipelines in direct lending, mezzanine and special situations on a global basis. Part of that is in Asia, which will be in effect the fallout from the slowdown in the Chinese economy on companies and countries outside of China. But the larger percentage of it is the U.S. and Europe. And so I mentioned the deployment is up significantly, the capital raising is up, our dry powder is at the highest levels ever, and we feel really well positioned to take advantage of that, and that's everything from senior secured direct lending to middle-market corporates in the U.S. and Europe, all the way through to rescue capital for companies on a global basis.
Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research: Okay, thanks. And then from a capital management standpoint, I'm wondering what your thoughts are around the CLO book that came in with KFN. I think there's some debate about whether that book provides you with a sufficient return on capital, if the capital tied up might be better deployed to accelerate share repurchase. So I was just hoping you'd comment on whether you plan to wind down the CLO book, and if you do that, would it be through gradual maturation or would you actively sell a big chunk of it?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Good question. So if you go to page four of the deck we prepared, you'll see on the bottom left that we actually have been monetizing assets in the CLO portfolio and the credit portfolio. So you can see, between the two of them, the better part of $800 million came back last year, and that is – some of that's natural runoff, but most of that is a purposeful decision on our part, Luke, to monetize and call some of these older CLOs, and redeploy capital into a lot of the things we're doing on the right hand side of that page, including share buybacks. I think you continue to see us call those older CLOs as market conditions allow us to. We are at the same time issuing new CLOs, which is bringing in asset management revenues. But in effect, when we did this KFN transaction, we said we would seek to monetize that portfolio and put it into higher returning opportunities, and we're in the process of doing that.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And on the newer CLOs, what we're typically doing is just investing in the sub-notes, and providing just enough capital for risk retention. Obviously we are raising significant CLOs and have been over the past year, and the economics on putting up a small amount of capital and receiving fees on the entire CLO is quite attractive.
Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research: Okay. Thank you very much.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Yup.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much, I appreciate it. Just a couple questions, just sticking with the capital management, just want to take that one step further. As you think about where stock is trading today versus some of the opportunity to put more into work around the world, you mentioned the volatility. How do you sort of stack rank that right now, and so you made good inroad into the initial $500 million? How are you thinking on the other side of that right now, as well, in terms of incremental repurchase potential?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Bill. It's Scott. So, as we mentioned, we did the $500 million authorization last quarter, so we've spent $270 million of that $500 million, away from the other $30 million that Craig took you through. So we have about $230 million left. We think that this stock represents extraordinarily compelling value at these prices, so we'll be actively buying the stock as soon as we're able to after these earnings are out. And then we'll address the question as to reloading the buyback authorization in due course. Our message at the time we announced it was that we wanted to control our share count dilution. That is still very much something that we're committed to, but we're glad we have the buyback in place and we'll be actively using it, and then we'll come back and let you know when we're ready to reload.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Second question is on margins, and Craig had mentioned that you came in a little bit – or maybe it was Bill – came in a little bit shy of your, so your margin goal for the year. How much of that might have been just sort of some sticky spending, given all the growth in the business, versus maybe just dealing with the market dynamics, and how you think about that as you look into 2016?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Bill, this is Bill. Some of that was capital that we spent to jumpstart some of these businesses, but that isn't a big number. Obviously what happened is, with the markdown of our balance sheet in the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you're looking at a total revenue to total profitability, to the extent that you have on a mark-to-market basis some write-downs in a particular quarter, your margins are going to shrink. But again, based upon performance, and we've been now a public company in the past six years, we feel pretty comfortable that we're going to target, on average, a margin of anywhere in between that 50% and 60%.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. This is Mike Needham in for Mike Carrier. So first, just on – you gave the trailing 12-month revenue growth for your portfolio companies somewhere in the high single digits, and then EBITDA growth in the low double digits for last year. Did that trend hold up throughout the year, or was there some decline?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Mike, it's Scott. I'd say the overall trend has held up quite well. The places where there's been a little bit given back would be the places that you'd expect. So, think of the U.S industrials portfolio to some extent has slowed a bit. But those numbers have been in the range of 8% or 9% top line growth and 10% to 12% EBITDA growth for the last several quarters. So, nothing that I'd call out in terms of meaningful move.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great, thanks. And then on expenses for 4Q, I appreciate the disclosure on the reconciliation details for the new FRE number. But then just on overall expenses, can you give us an idea of what's sort of the pick-up on a sequential basis in 4Q on the core expenses of cash comp and G&A? And then the full year wasn't up as much, so it could be some true-up for 4Q, but should we expect that to moderate in the first quarter, or is the new base is going to be a bit higher? Thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Mike, what you should look at – you hit the nail on the head, is really year-over-year. And so, when you see the increase in operating expenses, it was up a little less than 2%. What happened in the fourth quarter, there were just some expenses that tend to come in in the fourth quarter. So if you're comparing fourth to third, it always looks like there's a little bit of a jump. But on a normalized basis, when you go year-over-year, we've done a pretty good job of managing expenses. As far as cash comp is concerned, it was up in this particular quarter only for the fact that a lot of the cash comp is driven by fee income. So fee income was quite robust in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015, and that's why you saw that increase.
Michael Needham - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Can you guys tell us what percent of your energy investments right now are income-positive with commodity prices where they are, excluding hedges?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: I don't know if we can answer that question specifically for you. But maybe we can give you a little bit of a context though, that might help you frame the – your thinking about energy exposure, and then we can follow up offline. But just to frame it, direct energy for us is a very, very large – a small percentage of our overall exposure. So, to put numbers around, if you look at our credit AUM, it's less than 3.5% energy. If you look at our private equity portfolio, it's about 2% energy. And if you look at our balance sheet in terms of its exposure to direct energy, it's about 6%, 6.5%, give or take. So it's a very small percentage of our overall third-party AUM and our overall balance sheet. And in terms of the actual investments that we still have, in terms of the vast majority of those are cash flowing. Keep in mind, what we're left with in terms of our energy income and growth fund are largely unlevered positions in natural gas assets or oil assets or in the royalty or drilling space. But to date, they're performing reasonably well given the commodity environment; we have hedges in place for most of those. And what I would point you to in terms of focus, as you think about marks on that 2% to 6% of our assets, depending on how you look at it, is really what matters is what happens with the forward curve three years to five years out. It's basically a DCF base valuation, but that's going to have the biggest impact.
Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Follow-up question then on the CLO portfolio. Right now, it's valued at 69% of cost, and I'm not sure how that compares to the broader levered loan index, I think it might be below perhaps where the levered loan index is; maybe you guys correct me if that's wrong. But wondering what's in there where the value's so below cost. I mean, I know that there's been a drastic blow-out in high yield and so on. But it seems like there might be a fairly high degree of risk in this particular portfolio of investments, and maybe you guys can shed little bit light on that?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, happy to. So, some of this is structural, Chris. You have to understand how these CLOs are structured. So on average, our CLOs are levered at about five times. And so, just to give you a sense for how to think about it, the LSTA, so the loan index in Q4 was down 2.1% in the quarter. Okay, so all else equal, you would have expected our equity underneath five-times-levered CLOs to be down 10% to 11%. We were actually down 8% in the quarter, because the underlying portfolio outperformed the LSTA index. So really when you look at the face of the press release, what you're seeing there is the mark on the equity underneath the CLO structures. So you should not compare that mark as a percentage of cost to where the index is trading; you'd almost want to take the index, multiply that by five or six to get a feel for the relative comparison in terms of that math. But really what's happening even further, and I won't get too much in the detail here because it gets complex quickly, is we have some older CLOs from KFN that are – that we've called and are running off, and some of those positions we're in the process of monetizing, and some of those traded down in Q3 and Q4. And then we have a number of newer CLOs that we've done on the basis of risk retention only in terms of our hold and the equity underlying those CLOs, and those are performing quite well. So there's a lot going on underneath the waves, but the punch line is, we're monetizing the old stuff and the new stuff's coming on. And if you look through the portfolio on a 100% basis, the overall performance of the portfolio has been quite good relative to the index.
Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Couple of things. First, you highlighted WMIH in this release. And I'm wondering – as a balance sheet investment – and I'm wondering, is that conceived of as a vehicle for investing or co-investing in an ordinary private equity type investment, or is that a strategic tool for strategic parent company investments, or how – what should we expect to see there?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Chris. It's a great question. So WMIH is actually a NASDAQ-traded entity. And think of it this way. It is the old holding company of Washington Mutual, which has a meaningful NOL. And so – and there's lots of public disclosures that that entity puts out, so there's lots that you could find out about it. But the punch line from KKR's standpoint is, we view it as a very interesting tax-advantaged vehicle for us to make some kind of strategic acquisition for KKR, in the financial space or otherwise, through that vehicle where we would have an ownership position in it. So in effect we've got a tax-advantaged vehicle through which we have the option of going and doing something interesting with balance sheet capital. So, I would think of it almost as a tax-advantaged SPAC that we can use to go do some interesting things. It's not a client account, to be clear, it's actually a public company.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then sort of as a follow-up to that, I mean, as I remember, KFN debt extended out like 20 years or 23 years, or it was long, long time debt. And if you are running down and selling the CLOs in that, does that mean you can take the capacity – the debt capacity, that long-term non-recourse debt capacity in the old KFN, and deploy it wherever you want?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. The short answer is yes. This is Bill. The one thing we've got is, we've got flexibility in that; we've got KFN, which is 100% owned by KKR and it's got its own debt and that debt is recourse to those assets; and then we've got KKR proper, with its own leverage. And so, to the extent that we could use that debt to our advantage, we have the ability to fund investments in either the KKR proper balance sheet or through KFN.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Hey, great. Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the perspective around the capital markets business and how that can disintermediate the traditional financing streams. And so, question is really, how does that impact the timing of deals, and are you capacity constrained? Meaning that if you have to rely even less on the traditional financing markets moving forward, does that reduce the volume of the transactions you can move forward on at the same time? Just trying to get a sense of how that's going to impact the pace of deal flow.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. It's a great question, Devin. So I would answer it in a couple of different ways. One, in the first instance I would think more holistically about the firm. So when the traditional lending markets get more difficult, as we discussed before, we love that volatility, because what that does is provide an opportunity for us in our credit business from a deployment standpoint. And so a lot of companies, a lot of sponsors can't get financing; that creates a lot of deployment opportunity for us in credit in the first instance. And so you've seen those deployment numbers continue to kick up, and we've seen that business continue to grow. On private equity, it's a little bifurcated right now. So the U.S. market really pulled back pretty dramatically in the fourth quarter, and Europe was more open for new deals. So in the U.S., there's no question, right now it's a risk-off environment. Markets are starting to open up a little bit; some of the deals that were originated in Q4 are starting to come back to market. But the stories need to be really simple, and it needs to be a well-known sponsor, but if there is any complexity, it's very difficult. But the base case here is that new deals in the U.S. are going to be done under the Mills Fleet format or directly syndicated. We think that there is quite a bit of private capital out there. We know, because we work with a number of those counterparties in a lot of different instances to be able to finance these deals, but there is clearly some capacity constraint associated with that market. And so you can get a $1 billion or a $2 billion deal done; It's not clear, you can do dramatically more than that in this environment until the regular way market opens up for buyouts. So KCM is a huge weapon, because we can actually get those deals done, where I think it's more difficult for others to do that. It's great for credit, but it may capacity-constrain us a little bit on the U.S. PE side until the markets open up in a more traditional manner. Europe is a bit different, frankly. It's more constructive as a market, it's more stable. Deals are actually getting done. And so €1 billion plus transactions are doable. Still need the right credit and the right sponsor, and the secondary market in Europe is starting to pull back a bit, but the European market is not as dislocated as the U.S. So hopefully that color is helpful.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah, that's very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up to those comments. I'm just trying to think about some of the differences between what you're seeing in valuation spreads from maybe the publically traded markets to the private markets right now, and how that's influencing the capital deployment thought process where you're seeing better opportunities?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Look, the bottom line, this is great. I mean, what tends to happen in an environment like this, valuations come down and the deals that we do in these types of environments tend to be our best deals. And so there may not be as much volume in PE that's done, but the deals that we do get done are done at a lower valuation, lower leverage; then the financing markets open back up and you're able frankly to put a different and longer-term capital structure in place in some instances. But the biggest driver of return in a lot of these transactions is getting an entry valuation that's very attractive, then creating operational improvement at the company, and then exiting at a time, as I said, when we've kind of swung back from fear to greed. And if you look back to what happened in the 2008-2009 period, we had a number of excellent transactions done during that period of time, because we were willing to lean in when everybody else was running the other direction. And that's why I say we love volatility, because it provides those types of opportunities. And so you'll continue to see us be judicious and patient, but when we find something we really like and there's an opportunity to move forward, we'll be able to do it because we have the capital and the teams are ready.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay. Thanks for getting me on. First, now that you're retaining more capital, just wondering if your thinking has changed at all as it relates to M&A, either from a strategic standpoint or as it relates to financial criteria? And then, how do you see the dynamic of lower valuations, broadly speaking, playing out, versus maybe a bit more competition from buyers?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. So Michael, on the first one, just to clarify one thing in terms of our being one quarter into our new distribution program, we've actually retained less capital, because we spent more on the combination of the dividend and buybacks than we would have on our old distribution policy. So, that's – you are right in the long term. We have the potential to retain more capital, but we've actually chosen to change the mix of how we're using our capital to do buy-backs, and the fixed distribution obviously. And so the short answer, it hasn't really changed the way we're thinking about M&A in this environment. We've mentioned that most of the businesses that we're in today, we would expect to grow organically as opposed to through acquisition. We've got some opportunities like WMI that we talked about that could be interesting to do some things from the non- – inorganic standpoint, but no change in thought process there. And in terms of lower valuations, look, what we find is in the M&A market, when valuations go down, there is sometimes a bit of a lag, so it will take some time for a seller to be comfortable selling at a lower valuation. And the private and public markets tend to sync up in relatively short order. But we haven't seen any real change in competitive behavior as of yet. It's odd, but you know, what often times happens when valuations go down, strategic buyers may pull back a little bit, so we may actually see a bit less strategic competition. But you really need to have courage to wade into these types of markets. Strategics sometimes pull back, and that can create opportunities for us, because there's a bit less competition at lower valuations. The real question is what's the catalyst to do something in an environment like this? And we need that kind of catalyst, which is why it's helpful to have distressed plus private equity, and be able to operate in both types of situations.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. That's helpful. And then as it relates to Marshall Wace, can you just kind of walk through plans to leverage synergies from a distribution perspective, as you look across sort of the respective LP bases? And then I know it's still early days, but any initial thoughts on how you might partner with them from a product extension standpoint?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. Not a lot to report out yet. I would say on the distribution front, we've got our teams talking to each other and working together. Not a lot of overlap in our client base, and so we do see some opportunities to help them, and we see opportunities for them to help us. And that's off to a great start. And on the joint product side, we're working through a number of different ideas together. A bit early to give you any specific update, but we'll keep you updated in – along the way.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Good morning.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I was just sort of – maybe go on to page five, I'm just thinking about fundraising, just trying to get maybe an update on – I mean, as you talked about, it's going well; I guess had some first closings and Special Sits has done well. But could you update us on kind of your various – what you're thinking about as we look to the year ahead, in terms of fundraising capacity on existing strategies, kind of what you think is doable? And then also, I guess, as part of that, where things are with the new North American fund?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure. Happy to take that. So I think in terms of – as you think about what's happening in the year ahead, handful of things I'd point you to. One is, we'll be finishing up our Special Sits II fundraise here in the first quarter, so I'd expect by the time we speak again we'll have an update on a final close there. The big dollar amount for this year, in terms of the main event, is our Americas XII private equity fundraise, so that's a flagship American – Americas PE fund. We are in the market with that fund right now, and it's early days but going quite well. Then you've got a series of other funds that we'll be in the market with. REPA II, which is the successor to our opportunistic real estate fund, we'll be in the market with that. European Direct Lending and European Real Estate, as I mentioned, we're still fundraising there. I expect those will finish it up this year. We're in the market with the successor to our Mezz funds. So, Mezz II or what we call private credit opportunities II, we're in the market there. And we're in the market with Growth Equity on the tech front. So those are the more episodic vehicles that we have in the market right now or over the course of the next several months. And then on top of that, as you know, we've got our hedge funds, Prisma, plus a number of direct products that the Prisma platform is launching, Marshall Wace, Nephila, et cetera. And then in credit, high-yield, leveraged loans, separate accounts, CLOs, other SMAs; on a continuous front. So a lot of activity across the board. I'm not going to give you a number in terms of an expectation for the year, but each of the last couple years -- last few years we've been kind of the $15 billion to $20 billion (53:17) range a year. And that was without having an America XII in the market. And so we think that that will be a big component of what we raise this year. The fundraising environment continues to be quite good. Investors have a good amount of cash. We have not seen the market volatility impact investors' behavior as of yet. So right now, we've got a lot of good things coming to market at a time when people seem excited to put money to work.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. That's actually probably segued into my follow-up. If it was possible to – it was interesting getting some update on, it's been on your success and expanding your LP base, it's been a goal for, I guess since you went public, more or less, before that, and maybe update us on where that stands in terms of with your new funds, a sense of how much of that is -- are investors new to KKR or existing clients, re-upping or taking on multiple strategies?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. Happy to give you color on that. So as you'll recall, back in 2008, we had about 275 productions and everything that we did. And we had set a target of getting to 1,000. As of year-end, we are at 895, just about at 900; that's up about a 100 year-over-year. We went in effect from 800 to 900 in the course of last year, Robert. And so we're seeing nice progress. And that 100 new per year has been pretty consistent the last two years or three years. In terms of cross-sell, that continues to be our biggest opportunity. Right now we're at about 1.7 products per client, but to give you a sense, our top 40 average number between three and four products. We think this is a big opportunity, especially when you look at the fact that about a third of our clients are in more than one product. So there's a big opportunity for us to continue to build our client franchise and earn their trust, but then do more – earn the right to do more with those clients that are working with us already. In terms of the re-up statistics and – or what new clients mean, just to give you a sense, across Special Sits, through Infrastructure II and Asia II, somewhere between 40% and 50% of the clients in those funds are new clients to KKR. They'll tend to be a smaller percentage of the dollars, because new clients tend to start a little smaller, but it's a very meaningful percentage of the clients, and somewhere between 25% and 50% of dollars for new funds – successor funds tend to come from new clients for the firm.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, folks. Just to the – back to the deployment backdrop, maybe Scott, if you can talk a little bit more about – also trying to sort of understand the pace of that, given the dislocation in the markets. In which areas do you think there are more attractive opportunities, near term? And then going back to the comments that you mentioned on the ability to syndicate financing in the capital markets, how do you think about that from a capacity perspective on your balance sheet? And then in your funds, if the environment is indeed something that you wanted to accelerate the deployment, what's sort of the capacity to do that? I guess, just a bit more of a broader view as well, of how long you think the dislocation will last?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Got it. You snuck a few in there.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sorry.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Let me try to take them in turn. In the slide deck, we actually have a chart that's probably worth taking a look at. We referenced it quickly, on our dry powder. So if you go to page eight, you can see at the top half of that slide that our dry powder is now somewhere between $29 billion and $30 billion. You can see it's up 40% year-over-year. And if you go to the right hand part of that, the slide, you can see how it breaks down between asset classes. So as I said, we feel great because we are heading into this market of dislocation and volatility at the same time that we have a lot of capital with which to work, and those are all record numbers for us. So we feel really well positioned. In terms of where we see the opportunities, it's quite broad-based. I mentioned several times that we see opportunities in credit. I'd say probably last year the opportunity set was more on the private credit side. Now we're seeing enhanced opportunities in private credit, and also increasingly in what we call leveraged credit. The high-yield and leveraged loan markets are starting to dislocate. There's opportunistic credit opportunities. We see those opportunities clearly in the U.S. today, but increasingly we're starting to think that Europe's coming our way and there will be more to do in credit in Europe as well, not just in the private side, where the opportunity has been in place, but also in the more liquid markets as well. I'd also point you to areas like infrastructure, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, where we're seeing more opportunity to work with municipalities and governments in terms of buying their assets, or working with strategics that need capital for development opportunities and otherwise. So infrastructure, U.S. and Europe, would be another opportunity set I'd point to. Private credit – private equity, excuse me, continues to be a really interesting opportunity. Volatility definitely creates opportunities in that business. We are finding some non-traditional opportunities like Mills Fleet, but we are, we think, well positioned to be able to take advantage of lower valuations. Europe, PE, the opportunity is coming our way, there's a lot of pain in the financial sector. But there is activity picking up in new deals. And then Asia, while we're a bit cautious given the volatility, we are seeing opportunity come out of the volatility. And I'd point you to places like Japan, where we've done some corporate carve outs and think there is more to do there, some cross-border deals, Chinese services is a theme we like a lot. So private equity also continues to be interesting. Real estate credit – and I'm sorry to keep going, but it is really broad based right now. Real estate credit, very interesting opportunity as the traditional lending markets and real estate are impacted by the dislocation and the volatility, a lot to do there. And then opportunistic real estate is also an area where we see, especially at the smaller and midsized part of the market, there's just less capital there than there used to be, and we're creating pools of capital and investing our Fund I right into that supply-demand imbalance. So it's quite broad based. I'll stop there; I could keep going. Obviously there's a lot of capital needs in energy. There's a lot of capital needs in lot of markets around the world. But we're seeing deployment opportunities globally across asset classes, at the same time we have a lot of dry powder. In terms of the balance sheet and your question there, I would say the balance sheet is committed to all of the strategies that I just articulated. And so we will continue to draw down those balance sheet commitments as those underlying funds get invested, but there's nothing that I'd point you to there in particular. We are trying to make sure we have enough liquidity to take advantage of what we think are going to be some really interesting opportunities coming out of this dislocation. And so we want to be able to be liquid and opportunistic, and that's one of the best things about having our permanent capital base is we should be able to do that. And in terms of the, how long the dislocation will be here? I'm going to avoid trying to make any guess for you as to how long we're here. It does feel to us like we've got bit of time for this to play out, and we are suffering now from a handful of negatives. It was concern about China and oil, and now more recently there's much more anxiety about European banks, and I think there's an overall concern about a lack of liquidity in the market. Those are the big four. We don't see concern abating on those four fronts anytime soon, which is what makes us so optimistic that this is going to be a really interesting deployment environment for us for at least the near term and potentially the medium term.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And Brian, just to give you a little color – and this is just on private market side. We've, right now we've got approximately $2.5 billion of deals signed up which will probably close in the first quarter and second quarter. And to run down into some of the numbers, we've got about $700 million signed up in U.S., about a $1 billion in Europe, and a few hundred million in Asia; we have a couple of hundred million signed up for energy and real estate, real estate credit, and approximately $400 million in infrastructure. So across all the platforms in private markets, based upon what we see today, the deployment pace, at least over the foreseeable future, is going to be quite robust.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah. And just as a follow-on, just imagine – I'm sure all of our shareholders who are listening – that all of your capital was locked up and could not be taken away for 5, 10-plus years. I mean, that's kind of why you hear the optimism from us that this is a great time for us, because if you had the locked up capital, you'd be to be pretty excited about making investments in this environment, where assets are down in some cases 30%, 50% plus in two or three months, where we don't think the fundamentals have really changed. And that's why we're so upbeat.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. It's certainly a learning – and then on the – especially with the balance sheet capacity and that as a strategic tool for you guys. I guess, considering all of those opportunities and also that your stock's very cheap, maybe just a quick comment on how you view that, versus upping the buyback from the $500 million?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, we don't really have to answer that question, as of yet, because we still have the capacity under the initial $500 million. So, but obviously, we are looking at the trade-off in terms of investing in our own stock versus investing into this market environment. And we just look at our stock as like any other investment opportunity. And so we'll continue to do that trade-off. We think our stock has really extraordinarily compelling value at these levels. But we also are seeing other investment opportunities come our way and become much more compelling it seems day by day. So we'll continue to do that relative trade-off. As I said, we'll be active buyers in the market in our stock next week. And we'll continue to do that trade-off and tell you what we're seeing on a relative basis and how we think about it. But right now, we see opportunities in both.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.

Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: My follow-up was asked. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hi. You mentioned that the realized losses were from crystallizing EFU, and I wonder, is there more to go on that and Samson, and what's the process of realizing those losses that you've got already fully written down? And what impact will it have on DE and ENI and all of that?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Chris. This is Bill. With regard to EFH, the investment is now written off completely. So as it relates to our funds, as it relates to our balance sheet, everything is done as we look at EFH. As it relates to Samson, we've written net investment down to zero. However, we haven't written it off. So from a cash earnings point of view, when that company emerges from bankruptcy, and we may not receive any equity, at that time we'll have a realization event from a cash earnings point of view. But – I don't want to overemphasize this, but I want to. The impact, when Samson comes out of bankruptcy and we write the investment to zero, if in fact that's where we end up, has no impact to ENI, because all of the pain on the write-down of that investment from inception till today has already been taken through the P&L. So, again, no impact to ENI when we have a crystallization event for Samson.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): But it would show up in the DE calculation?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: It certainly would.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: And that number, as you probably know, because we reported this as a separate asset probably five, six quarters ago, is roughly about $250 million on the balance sheet.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And so – and that would be a tax benefit that flows through to the unitholders, though?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Very good point, yes it would.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, you used to give us – you mentioned that there were a couple of realizations already in the quarter, and I realized you no longer have the – you no longer give the – you no longer do a distribution each quarter based on that. But if you were under the old method, roughly how much of distributable earnings would what you've already monetized year-to-date – would that kick in?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: It would only be a few cents. So, Scott had mentioned that we had two monetizations in Aegis so far, and one dividend recap in the U.S., but back of the envelope – and I did this yesterday – we're talking about $0.03 or $0.04.
Chris M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, the conference will open for questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Amanda. Welcome everyone to our third quarter 2015 earnings calls. Thank you for joining. This afternoon I'm joined by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, our Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOs in addition to Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. Before we get underway, we would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. And this call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. This afternoon, we've issued a press release with our results for the third quarter and like last quarter we've also posted a supplementary presentation on our website that we'll refer to over the course of the call. We do have a broader agenda to review with you this afternoon. As you've likely seen in the press release and as highlighted on the second page of our supplement, we've announced a change in our distribution policy from the variable policy you are all familiar with to a fixed distribution of $0.16 per quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, which would be paid in 2016. In addition, our board has authorized a $500 million share buyback plan. Our thinking on these changes are pretty straightforward and I'd like to point you to the third slide, excuse me. First, we think it's important to remember that employees own or control about 45% of KKR, so the natural alignment here is quite clear. Second, the best way for us to create equity value over the long term is to participate to a greater extent in everything that we do. This includes the investments that we make and this includes owning even higher percentage of our stock by implementing our buyback program. And finally, we have a financial profile that allows us to support a fixed distribution that today implies an indicated annual yield that's over 50% greater than the S&P 500, while still allowing us to invest more in everything that we do. In terms of our agenda for the call, Bill, is first going to review our results for the quarter. Henry, will then introduce to you the rationale behind the change in our distribution policy and buyback authorization. Scott is going to focus on our business model and what this means for all of us looking forward, followed by George, who will provide some closing thoughts before the Q&A. And with that, let me turn it over to Bill to walk you through our results.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Craig. Let me first touch on a broad market volatility we saw this quarter as our ENI was impacted by the mark-to-market changes that ran through our financial statements. Within equities, the S&P 500 and MSCI world indices were down 6.4% and 8.3% respectively for Q3. We've not experienced a quarter where both of these indices were down more than 5%, since the third quarter of 2011, which was the only other quarter we reported negative ENI since being a public company. And at the same time the benchmark loan index, the LSTA was down 1.4% on a net basis in Q3, the worst quarterly performance of the LSTA in four years. In the high-yield fund and HFRX special sit indices were down 4.9% and 8.7% respectively. It was a challenging quarter for the markets. Against this backdrop, we reported negative ENI after-taxes of $315 million, driven by unrealized losses within both performance income and investment income. While we care and care a lot about ENI, as a management team we focus on the firm's broader performance, rather than results for any 90-day period. Remember, 75% of our fee-paying AUM is locked up for at least eight years at inception. This provides us with the ability to selectively and strategically enter and exit investments at points in time that we view as attractive. We are not for sellers. Turing to the broader underlying performance of our funds, these results are quite good. Slide four of the earnings supplement provides a snapshot of investment performance for the quarter, as well as on a year-to-date basis across our benchmark carrying paying funds in both private and public markets. Of particular note, I'd like to highlight when you compare the year-to-date performance of our North America XI, Asia II and Europe III funds shown in the center of the page against the S&P 500 MSCI Asia Pacific and MSCI Europe indices respectively, our benchmark funds have outperformed these broader market indices by over 2,000 basis points, 2,200 basis points and 1,400 basis points respectively. And at the same time, overall real assets and alternative credit funds continue to perform. Slide five of the deck shows our balance sheet investment performance in 2015. While the investment income line in our press release is reflective of a 2.3% mark-to-market decline in the investment portfolio on the balance sheet in Q3, on both the quarterly and year-to-date basis our balance sheet returns have outpaced the MSCI world index by several hundred basis points. Focusing on cash flow, we reported total distributable earnings of $349 million. The biggest component of it is realized carry generated from the sale of Alliant to Stone Point and Capital Safety to 3M, dividend recaps at Academy and WMF as well as our final secondary in Nielsen. On a blended basis these exits were done at a multiple of 2.5 times our cost. Taken together with fee and balance sheet income, we've announced a Q3 distribution of $0.35 per unit. Looking at our AUM and fee paying AUM as of September 30, our assets under management were $98.7 billion and our fee-paying assets under management were $82.9 billion. Keep in mind, these figures do not reflect nearly $11 billion of committed capital that will be included in AUM once it's invested and at a blended management fee rate of about 115 basis points. This figure has grown by $1 billion since last quarter. In addition, it also does not include the AUM from our strategic partnerships. Most notably here in September, we announced the strategic partnership with Marshall Wace, which George will touch on in a few minutes. In terms of the partnership's impact on our financials, although it won't close for another week or so, we will show our 24.9% equity interest pro rata within our public market segment upon closing. And on a pro forma pro rata basis, including Marshall Wace, the AUM from our strategic partnerships is approximately $9 billion. Finally, beginning in Q4, we plan to adjust the presentation of our results to include a new fourth segment. Principal Activities. We believe presenting our balance sheet activities separately is a better framework through which to evaluate our performance. Now, as part of this, we'll be allocating a portion of our expenses directly against investment income. As most of you are aware, while investment income generally contributes to a meaningful portion of our total revenue, our fee income currently bears the burden of almost all of our non-carry pool-related expenses. Ahead of next quarter, we plan to post to our website a more complete picture of these changes, so there won't be any surprises when we get on the Q4 call. In addition, we anticipate adjusting our AUM and fee-paying AUM disclosures to include both shadow AUM, as well as the pro rata portion of our strategic partnership efforts. Page six of the deck walks you from reported AUM to adjusted AUM, including our pro rata stake in Marshall Wace. As you can see, both shadow AUM and our pro rata portion of our strategic partnerships has grown meaningfully in significance over time, with adjusted AUM standing at $118 billion on a pro forma basis as of September 30. And with that, I am pleased to turn it over to Henry.
Henry R. Kravis - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill and thank you, everyone for joining our call today. Given the announcements we've made this afternoon, George and I felt it's important to walk you through our thinking and the path forward for us strategically. Now I expect there is a good deal of interest, specifically in the change of our distribution policy and the introduction of our share repurchase plan. So, let me begin there. Simply put, we've been investing and generating strong returns for nearly 40 years. We continue to have many growth avenues. Page seven of the supplement shows our progress since we've been a public company. Assets under management have grown from $52 billion to $99 billion or over $118 billion on an adjusted basis. Our book value per unit has increased $6 to $12, while we paid out 75% of our cash flow or about $7 per unit and our market cap has increased from $6 billion to $15 billion, and we've expanded our product set. We view KKR as a growth company and we think we will create more value for shareholders by investing our cash flow into what we do every day. The changes we're making reflect this vision. We'll still pay a healthy distribution that is now fixed and we'll have more capital to invest behind our ideas, including repurchasing our own stock. We think our shareholders will do better and since we own or control 45% of the stock, we will do better as well. Over time, we think that the market will value what we do with our balance sheet including repurchasing our own units more than the variable distributions we've been paying. Now let me explain these thoughts a little more completely. As we thought through this, we kept coming back to four observations. First, we think we have an excellent investment track record, which includes our balance sheet investment performance. Performance here has exceeded the MSCI world in four of the last five years, as well as on a year-to-date basis, and from an IRR standpoint has delivered a 17% return since we've been a public company. Knowing this, we think our shareholders will be better off today if we kept some of that capital and seeing it compound on our balance sheet at those rates. The power of compounding is incredible. Second, we're at an inflection point as we think about the growth profile of the firm. We launched a number of first time funds over the last few years and we've only begun to feel the impact as several of these begin to scale. Obviously, this is incremental to the growth of our core private equity strategies, including the Americas, where I expect to see larger pools of capital in the future. Third, we don't think our current distribution policy maximizes long-term value for unit-holders and finally when investors have been selling our stock at levels we think are compelling, we've not had a buyback plan in place to take those shares off their hands. So, we're making two changes with a long-term view in mind. First, we're implementing a fixed distribution of $0.16 a quarter, which based on last night's closing price implies a 3.6% indicated annual yield. In addition, we've authorized $500 million share buyback plan. And to be clear, we think actions speak louder than words. We will be buying back our stock when we think it represents value for our shareholders. In terms of the distribution itself, a $0.16 per quarter is not a distribution that will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Like most corporate America, this is a fixed distribution that we'll evaluate on a regular basis. We sized the $0.16 to approximate our recurring quarterly cash flow, which means quarterly distribution is not only all reliant on our ability – it's not at all reliant on our ability to sell investments over any 90-day period. And most importantly, we believe that this will allow us to retain capital, compound value in the balance sheet, buyback our stock and increase our earnings power per share. The buyback program is particularly noteworthy and important to us. We believe in this firm and we believe in our future and we want to have the flexibility to strategically repurchase shares and control share count and dilution at the same time. As Scott's going to walk through what this can mean for all of us going forward, but before he does, I'm going to spend a minute on our people, our values and our culture because this is what makes KKR special. There are two things to emphasize. First and most importantly, we're one firm. We work together collaboratively and relentlessly to create the right solution for our company. We train our investment professionals to be solutions oriented and product agnostic, bringing all the expertise and resources available at KKR to every investment situation, while putting our investors first. Our incentives are aligned in this manner, most significantly everyone is paid on how well KKR does, but the one firm team oriented nature of KKR is deeper than this, it's out DNA. Second, we care deeply about our people. We want to attract diverse professionals who are team oriented, innovative, entrepreneurial self-starters, and you're going to rarely hear anybody at KKR use the words me or I, this is by design and having the right people with the right culture and values is critical for us when you think about our integrated business model. Our goal is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns for our fund investors and to use our business model to maximize the economics from these returns. To do this, we all need to work together, think creatively and collaborate. Our one firm culture with silos facilitates this. So with that, let me turn it over to Scott to expand on these thoughts.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thanks, Henry. We think it's important to remind everyone of who we are before we can tell you where we're going. So, I'm going to focus my comment on our business model. Our business, when you think about it, is fundamentally about investing well. We are an investment firm. We manage third-party capital, in addition to our own capital on the balance sheet and we have a capital markets business alongside. Our revenue comes from fees, carry and balance sheet investment income. Bill discussed some changes in our disclosure going forward. I want to expand on this a bit. 20% to 25% of our total revenue generally comes from our balance sheet, and our investment professionals are focused across all of our businesses to maximize firm-wide revenue. Historically though, we have not allocated any of our direct expenses, including compensation, against balance sheet revenues. Henry discussed how we operate as one firm, with everyone working together to maximize total firm revenues, fees, carry and balance sheet. We run the firm to an overall margin calculated by deducting total firm expenses from total firm revenues. Going forward, we will be sharing that calculation with you as a significant part of our disclosure and messaging. On page eight of the deck using this calculation and approach, you see our pre-tax ENI margin over the past few years compared to the average of several alternative asset managers with more AUM-centric models, all on a total segment basis after deducting stock-based compensation. We think with our model, third-party AUM plus balance sheet plus capital markets, we have a better mousetrap. And in a normalized environment for every dollar of revenue that we generate, we expect to see about 50% to 60% flow through the ENI. Obviously, this is going to vary over any 90-day period, but over time, we think it's a useful guidepost. Through the first six months of the year, we were at 61%, through nine months we were at 50%. So, we've been operating within this span. The third-party asset management part of our business and our capital markets business are pretty well understood. But we also have a balance sheet that invests in everything that we do and is a critical part of our business model. Long term large dollar compounding is the eighth wonder of the world. The power of compounding, as Henry said, is truly incredible. A dollar invested for 10 years at a 15% return, turns into over $4. At a 20% return, the dollar turns into $6.19. So let's focus on this math and the power of compounding applied to our business, and what it mean for KKR from a book value and an earnings power standpoint. On page nine and this is important, you see the historical performance of our balance sheet investments. The investment portfolio outpaced the MSCI index in every year except one, 2013, when it still returned 23% and from an IRR standpoint, since 2010, it's returned 17.2%. While we've made our fair share of investment mistakes along the way, the overall performance of our balance sheet portfolio has been quite strong. Let me transition to return on equity. We know it's not a popular metric to look at in the asset management space generally, but we think it's an important metric to look at for any business. And we think it's an important metric to look at for ours, especially as we further scale our balance sheet investments. The way we measure it is pretty simple, it's income from our resources, fees, carry and balance sheet over our average equity. Basically, if you were to break up the ROE, you'd earn a component from balance sheet investment performance, plus an incremental 500 basis points to 1,000 basis points from fees and carry. Since 2010, our total ROE has averaged in excess of 20%. Reflect on that a moment. We've been averaging a 20% firm-wide ROE for the last almost six years with little net debt at our firm. We really like our business model. Balance sheet investment performance and total firm ROE are obviously linked. Our overall target for any 12-month period is to generate double-digit returns off the balance sheet, which combined with our fee and carry streams, should translate into a mid-to-high teens firm-wide ROE. We will review our progress against this goal with you on a regular basis. Through six months, we were on track with these targets; through nine months given the volatility and marks we've taken we're off that track and have some work to do. Now let me put this all together and frame how the announcements today fit within the framework of our business model and why we are convinced this is the best path forward as we look to create equity value. Page 10 takes our balance sheet performance one step further and ties back to something that Henry talked about earlier. In 2014, under our old distribution policy, we paid out $1.90 per unit in distributions, or almost $1.5 billion. If instead, we had paid out $0.16 per quarter or $0.64 for the year, we would have retained roughly $1 billion of capital to invest more behind our ideas and to buy back shares. That's $1 billion of incremental capital for investments and buybacks in just one year. If we re-imagine our past in this manner back to January 1, 2010, distributing $0.16 per quarter over this period and reinvesting excess proceeds at historical return levels, we would have grown our book value per share to $15.45 or 18% growth per year and the end result would have been about a 30% increase in book compare to where we stand now, or approximately $3 billion of incremental book value. In terms of what this would mean for our earnings, if we had $3 billion of incremental book value at a 15% return on equity, we would have an additional $450 million of annual earnings. And importantly, we would have had the opportunity along the way to further increase book value per share through opportunistic buybacks. Of course, there's no assurance of what our actual returns would have been, but we like our business. We own or control over 45% of the firm and we want to retain more capital to invest in opportunities we find attractive, including our own stock. Please turn to slide 11, which gives a snapshot of the go-forward opportunity for us. As of September 30, our book value per unit was about $12. Let's talk about how this could grow going forward. A minute ago, we discussed our actual book value per share compounding at a 13% rate since 2010, during which time we were distributing about 75% of our cash flow. We also discussed 18% book value per share growth if the new policy has been in place since the beginning of 2010. But to illustrate this, let's be more conservative than the hypothetical 18% compounded rate. Let's say you believe we will only compound book value per share at 13% going forward. That would suggest in five years, we have a book value of $22.13 per unit and in 10 years, it would grow to $40.77 per unit, so over 1.8 times our current level in five years and 3.4 times our current level in 10 years. The 18% compounded rate would imply a book value per unit considerably above this, as you can see on the slide. Now we've said our target is to earn a double-digit return on our balance sheet and to see this translate into a mid-to-high teens ROE on a firm-wide basis. So you think we'll achieve an ROE at the bottom end of these targets. So, 10% from our balance sheet with our total firm ROE being 500 basis points higher as you layer on our fee earnings and carry streams for a 15% total firm ROE. That would suggest in year five we would have after-tax earnings per unit of about $3.30 and in year 10, it would be over $6 per unit. In five years, at a 10 times to 12 times PE, the stock price would be $33 to $40 per unit compared to $18 today, resulting in an IRR between 16% and 20%. If you think our book value per unit can in fact compound at a faster rate through higher investment returns and our buyback program or if we can achieve a total ROE in excess of 15%, the IRRs could expand meaningfully from here. Of course, what has happened in the past is not a guarantee of the future, but I hope this gets a point across. We are investors. We have built a business model to monetize our investment performance. The changes we are making today will help us compound significant value per share going forward, while we continue to scale our third-party asset management and capital markets efforts. If you believe in our ability to generate investment performance, the math of our model is very powerful. Now, let me turn the call to George for some final comments.
George Rosenberg Roberts - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: Thanks you, Scott and thank you everyone for joining this call. We are trying to solve a series of simultaneous equations; I am referring to page 12 of the deck. Our goal is to invest well and we are laser focused on doubling our equity value, doubling our stock price. At the same time as we grow, we want to control our head-count and reduce the complexity that could come with growth. This is important not only from a margin standpoint, but also to help maintain the culture of the firm, which Henry spoke about. We are committed to controlling our share count, we're mindful of the share count creep, this is a long term objective. As we have in the past, it would be critical for us to perform at a level where we keep an attractive return on equity, while maintaining our modest leverage profile. So, how we're going to do this? I think the items we need to accomplish are pretty straightforward. First, we're going to continue to expand our investment management business in a disciplined and profitable manner; this remains critical for us. The growth opportunities from a product standpoint are plentiful with some of our newer businesses like real assets, alternative credit and hedge funds and this is in addition to the growth we see in our private equity business. And in terms of fund raising, we will continue to build on our high net worth channel and liquid alternatives. Continued strong investment performance in our funds will drive results and help us achieve those goals. Second, we're going to grow our capital markets business across all that we do. We've done a good job getting to where we are today, but there are even more opportunities across our businesses and we can take the business even more globally. And finally, in terms of balance sheet, we need to perform and increase the earning power of our company. The balance sheet gives us the flexibility to do things that you cannot, we can buyback our stock, control our share count, we can invest alongside our funds through direct co-investment opportunities and in some instances, like First Data, do so meaningfully. We can take sizable positions in companies where we have long-term conviction and see significant upside. We can invest behind new strategies, like we did when we established our real-estate platform. We can see new platforms, pursue partnerships, pursue strategic M&A, we can create long-term strategic partnerships like we've done with Nephila and more recently with Marshall Wace. And we will continue to support our strategies through key commitments to our funds, which align our interest with LPs and ultimately strengthen our fund-raising efforts. Let me touch on the Marshall Wace strategic partnership. We forged a strong relationship with the founders Paul Marshall and Ian Wace, and expect this to be a mutually beneficial partnership in an area, liquid alternatives that is fast growing strategy and with our presence historically limited. In closing, we'll have an initial 24.9% interest and as a mutual option over time to increase this to 39.9%. We think there are number of opportunities to work together with Marshall Wace, cross marketing through our respective LP base, joint marketing opportunities, particularly for those LPs that are interested in pursuing broader style partnerships, the introduction over time of new products that marry both liquid and illiquid strategies and joint opportunities across multiple segments in the credit markets given our current footprint in credit, as well as Marshall Wace presence in the fast-growing peer-to-peer sector. This partnership will be accretive to our earnings per share upon closing and I should add that during this volatile period, Marshall Wace has continued to grow and the strategies have delivered strong investment results for their clients. We recognize that our business model is different than the other alternative asset managers, this is intentional. Scott walked you through the math. You don't need to make the heroic assumptions to understand the opportunities that we see. Let's look at the final slide of the deck, slide 13. Turning it back to our announcement this afternoon when you cut through it, we think the best way for us to create equity value over the long term is to invest even more in what we were doing on your behalf, to invest even more before our ideas (31:55) and buy back our stock to control our share count. And all of us at KKR are aligned as we go down this path. Remember, that employees own or control 45% of our company. Our overall strategy of this firm has not changed. We're going to continue our focus on growing our asset management business, expanding the capital markets franchising, compounding book value per share and increasing the earning power of our firm. To reiterate what Henry said earlier, over time, we think the markets will value what we do with our balance sheet, including repurchasing our own units more than variable distributions that we've been paid. We've been in this investment business for nearly 40 years at KKR. When Henry, Jerry and I started, we were guided by the fundament principle that aligning interest and being patient with locked up long-term capital would be a powerful combination and yield positive results. We believe it still does and that it will in the future. With performance, execution within the growth avenues open to us in our third-party business and the power of compounding, we will have more capital to turn into more value for all of us.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, George. And with that we like to open the line to any questions. Now, before we begin it does look like we already have quite a few people in the queue, so if everyone could please ask only one question and then a follow-up if it's necessary and then rejoin the queue, we would appreciate it. So with that Amanda, we'll take the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate the enhanced disclosure. I guess just sort of stepping back and certainly appreciate Henry and George being online as well, how did you arrive at sort of the dynamics to which you are presenting this evening, sort of curious. So the $0.16 dividend, what was sort of your thinking behind that? And then as you're thinking about buyback, how is the market going to understand the pace of that buyback? I think the market's probably a little confused right now based on how the stock is trading after market, just about sort of the give-and-take between the balance sheet growth and the actual return of that capital. So, just trying to get a little more clarity of how to think about that buyback in some kind of specificity.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Bill. As it relates to coming up with the distribution itself, as you know, we've been reporting fee and yield earnings for the past seven quarters and that is what we like to look at as our more recurring fee stream. If you go back and figure out what the average is over the last seven quarters, it roughly comes out to be anywhere between $0.15 and $0.16 and so we were comfortable that, that was going to be a floor where we could continue to pay that out without having to worry about trying to gain any extra economics from either balance sheet sales or carry. As it relates to the stock buyback, Scott?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, look, I think, Bill, the highest level we kind of came at the conclusion that the variable distribution was not going to ultimately get valued. So, let's pay out the very recurring portion of our earnings and that's the $0.16 per quarter, $0.64 a year, as Bill said, we've been run rating. And then, let's take the excess cash that we generate and do thinks with it that we think will get valued in the market over time. We took you through the balance sheet performance we think making investments off the balance sheet will create value over time and we think buying back our stock will create value over time as we can compound on a per share basis. Giving you specificity around the use of the $500 million, how fast we're going to use it? We'll see. We'll see how the stock trades. But our view has been, as Henry said, that looking at the course of last several quarters we've been very nice to have a buyback authorization in place, given how the stocks perform. So you should expect to see us using it. The pace we'll get back to you and let you know how much we use how quickly. But we expect that we'll be using it.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just my follow-up on that. Is this a potential precursor toward a C Corp? Because I think one of the advantages of the PTP structure is sort of shielding that cash flow from carry. And obviously you are making a bigger statement about obviously opportunity to reinvest the capital as well as the fixed dividend. Is there any advantage at this point to retaining the PTP structure? And if so, what would that be?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Bill, for the time being we look at alternatives all the time. We're quite comfortable with our structure as it sits today, although things could change. Thank you.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, just to follow-up on the shift in capital management, I get the thinking behind the stock is a good value down at these levels, but I thought one of the rationales for buying in, the KFN portfolio a little over a year ago, and really kind of doubling down the balance sheet, if you will, was so that you could invest more behind your ideas. So now it seems by moving to a fixed distribution, the message you are putting out is that you want to – you want more capacity or at least you want to put that capacity to work more quickly to invest behind some of these opportunities that you are seeing. Is that kind of the right way to think about it from that perspective?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Michael, this is Scott, I'll take it. Look, I think in part, yes, but really If I were you I'd step back and say you are right. When we bought KFN, we said let's have more assets on the balance sheet, it will give us more fee and yield earnings. So we have a higher predictable base which we are now going to be paying out in the fixed distribution on a go-forward basis and we will have more capital that we could redeploy into higher returning opportunities, which as you can see on page nine of the deck, we've been doing that. So, we've been selling down some of the old legacy KFN investments and rotating into higher return opportunities. But if you step back even further, what we are really saying and I gave the example using 2014, is last year we paid out $1.5 billion in dividend, on a go-forward basis it will be between $500 million and $600 million. That $1 billion of excess cash flow that was paid out in the variable distribution we were paying, we're thinking we can create more value with that $1 billion by doing two things. One is to invest in opportunities and generate the types of returns you see on page nine, and the other thing is to buy back our stock and to be clear obviously we are buying back our stock from the public shareholders only. So, a bit over half of the stock is owned by the public. So, if you use a $500 million buyback and you think about the aggregate cash that was going into investors' pocket versus it's now, it's really not a big shift, we were just changing it from distribution to buyback.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon, guys. Sticking with the theme of the day, if I think about your change in capital management strategy, I mean at the end of the day, it's really adopting a more traditional strategy distribution that kind of follows cash generation earnings over time, reinvesting the business – whether you are building widgets or investing to compound growth and share repurchase where it's attractive. So, should we also think that this $0.16 kind of distribution if you continue to grow your third-party business and are successful, that we should really just thinking of this in a more traditional sense that there should be growth in that base distribution that maybe mirrors your book value growth over time?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Rob, this is Bill. You're thinking about this correctly. We're coming up with now a fixed distribution and as we continue to grow the business and we perform, you can expect that that number would go up, but right now we've come out with $0.64 for the very short-term, we're not going to change that. But again, if the business performs and we don't have additional uses for the capital that dividend could increase for sure.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Probably just one quick follow-up? I know you just mentioned you are going to have the new segment reporting. I'm just curious, are you going to maintain most of the current metrics that you report in terms of DE, FRE and yield earnings?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Rob, we'll continue to report that information plus we'll also provide supplemental information and really try to lay out exactly how we're running the business as well, so we'll provide both.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yes, I think we'll be including kind of numbers like pages five and nine, Rob. So, it'll give you better sense for the aggregate balance sheet performance also.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): I can't resist the topic of the day either. So I mean, if we look at your distribution last year, it was around $1.90, the year before, $1.40, and we had you on track to high $1.60s this year. So I figure on average it was like about $1.70 and that's about $1.5 billion and that was roughly 75% of your cash distributable earnings overall. And if we look at the $500 million buyback and add the distribution, it adds up to more like $1 billion rather than $1.5 billion. So, should we think of it that way roughly that you are thinking in terms of a 50% payout between cash and distributions? Or is that not the way that you looked at it?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I think the way we looked at it, Chris, to be really clear is kind of going back to what I said before. We think the market will value the more fixed component of our earnings and that's what we put into the fixed distribution and we are saying we are going to treat it more like a normal corporate dividend, so regardless of what we earn we intent to pay that. And then the excess over that amount we said that we thought that could create more value by investing more behind everything that we do and buying our stock. I think the point that as you think your way through the $500 million buyback, that's really just applied over the public shares though, because if you're going to do your math and you say $1.5 billion used to go out in total, if $750 million rough justice used to go to the public and $750 million to KKR, then now we've got $250 million going to public through their half of the dividend and the buyback would be entirely used for the public shares, so you get back more or less to $750 million to the public investors, that's the bigger point.
Christopher M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up, looking at in your deck on page 15, it looks like in most years, your – or last couple of years, your kind of the share creep from issuance, I guess, has been like 10 million to 15 million shares. Is the intent of – and $500 million would be more than enough to offset that. And I guess I think a lot of companies out there when they talk about share buybacks, what they end up doing is only offsetting employee issuances as opposed to actually shrinking the share count. And I wonder what your intent is there.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I think you've got the math right. We certainly have the fire power to more than offset the amount we use for annual compensation. And I think I would just go back to George's remarks that we've said is a strategic goal for ourselves to control our share count. So, you'll continue to see us use it and it's a long-term objective for us to grow book value per share and the overall share prices and so that's not one year objective, it's a long-term objective.
Christopher M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, all right, thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good evening. So I'm going to change up the topic here and move over to fee-earning AUM. It's really been ranged down to the past two years here. And I'm just wondering, kind of given the puts and takes around capital-raising operations, do you expect fee-earning AUM to start to grow in the intermediate term? Or are we really waiting on North America Fund XII here to really accelerate things here?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Craig, this is Bill. When you take a look, during this quarter we actually brought on about $3 billion of AUM, but keep in mind that we've got approximately $11 billion that is committed that under the – certainly on the public market side, we only get paid a fee and a carry when that capital is invested, and so, as capital gets deployed certainly on the public market side, you are going to see a ramp up in AUM and fee-paying AUM. Likewise, as you know we are out raising several funds and we would think that based upon the good performance we have with a lot of the funds that we have taking our latest North America fund being in the top quartile that when we go out and raise that successor fund, we would hope that that fund might be larger than the last. Scott, any more color you want to add.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, the only thing I would add, if you look at the last 12 months, Craig, we've kind of raised $15 billion plus $6 billion of new shadow AUM. So as Henry said, we are kind of at this inflection point, we have a number of strategies where we are raising second time funds, we've talked in the past about infrastructure with two or three times the size of one, direct lending two, three times the size of direct lending one. What's been happening over the course of the last couple of years is we've had a lot of monetizations in private equity. So your observation is right, we have been scaling these new business, but private equities has been bringing it down, but if you look at what we have in the market, I will just list it, America XII, our second real estate fund REPA II, Europe IV is finishing up fund raising, Special Sits II is still in the market, Direct Lending Europe, Real Estate Europe, our second mezzanine vehicle our private credit opportunities II, growth equity plus our hedge fund and continuous credit offerings. So we have a lot out there, so I think it's bit of a shift in the overall mix and the dynamic, but my sense is over time as we get into more of a normalized monetization environment in PE and these newer funds come on, you will start to see it move up.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just as a follow-up here, because North America XI has about $4 billion left to invest, do you think it's likely Fund XII will be a 2016 at capital raising event or more like 2017?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, we are in the market right now with America XII, so I would expect that we are raising capital over the course of the next 12 months plus.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Right. So we'll be raising capital through 2016 and probably in the front-end to 2017 and obviously that fund won't turn on until most of the capital is deployed in North America XI.
Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks, everyone. I guess just another question on the shift in the distribution strategy. Yes, I guess it's a couple-part question. But one is, if the balance sheet is growing like our LPs, are you okay with that? Two is just when you think about the shareholder base of yourself but also the sector; I don't know if you've done any analysis in terms of how many investors are in it for the yield or the income, and what turnover you expect? And then when you think about the cycle, you use like 2010 to 2015 to come up with some of those returns. It's been a good five or six years. Now granted you used 18% and 13% on the math. So we can use a lower kind of return basis. But just wanted to get your thoughts, when you think about deploying that extra cash that you are not paying out, as you get later in the cycle, are the odds of more buybacks, even more than offsetting dilution, picking up when the valuations in the market are more full, versus obviously when things start to come under more pressure, you have more opportunity to actually invest in the balance sheet. Just want to get your sense on from a cyclical standpoint, how you think about that. Sorry for the multipart, but thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: No problem, Michael. So, I guess let me take them in turn. So the balance sheet growth question, are the LPs okay with it? 100%. If you think about it, we are extraordinarily aligned with our limited partners. We're actually our largest limited partner ourselves. So we're very aligned with them. They understand the strategy. A very large component of the balance sheet is just investing in the same funds in separate accounts that they're invested in. So we spend a lot of time with them. So, yes, they're very okay with it and actually I think they like the alignment that results from it. In terms of the shareholder base question, look, we talk often with a large number of our shareholders and we have talked to people about the fact that as we pay this variable distribution, it's had a nice trajectory. It hasn't shown up in the stock price. And so, I think if you think about what we've done here, we're continuing to have a very healthy dividend on the stock. It's a 3.6% yield. It's 50%-plus higher than the S&P 500. So we think it's very straightforward for yield buyers to continue to own us. There may be some people that rotate out, there may be some people that rotate in, so we'll have to see how that develops over time. We'll have the buyback to use if there are people that want to rotate out because we think the stock is at a compelling level and so we'll be able to facilitate that in part. In terms of the question on cycle and timing, I'd encourage you to think about it more broadly. We used the historical period because that's the time that we have while we've been public. But we have generated, we think, very strong performance through this cycle for nearly 40 years now. And so, we could show you different timeframes going back further. But the punch line is, we'll be able to use the capital we're retaining not only to invest in opportunities that we like, but if you think about what happens when the markets dislocate, things get cheap, it could be a great environment for us to be deploying our balance sheet capital. And if people think we're late in the cycle and they're worried about KKR's earnings power and the stock trades down, then we'll buyback more of our stock and we think we can generate returns from a dislocation in both manners. So if that happens, we think we have ways to take advantage. Henry?
Henry R. Kravis - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, just – this is Henry – let me just add one thing to that, that if you look at our history for almost 40 years now, the more dislocation, the more volatility, the better we've done and now we're in a much better shape than we've been before and that we are global. So, we can invest around the world, there always going to be opportunities for us to put money to work in very interesting segments. And if everything is just going straight up or at a very high price, it makes it much tougher but the fact that there is the volatility, the fact that prices have come down in a number of sectors becomes much more interesting for us. And, obviously, the same thing would be true with our balance sheet that is investing alongside as the EP of all of our different funds.
Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. So you've made a pretty compelling investment case for KKR and I'm just wondering with the stock down here, why wouldn't we want to be even more aggressive with the buyback than you've already laid out and I know there is some float issues, but, look, even $500 million is what 3% of the cap and 6% of the float. So I'm just not understanding why we wouldn't want to be more aggressive on that especially given where the valuation is?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Look, Chris, I think it is 6% of the float which if you look at a number of buybacks, it's probably middle of the fairway, but if we use it all, we can always go back ask the board for a larger authorization. So I wouldn't get too focused on the amount, this seems like a good starting number and let's see what happens.
Henry R. Kravis - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: This is Henry, I'll just add to that and that is that we have to look at that and weigh against all the other opportunities that we have whenever you're buying stock, you look at that and you say, is that a good risk adjusted return for the capital that we have or we better to make an investment in another entity or to buy a company or take a bigger position in one of our own companies. And that's what we're always weighing it against.
Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Understood. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery of AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.
Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I'm going to resume beating the dead horse. It seems like the change in distribution policy is partly that you've reached a breaking point with how the stock was being treated by the market, with the credit you're getting for the distributions. But, just being a little bit cynical, I guess, you could say, you added a corporate agency problem to what's already kind of a volatile business and volatile cash flows and it's unclear I guess how that's supposed to help investors get comfortable with the business model or obtain a fair valuation. So, I think, beyond the value creation you see to buy your stock or reinvest in the business, I get that. How do you think through the potential negative signals to the market as you arrived at this decision?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I guess, Luke, I'm not sure we – I don't perceive a negative signal, I think frankly what we're saying is, we own the better part of half of the company. Whatever we do with the company, impacts the people at KKR to a much greater extent than anyone else and what we're saying is that we think, over time, we can create more value with this capital management policy as opposed to our previous one. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're investors. We showed you on page 9 of the deck how we've been doing with the balance sheet investments. We think we can continue to make good investments and if the world dislocates, that tends to be – to Henry's point, when we make our best investments and we like that opportunity. And we think all of us, as shareholders, will benefit by controlling or reducing our share count if the stock continues to trade at levels we find compelling. So you put those two things together. I'm trying to follow this cynical train, but, from my standpoint, we're saying we just want to invest more in everything we do including our stock and the reduction in the dividend and the shift to a fixed dividend impacts the people at KKR just like it does to all of the shareholders and we're betting on the long-term and we're betting on ourselves.
Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Just maybe I'll take one more stab at it then. I mean the cynical part was before I could see the cash flows, now there is a policy in place that I have to think about whether I'm getting them, but I think the new distribution policy raises a concern that people have around the broader balance sheet strategy and that's we can agree with the strategic and financial rationale of growing the balance sheet. But as you put more of the revenue mix into the balance sheet or if you increase your retained earnings with the new policy, do you think that means KKR's valuation still won't get a fair shake, because the market seems to have this predisposition to value the balance sheet at one-time book not 10 to 12 times PE like you laid out on slide 11?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, I think – look, I think the positive I would give you is, it's now a fixed distribution before it was entirely variable. So you can count on the $0.16 a quarter whereas before it was variable math. The other piece of it that you look at is what we're saying is don't just value the balance sheet, look at the totality of the business model, it's balance sheet plus the fees, plus the carry. And that gets back to the point we're making in terms of the overall return we're generating and the cash flow we're generating. If you look at the ENI that we've been generating over the last several years divided by the book, we generate a very high ROE and we've done that without any leverage. So we think that that business model is quite an attractive one. If we keep doing that, the book value per share will compound and our earnings will continue to grow. And if we do those two things over time, and we'll keep giving you transparency in what we're doing with the balance sheet, we think that will ultimately show up in the share price.
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: Luke, I think that last point is actually an important one in terms of some of the changes – this is Craig – going forward. If you look in our press release, we historically have given lots of visibility in terms of the performance of the private equity portfolio. We're going to give going forward that same level of transparency in terms of the balance sheet investment performance. So, again, the detail we have on slides 5 and 9, which we haven't disclosed consistently except through our calls. And I think, over time, the thought we have is if we're able to perform that, over time, the balance sheet is going to be viewed as a long-term source of value creation for us versus a source of earnings volatility.
Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good evening, folks. Just following on Luke's question about the – and a little bit of your answer to the prior question about the shake out of the investor base on the distribution, how do you arrive at a view of how important the distribution is to certain investors in the stock and then contrasting that with how you think investors will value the amped-up balance sheet strategy?
Craig Larson - Head-Investor Relations: A couple of thoughts on this, Brian. When we look at the shareholder base and how those investors define themselves and we've done all of this splicing and dicing that you'd expect, the largest holders of our stock are value folks, they're growth folks, and they're growth at a reasonable price folks. So your absolute traditional plain vanilla yield-oriented investors are not, despite the yield that we actually have given to the shareholders, is not as high as a growth and value oriented people. Now I'm not also – I'm not trying to suggest that our shareholders don't value having a current yield component or having recognized the yield that we've paid, but when I think of the composition of our shareholder base and who we end up spending most of our time talking to, it is much more highly skewed towards growth in value-oriented investors than it is to your traditional yield-oriented investors.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Look, I think, ultimately, what we're saying – and we think our shareholders will agree with this, as we continue to generate investment performance, better uses of our capital through compounding in the buyback program will, over time, exceed the market value of the distributions we're paying. And what we're saying is let's pay the fixed piece that people can model and understand in the variable component, we'll continue to tell everybody exactly how it's generated. But we think, over time, the market will value it more if we use it for buybacks and we use it to make our own investments and compound faster.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And just a follow up, I mean does this – the fact that you're not beholden to variable distributions, does this change the way you think about timing of realizations in any way to either give you more flexibility to hold on to positions longer through different market cycles or does that not really matter?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: No change. I mean, as I said, we're fiduciaries for our LPs, we'll continue to manage our portfolio and create exits when we think it's appropriate, so, no change in terms of how we think about exits.
Henry R. Kravis - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: And by the way that's the way it has been since we started the firm, we're not tied to any particular time to get out. We really look and see what do we feel is the best time to maximize the value for our limited partners.
Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Hey, guys. Thanks. A bit of a hypothetical, I guess, your two largest positions on the balance sheet and maybe even in the funds are now liquid or will be in the first quarter when the Walgreens lockup comes up, so it's not hard to imagine a cash flow situation next year that significantly better than it has been this year. How do we think about that against this new distribution policy and how you even think about the amount of cash that could coming through the business when that's happening?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, look, I think – thanks, Patrick, it's Scott – the Walgreens stock's performed very well. First Data has also moved up very materially for us over the course of the last 12 months. So, we continue to benefit from both of those holdings continuing to accrue up. As I said in the answer to the last question, I don't think the change in the distribution policy or capital management strategy is going to change how we think about those investments. What we will do going forward and what we've done in the past is take a look at opportunities that we have to invest throughout the firm and compare that to the upside and the potential we see in those two investments. We said in last quarter's call that you're going to see us, from time to time, take some more meaningful positions in companies. Walgreens and First Data are two prime examples of that. But clearly, over time, we sell down those positions which we could, but if we did, we would be able to redeploy that capital into other investments including buying back our own stock. But it does not change at all how we think about the monetizations. We're very excited to be in partnership with Stefano Pessina and Frank Bisignano and we think both companies have quite a bit of opportunity ahead.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: I guess my point – just to ask it in a different way is that the amount of cash flow being generated could be so high, it's hard to imagine that there might be that many opportunities to reinvest it. Is it fair to assume then maybe the repurchase would be amped-up with all that excess cash or that would depend on where the price was obviously?
George Rosenberg Roberts - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: Well, over the last 40 years that we've been in business, we've actually invested $65 billion in private equity and we've actually turned that into $130 billion. So with respect to finding good opportunities in the firm that we have that could invest in many different ways on the capital structure around the world. Finding the opportunities is not going to be the issue for us.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, how you're thinking about the overall yield that you're looking to target to investors on, say, an after-tax basis all-in? Is that something on the specific basis you're targeting?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Well, when you think about the way we're structured, obviously we're a PTP and one of the things that we took into consideration when we analyzed the distribution was that we wanted to make sure that we were going to right-size the distribution to deal with taxable income flow-through for our investors.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And so that reflects some of the changes that you've made. I'm just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more around that.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I think the bottom line, Michael, is that the fixed distribution we expect would cover any tax payments for our investors who are taxable, which, keep in mind, is a subset of our investor base. We have a lot of folks who are not taxable or the way that they look at their returns is on a pre-tax basis, but the yield has been set at such a level that we would expect that it would cover taxes for taxpayers at the highest level.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. So, investors would receive enough to cover the allocated income that they would get?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Correct.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's the plan.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow up, I was just curious if you could talk to some of the compelling investment opportunities off the balance sheet as you see today, I know you've been investing in growth equity, real estate credit off the balance sheet, how are those progressing and what are some of the new product ideas on the docket here? I mean it seems like this change in payout policy maybe reflects maybe a view on your part of more larger investment opportunities ahead?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I'll take it. Look, I think the opportunities that we see, they're abundant and across multiple asset classes. So, we've – if you look to – I'd put page nine kind of in front of you as you look at where we've been generating but where we're seeing deployment opportunities really is, as Henry said, around the world. And so, it's in private equity where we continue to see some pretty interesting opportunities especially in places where there is a bit of dislocation including Asia. We are seeing opportunities especially in the special situations in private credit areas especially areas like Europe where we've seen the banks pull back meaningfully and we talked in prior quarters about the opportunities that we see to step into the breach, whether it's direct lending or distressed, controlled distressed, et cetera. Our real estate business is busy on a global basis including in Europe and so we've created a dedicated vehicle for that. Growth equity is something that, thus far, we've funded off the balance sheet and so we are creating a dedicated vehicle. We may drop some of those balance sheet investments into the fund like we did when we launched our real estate business. So it's really is broad-based. But, in particular, where we see complexity, illiquidity, and dislocation is where we're finding the most interesting opportunities and the volatility of the late summer has created quite a bit of opportunity for us and it's a wonderful thing to have locked up capital to be able to invest behind the opportunities we see.
Henry R. Kravis - Co-Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer: This is Henry. I'll just add one thing to that what Scott said and that is that, we wanted to get ourselves into a position to be a real solutions provider to companies, to be able to invest up and down a capital structure, whether it's equity that's needed, debt that's needed of all classes. And we've gotten ourselves into that position. So, as a number of the financial institutions have cut back on in lending to certain companies or providing capital to certain companies, it's enabled us to have a much more meaningful role and it has created many more opportunities for us around the world. So, when people think about private equity, a lot of people think about it only as buying 100% of the company. In fact, that's not the case at all anymore, it's anything on the balance sheet or in the capital structure that is needed including minority investments that can help a company make an acquisition can delever their balance sheet et cetera. And that's what Scott is talking about as that the numerous opportunities that we're seeing today.
Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks very much. Just a quick question on environment, obviously the market has gotten a lot better in the equity market since last quarter, but I'm still seeing hung deals and inability to get certain deals financed. Just wondering if you could talk to the financing markets and how prevalent some of the issues are that will be super helpful. Thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Sure, Glenn, it's Scott. Look, I think you're right. We're noticing the same thing. The leveraged financed markets in the U.S. getting a little bit more tricky, so the amount of supply coming has increased quite a bit. We are seeing – in some of the smaller deals or nichey deals, we're seeing some deals that get the rates pushed up to get cleared. In some cases, they're not getting syndicated but it's a bit of bifurcated market right now. So, if it's a good quality deal, it's getting down well. If it's a story credit, tougher quality, lot of leverage, then it is much more challenging. And so, it's bifurcation, we continue to see it, and we're watching the supply/demand balance as new deals get announced and the CLO machine slows down in the market a little bit. Europe, it feels like there is less supply that's been created, a bit more of a healthy dynamic, but we are watching the U.S. And any of these – anything that happens especially at the smaller end of the market or where the more story credits creates quite a bit of opportunity for us on our private credit businesses where we've seen our overall deployment continue to increase this year.
Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And I don't want to put words in your mouth, so – but the follow up question I had that you partially answered is, with all the deals that have been announced, say, over the past six months, there is a forward calendar that needs to get funded, you see that as more opportunity than risk, is that correct?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Well, I'd say, couple of things. One, in terms of financing the types of transactions we do in private equity on the new deal front, we haven't seen any material change in behaviors. So we're still able to raise financing for new transactions. At the smaller end of the market, the mid-market and below, which is where do a lot of our work, in our private credit businesses, we are very active because we are finding banks less excited about underwriting those opportunities. What we are finding, though, is if there is a dislocation because the market backs up, and there is a lot of supply and it's hard for the market to absorb, that will be a great buying opportunity for us, both across our leverage credit businesses where we manage more liquid pools and in our private credit business. So that's the entire picture I think.
Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks, guys for taking the question. I know the call is running a little late. So, just one more, I guess, on the pace and timing of the new capital policy. I guess the one thing that's difficult to understand is that at least in the prior methodology, we still kind of knew that while your cash flows might be volatile, 75% of those will be able to get back. So, now when you think about the relative attractiveness of making an investment on balance sheet versus buying back your own stock, how do you, I guess, make that distinction, is that a more formulaic kind of ROE or IRR type of target that you will be considering? Because I do you think ultimately the time to invest on the balance sheet will probably coincide with the time to buy back your stock because they will probably happen simultaneously. So just curious to get your thoughts on that, thanks.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Alex, this is Scott. We're not going to be able to give you a specific formula to point to, but I think you can see the returns we've been generating off the balance sheet and we're looking for opportunities to generate very attractive double-digit-plus kind of returns and we will compare that to the opportunity with our stock. We think, right now, frankly, the stock is at a very attractive level. But as – over time, as the stock price shifts and the opportunity set shifts, we'll keep you updated on how we're thinking about it. We're not going to be able to give you specific math, per se, but we'll tell you how we're thinking about it.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just one for Bill, on the – just on the P&L. When we look at net interest income and dividends for this quarter, there has been a fair amount of fluctuation, I guess, in that line item in general. So as we're thinking ahead, what are the kind of puts and takes of the drivers there and is this a decent enough of a run rate to assume over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Yes, you're right. This quarter, the number was a little lower. And so, depending on the cash flows from the investments that we have in real estate or energy, I wouldn't say they are more seasonal, but they are. And so, what you typically see is a little more cash flow come in in the second quarter and the fourth quarter. But on a run rate basis, when you take a look at that, I would say that number is going to be anywhere between $50 million and $60 million each quarter. And if you take a look at the nine months number, that's pretty close to being spot-on with the $50 million to $60 million cash earnings per quarter.
Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow up question from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Just actually a couple of follow-ups, if I can do so. What were your thoughts as you thought about different strategies, obviously you need to go down this route, but instead of shifting the payout policy of doing more of a levered recapitalization and maybe putting some debt up against the balance sheet and buying in stock without really adjusting the variable, what were some of the mechanics behind that? And perhaps related to that is, what's the multiple you're assuming on the fee paying AUM component of your business when you went through this corporate finance discussion?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Hey, Bill, this is Scott. I'll take that. Look, I think from – the first question, the leverage recap comment, look, I think we've run the firm historically with modest net leverage to zero net leverage. Our perspective is that we have a significant amount of upside through the companies that we're invested in, many of which are levered themselves as you know. And so, we didn't think it was appropriate to add a significant amount of leverage to the corporation at the risk. Actually, one of the slides in the deck we talk about is that simultaneous equation. We don't want to add a lot of franchise risk by adding a lot of leverage at the HoldCo. So, that's the main reason that we decided leveraged recap wasn't something that was attractive. In terms of the multiple on our fee businesses, I think you probably know the answer to that as best we do. I think our observation is that if you look at how we make money, certainly, we have a good chunk of our revenues come from fees, but we have a more meaningful component that comes from carry and from our balance sheet. And so, every time we go through our analysis, it's all connected. Investment return is the most important thing we can focus on and generate. If we generate investment returns, we'll have more carry, we'll have more balance sheet income. It'll be easier to raise larger pools of capital from third-parties and we'll therefore have more fees. So we're focused on what we can control, which is making good investments and monitoring them and making sure that we create real value. And so, that's how we thought about it. And all of that accrues to the positive for all of us as shareholders. So we think of it as, frankly, a more fungible set of revenues where all things benefit from generating good investment returns.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Just one last one. Thanks for your patience. What's been the internal reaction to this, just in terms of is there any pressure on comp? I think earlier on you sort of said you have fee-related margins or probably your pre-tax ENI margins are going to be relatively stable in the range you offered. But any pressure on comp as an offset to what could be some foregone income?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: No.
William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, thanks for taking all my questions tonight.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow up from Kenneth Hill from Barclays. Your line is open.
Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just looking at the credit portfolio on the balance sheet, there's been a few bumps in terms of performance particularly from the CLOs and just a more difficult mark-to-market here this quarter. How should we think about that piece of the business going forward, are you comfortable with some of the levels of volatility you see in the portfolio? And would you expect to maybe size or change the composition of that over time?
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: I mean, I – go ahead.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: No, I was going to say, when you take a look at what happened during this quarter, the LSTA was down 1.4%. We own sub notes in our CLOs and so you're going to see the impact go through on a mark-to-market basis this quarter. But when you take a look at our balance sheet and the exposure we've got to the CLOs, we're pretty comfortable with those positions.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Yeah, the other thing I would do is just ask you to rise up our overall – the leverage credit performed about in line with the LSTA for the quarter. So there's nothing of interest there. But I'd just point you back to page five, the balance sheet performance as a whole down 2.3% for the quarter, the MSCI down 8.3%. So, overall, in any given quarter, you're going to have some things working really well, some things not. We'd ask you to look at the whole body of work which is kind of the overall investment portfolio performance.
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Right. And again, what goes through ENI is mark-to-market.
Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough there. Just a quick one then. From a cash perspective, is there any level of cash you guys need from a regulatory perspective that you would need to either run the business, I guess?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: No
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Nothing material. Maybe in our capital markets business, but it's not a material amount.
Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott C. Nuttall - Member & Head of Global Capital and Asset Management Group, KKR & Co. LP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow up from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP: Thanks for the follow up. It's a quick one. Is there any kind of restriction or quiet period that would keep you from being in the market in your shares tomorrow?
William Joseph Janetschek - Member & Chief Financial Officer: Patrick, we're not going to be able to enter the market until Friday. So we're releasing earnings tonight and we're not going to be able to participate until Friday morning.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to KKR & CO Second Quarter Financial Results. At this time all parties are in a listen-only mode. We will have a question and answer session later on and the instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I would like to welcome our host of for today’s conference Mr. Craig Larson. Please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Carmen. Thank you everybody this is Craig Larson, Head of Investors Relations for KKR. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. As usual, I’m joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO, and Scott Nuttall, Head of Global Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. The call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results. Of note we reported second quarter economic net income of $840 million equating to $0.88 of after-tax economic net income per unit. Both of these figures are up over 40% from last quarter driving by strong investment performance. Total distributable earnings were $491 million in the quarter which translates into $0.57 of distributable earnings per unit net of taxes. And in terms of the distribution we’ve announced a distribution for the quarter of $0.42 per unit. Before we move on I’d like to bring your attention this quarter in addition to our press release we’ve included a supplementary presentation for the first time which is also posted on our website. We thought we would use these slides to highlight the key themes for the quarter as we reflect on our performance and will refer to the pages in this presentation over the course of the call. If you could turn to page two for a moment of the presentation this highlights the four main themes in our business that we’ll expand on over the next 10 to 15 minutes. Strong underlying investment performance, a continued scaling of our newer initiatives, however, continuing to use our balance sheet to invest in our ideas and enhance our growth profile and lastly key initiatives were focused on looking forward. And with that let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial performance in more depth.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. To set the stage for our results let me touch on page three of the earning supplement that Craig reference earlier. As you can see on this page we had strong investment performance this quarter across our carrying paying funds in both private and public market, helping our performance fees. And the performance is broad base. Our three key flagship PE funds were up between 9% and 15% in the quarter. We have also seen strong performance in our real asset strategies, which were up between 4% and 6%. And our alternative credit funds also had a good quarter with Special Sit especially strong returning 6% in Q2. And that investment performance helped drive the results we announce this morning most notably ENI, where we’ve announced record ENI on a total segment basis as well as within both private and public markets. In private markets we reported ENI of $666 million, which is up 17% from the first quarter and 77% on a year-over-year basis. This increase was primarily driven by the continued performance of our private equity portfolio appreciated 7.4% in the second quarter and 11.8% year-to-date. So far in 2015 through June 30th, our portfolio has outpaced the S&P 500 by over 1,000 basis points. Our private market balance sheet assets we’re also marked up, contributing to material quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in investment income. In public markets we report $137 million of ENI, this is also materially on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis due mostly to strong performance fees and record quarterly investment income. Contributed to our performance this quarter includes the performance of our carry funds including our direct lending, mezzanine and special sit strategies, $31 million of realize investment income driven by gains in both liquid credit and Special Sit and we reported $59 million of net interest and dividend, which was up 14% from Q1. Moving to Capital Markets, we reported second quarter ENI of $37 million, up from the $28 million we reported in Q1 driven by higher transaction fees. Our capital market footprint continues to expand globally for our own investment and third parties. For the quarter about 40% of transaction fee activity stem from private equity portfolio companies. Other KKR activity like real estate and energy and infrastructure accounted for 30% while the remaining 30% represented third party activity. Also approximately 30% of the total transaction fees came from outside the U.S. Turning to our balance sheet. Our book value per unit was $12.77, also a record figure for us. Cash and investments on the balance sheet now total $11.8 billion and unrealized carry on the balance sheet is now $1.6 billion. That’s the highest it’s even been which is up 15% from last quarter and 30% from June 30, 2014. All was the result of strong underlying performance seen within our funds. Turning to the distribution we announced the distribution of $0.42. The largest component was $0.18 of realized cash carry driven by the sale of Boimet to Zimmer a secondly Nielsen a secondary Pets at Home a UK listed company, as well as a series of less visible monetizations in Asia including Aricent, Bardy [ph], Far East, MMI and UEL. From a real life carrier perspective we’re up to a good start in Q3 given the recent announcements of the sale of Capital Safety to 3M as well as a sale of the majority stake in a Lion Insurance to [indiscernible] both of which we expect close in Q3. Coupled with the dividend recap at Academy these will combine for roughly $0.12 of distribution per unit in Q3. And when you look at more recurring portion of our distribution fee and yield earnings together with cash carrying balance sheet gains and assuming the transactions I just mentioned earlier are completed we’ll be at around $0.27 a unit for Q3 as we sit here today. Finally in terms of AUM and fee paying AUM as of June 30th our assets under management were $102 billion and fee paying assets under management were $84 billion. And again keep in mind these figures do not reflect nearly $10 billion of committed capital that will be included in AUM once it’s invested. The shadow AUM is up over $4 billion from March 31st, and also it doesn’t include the prorate portion of AUM from our stakes in seeds investment which Scott will walk you through in more detail in a little while. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. As Craig and Bill walked you through, we had a very good quarter. I thought I would focus on the big takeaways for the quarter, share what we’ve been doing on the balance sheet and spend a few minutes on areas of focus and what’s next. The first takeaway from the quarter is that we are generating strong investment performance. Bill ran you through the data on page three, as you can see performance in the quarter was not only strong but also broad based. Let’s turn to page four and dig into the details of our private equity funds. We have executed a number of strategic sales over the last couple of years. In several those transactions we took back stock in the acquirer. Overall those stocks have performed well. In addition we have taken a number of companies, public. The result that we’ve seen a value of the public securities in our private equity portfolio increase from $4.6 billion a year ago to $11.9 billion today and those stocks continue to perform. As you can see on the right hand side of the page, Walgreens is up 14% over the last year, and higher HVA, TRA and GoDaddy are up between 40% and over 100% each. And the $11.9 billion of public securities does not includes First Data which filed its S1 earlier this week. As a reminder we have total exposure to First Data of approximately $4.5 billion approximately $3.2 billion in our funds and $1.3 billion of total exposure on our balance sheet. So PE performance for the quarter were strong. We have line of site to liquidity in the portfolio and the exit environment is good. In our non-PE strategies we are also seeing strong investment performance, good deployment and strong asset flows, which brings me to the second big take away from the quarter our progress in business building. We have discussed for several quarters the opportunity for us to scale the eight more recent platforms we have created over the last several years. On the back of strong investment performance we are seeing that happen. If you look at page five, you can see a couple examples of this, our Direct Lending II fund is 2.9 times of the size of first one. Our Infrastructure II fund which had a final closing a couple weeks ago is $3 billion or 2.9 times the size of Infra I. Our Special Situations business continues to scale as well. Our first commingle fund was $2 billion. We’ve had two closes on the Special Sits II fund at $1.7 billion and we now manage over $6 billion in assets in this strategy. In addition we’re making progress on an adjacent strategy Direct Lending Europe. So we continue to see these newer businesses scale and have a larger impact on our P&L as fees are increasing and carriers starting to be generated. But if you look at just our stated AUM the true impact of the scaling of these businesses is understated. Some of the funds we’re raising are what we call shadow AUM where the capital is committed but we do not get paid fees until it’s actually invested. Many of our private credit mandates operate this way. We do not report shadow AUM in our AUM or fee paying AUM figures until it is invested. We do track it however as it gives us a good sense of embedded potential upside in our management fees and carry. If you look at page six you can see that our shadow AUM grew from about $6 billion at March 31st to about $10 billion, a $4 billion increase just in the second quarter. So if you want to get a real picture of our capital raising in the quarter you should look at the $3 billion we raised in AUM on page 13 of the press release and add the $4 billion of shadow AUM increase in the quarter. Combining the two we had a very active fund raising quarter. Page seven shows another element of AUM growth. In addition to the shadow AUM dynamics, we also own stakes in the hedge funds that manage approximately $12 billion in AUM, where we get a portion of their profitability. The assets of those hedge funds do not show up in our AUM, but part of their profits flow through our income statement. Page seven shows what our AUM and fee paying AUM would look like if you include shadow AUM and our pro rata share of our hedge funds partner’s AUM. As you can see, including those figures increases our AUM by 13% to $114 billion. And our fee-paying AUM by 14% to $96 billion. And all these numbers ignore our capital markets business and out $14 billion balance sheet, which don’t contribute to AUM or fee paying AUM. Speaking about balance sheet, take a look at page eight. We want to provide you with more transparency regarding what we are doing with our balance sheet. Page eight details some of the activity on the balance sheet year-to-date. Since the beginning of the year we’ve invested about $1.4 billion from the balance sheet and realized about $1.4 billion. As you can see, the largest realizations relate to Walgreens Boot alliance and monetizing some of our on-balance sheet credit portfolio, including a number of positions acquired in the KFN acquisition. On the right-hand side of the page, you can see how we are using the freed up balance sheet capital. We listed three of the larger uses of funds, including an additional $200 million investment we made in WMI Holdings, the former holding company of Washington Mutual. We made this investment opportunistically as we think WMI is a great vehicle through which to facilitate acquisitions. WMI stock is up 27% through June 30th so our investment is performing well so far. We also invested $210 million from the balance sheet as of June 30 to seed our real estate credit business. We’re seeding the portfolio and see an opportunity to create a substantial real estate credit business for the firm by dropping the balance sheet seeded portfolio into a fund or other type of vehicle to attract third-party capital. This is very similar to how we started our real estate equity business. Another first half investment from the balance sheet is Acion Partners an Asia based hedge fund that we seeded as we view Asia as an under penetrated hedge fund market. Hopefully this walkthrough gives you a sense of some of our recent activity and how we continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic weapon to start and scale newer businesses and make optimal investments we think are interesting. The bottom page of eight lists the two largest PE portfolio company investments on the balance sheet. You can see that First Data and Walgreens are now valued at $1.3 billion and $600 million respectively. So combined these two assets account for 20% of our balance sheet investments. Over time you should expect us to add additional large scale holdings selectively. So we had a good quarter. Our investment performances is strong and our businesses are scaling, perhaps even more than is apparent. So what’s next, let me mention three items I’m on page nine of the deck. First, we want to continue to take advantage of our strong investment performance for clients and the good fund raising environment to scale our newer initiatives even further. This includes the Fund II dynamic I mentioned and also finalizing fund raises for newer strategy such as direct lending and newer hedge fund products. The second is America’s Private Equity, as a reminder our last America’s PE fund raise are XI called NAXI was approximately $9 billion. NAXI is now 60% committed, has strong performance as a top quartile performing fund and the fund raising environment and LP interest and investing in the Americas feel good to us. Third, we continue to explore ways to do more in liquid alternatives. At a high level we continue to see a significant amount of investor interest in alternatives. If you look our alternatives are expected to grow over the next several years liquid alternatives specifically are expected to be a fast growing component. While we have added liquid alternative capabilities in credit and hedge fund to funds we are actively exploring strategic partnerships to allow us to bring more products globally to this fast growing space to meet the needs of our investment clients and further grow our fee paying assets. We are going to host an Investor Day in New York in fall and we’ll get back to you with details. At the Investor Day we’ll walk you through how we see the revenue growth opportunity globally for all of our businesses. Hopefully you find this new format helpful in understanding the main messages for the quarter. We feel like we are making real progress on a number of fronts and thank you for listening. Operator, please open line for questions.
Operator: Before we go into Q&A Mr. Larson would you like to add anything before we open the lines?
Craig Larson: Thanks Carmen, I was just going to say just looking at the queue we actually have quite a few people lined up in the queue so if you could please ask one question and then get back in the queue if necessary we’d appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler. Your line is open.
Craig Siegenthaler: Hey thanks. Asia Fund II had a very strong mark in the second quarter but the Asian markets have been rolling over since May. I am wondering if you can talk about the potential for negative marks in 3Q and how the recent volatility has impacted your prices in Asia Fund II.
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Craig this is Bill. I will take this one. As it relates to the performance in Asia during the second quarter you are right which is pretty strong and as you heard in my prepared remarks we had several monetizations in some of those Asia positions. Interestingly when you take a look at our public holding in our China investments and I ran these numbers on Tuesday our portfolio was only down about 4% and so when you look at where the marks were as of June 30th for those public companies and again based upon the drop in the Asia market again we have solid companies in our product we believe in China and again it was only down about 4%. I also want to point out as I ran the numbers if you take a look at where our publics were as of Tuesday, I am talking about all the public position that are embedded in that 32% that’s Scott mentioned we were up about 4% so that would be positive 4%.
Craig Siegenthaler: Got it, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore.
Glenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. I don’t know if there is anything that’s driving this specific shift in some of the structures and arrangements that you put under the shadow AUM, but I appreciate the slide and the disclosure. I am curious do they come at different fee structures things like the sovereign wealth partnership, the expansion of existing strategic partnership and does it change the way we think about the earning power of the dry powder in this expanded definition?
Bill Janetschek: Hey Glenn this is Bill Janetschek, as it relates to the economics on most of those structures take for example Special Sits and Special Sit II Special Sit I which is originally based upon committed capital, Special Sit II it was little more challenging environment to raise on the public market side committed funds and so we went to a model where we were going to get paid on invested capital. The good news is that really when you look at Special Sit I to II it’s really only a timing issue because the management fee that we are going to be able to get on Special Sit II is 1.75% on invested capital as opposed to 1.5% on the original Special Sit, but that’s just one example. As it relates to some of the more strategic partnerships, where we’re raising large amount of capital and we’ve got to be deploying that capital those are very economic trade for us, so there might be slight fee concessions that we give up, but overall it’s a very profitable business for us.
Glenn Schorr: Okay, I appreciate that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Chris Kotowski: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the slide back. I was wondering a little about out of NAXI, we saw like the first major harvest, looked like more than $800 million in realized proceeds out of NAXI and I was wondering if this is sooner than one would normally expect or do you think it is now at a point where you have a number of mature investments or was this kind of a one-off quarter for that?
Bill Janetschek: Hey Chris, this is Bill. Very specifically to NAXI what’s ended up happening in a couple of the investments that we’ve made is we’ve actually refinanced those companies and returned that capital to our investors and all you’re saying is, us putting money up closing the investment, seeing early performance go the right way, doing a little bit of refinance and getting money back to our LP sooner.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. So those were basically like dividend refinancing.
Bill Janetschek: Yes.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. And then secondly, I had, just if we look at your balance sheet, your investment and credit in terms of cost basis in the alternative credit, the last three quarters have gone from $3 billion to $2.8 billion and then $2.7 billion this quarter. So it just seems like there was kind of a deliberate rundown in that and like you’re not replacing what you’re harvesting. Can you kind of give us the thinking underlying that and whether we should see more of that?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Chris, it’s Scott. I’m happy to take that one. Yeah look, if you look at slide eight of the deck you’ll see on the left hand side we call out that we have been selling down some of our on balance sheet credit portfolios, CLO and otherwise. And frankly what we’ve seen there is an opportunity to redeploy that capital at higher returns and opportunities like those we lay out on the right hand side of the page. So it’s been somewhat deliberate because we’ve seen valuations and credit move up and so we’ve seen the returns from this point forward go down and we saw opportunities to redeploy at a higher return level. And so it’s hard to say where we’re going to go from here but it has been a deliberate move to bring down credits we’re deploying to other areas.
Chris Kotowski: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim from Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Michael Kim: Hey guys good morning. Just to maybe follow up on the discussion on shadow AUM. I know it’s difficult to generalize just given the different strategies and opportunities sort of beneath the surface if you will it. Any thoughts or color on how you’re thinking about sort of the timeline or trajectory for potentially deploying those assets?
Scott Nuttall: So Michael, it’s Scott. I guess what I would tell you one of the biggest components of the shadow AUM is our private credit business. And that business as we talked about in our last call has really scaled from $3 billion to now well in excess of $15 billion in the last few years and if you think about the deployment in those strategies if you look at our Direct Lending I or Special Sit I funds you know we’ve been managed to get that money to work in a two to three years kind of timeframe. These funds are going to be larger, would be our expectation and then obviously Direct Lending II is much larger than Direct Lending I but if you think in the two to four-year timeframe that’s probably a reasonable expectation.
Bill Janetschek: And Michael, this is Bill. Just a little bit of a follow-up on shadow AUM. We’ve been talking about shadow AUM on the earnings for probably the last couple of years and it’s always been roughly at a range of in between say $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion. We saw a significant increase this quarter and what we’ll end up doing is we’re signing commitments, we’re raising capital but it’s not just coming through or AUM or fee paying AUM because of the way we report it. But we wanted to make sure we draw it to your attention the significant capital raising that we’ve had over the last couple of quarters and I hope you find this information useful. Another thing that I want you just take a look at is, if you look at page 15 in that uncalled commitment column a lot of the shadow AUM that we’re talking about on the slide six is actually reflected on that table. So you could see Special Sits II where we’ve got uncalled capital the $1.6 billion that’s part of that shadow AUM.
Michael Kim: Got it, that’s helpful. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi.
Bill Katz: Okay, thanks for taking my questions, I appreciate the actual disclosure it is very helpful. Just a big picture question, Scott I may read too much into this but it sounds like as you monetize some of the bigger stakes in the balance sheet you said this would be tactically adding to over time so I guess the question is as you are scaling the business will it be what you have now or shadow AUM and given what looks like a bit of a slowdown in dry power deployment and much of your peer saying hey the markets are pretty heavier with the equity fix income. Can you talk about rationale of managing such a large balance sheet at this point in time, is it strategically compelling now as you scale the business and maybe the root question here so Craig just [indiscernible] is could you lower the size of the balance sheet and maybe pickup cap return in terms of repurchase on top of the distribution?
Bill Janetschek: Great, thanks for the question, Bill. I’d probably separate topics a little bit if it’s right. First let’s talk about deployment, if you look at actually the deployment that we’ve seen across the firm over the course of this year, it’s actually been pretty strong, relative to the first half of last year $4 billion in private markets, this year at $3.3 billion so far that doesn’t include some investments like WMI so if you include those it’s actually closer to $4 billion. So we’ve seen private markets deployment kind of flat to off a little bit after a very active first half last year. And if you look in public markets you can actually see deployments gone up. So for gross dollars invested $1.8 billion first half last year $2.3 billion first half of this year it’s across Direct Lending, mezzanine and special situations. So we continue to find interesting ways to deploy capital, we are being very prudent because valuations have moved up in most markets but if you look at in the markets like Asia where we’ve been active in the number of different areas we’ve been able to find some very interesting opportunities special situations Direct Lending we are finding needs for capital have been active there. I would separate that discussion from the balance sheet question. As we talked about the last several quarters, our model is a bit different than its model that we choose and we like having this marriage of third party AUM with our own balance sheet and our capital markets business because we think it allows us to really monetize our ideas to a much greater extent. And I would actually take the result at this quarter as a proof point as to what the model can generate when we see strong investment performance across all of our different businesses. So if you look at what happen you can we’ve had good investment performance that translated into good performances, carry and balance sheet results and the capital market business intermediated a lot of that was able to generate attractive risk free economics for the most part for the firm. So we kind of view the quarter as saying, here is what it looks like when the model is really working on a number of funds. And we like having our balance sheet as our own largest investor and part of the reason we want to give you this disclosure is we want you to see what we’re doing with the balance sheet. We continue to use it to seed new businesses, scale businesses that we are in and we see it as really an opportunity to help create new product to drive more opportunities for our investment clients and drive more fee paying AUM. So we view it as kind of a virtuous cycle. So our view is that we want to continue to have a large balance sheet, because we are believers in ourselves and our ability to generate investment performance and we want all of us as shareholders to participate in that upside to a greater extent. If you then go on to another implicit question that you asked, which is, dividend policy buyback. As we’ve discussed we have chosen thus far to have all of us as shareholders to participate in our performance through a large payout. So we’ve been paying out 75% to 80% of our cash flow. We’ll continue to access whether that’s the right way for all of us to participate. Obviously, the topic of buyback has come up in prior quarters. Thus far the view has been let’s pay it out in dividend as opposed to doing a buyback, but we’ll continue to access it.
Bill Katz: Okay. Thanks for taking all my embedded questions.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning folks.
Bill Janetschek: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe just to focus a little bit, maybe Scott, you were talking about the Americas Private Equity is sort of what’s next idea. If you could talk a little bit about - two-part of question I guess, the deployment outlook in the Americas given what we’ve seen in high valuations where you are finding opportunities. And then thinking about the fund raising outlook, beyond where you are already in the market for in and to potential to raise a NAXI 12, sometime in the next I don’t know 12 to 18 month or so.
Bill Janetschek: Happy to take it Bryan [ph]. Look I think a couple things. One, let’s start with deployment. As I mentioned that NAXI fund is about 60% invested and committed. They include transactions we’ve announced but haven’t yet closed and so we continue to find interesting opportunities. Valuations in the US are pretty high but we have managed to find some opportunities bit off the run that we find interesting. Two recent ones we announced Mature [ph] which is high note worth life insurance provider and CHI which is a garage door manufacturer. So these aren’t opportunities that you necessarily going to redevelop in the paper but, in most of those situations we’ll deploy $300 million or so of equity which is kind of been in our sweet spot for last several years. So we are finding some interesting opportunities for deployment and as we talked about we are taking advantage of the equity capital markets to facilitate exits as well. In terms of fund raising all I can tell you is that we’d expect to be in market soon to launch the successor to the NAXI Fund and as I mentioned we are pleased, performance have been top quartile so we were finding good ways to get capital to work, we’re pleased with the early results and we’ll be in market soon.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, thanks very much.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ann Dai from KBW.
Ann Dai: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There’s been some discussions by some of your peers about creating pools of capital that invests for 10 years longer than the average PE fund. So is your funding what your thoughts are on that and you know if it’s that something KKR would be interesting in doing?
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Ann. We’ve looked at it. I think the thesis is that there’s some investments that you may want to hold for very long period of time where the returns maybe a bit below traditional private equity fund targets. And it’s something that we’ll continue to look at. If it does become a part of the business I would expect it to be relatively a small part but you know it’s something that we’re assessing and exploring with a partner or two.
Ann Dai: Great. Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt: Good morning guys. I think Alex at a conference last quarter mentioned that NAXI’s EBITDA growth had tracking at 20% plus year-over-year which is clearly better than market and seems pretty outsized even relative to funds of similar vintage. Is there any one or two positions driving that, is there an industry confrontation that’s maybe driving that? I mean it’s pretty incredible.
Scott Nuttall: Patrick its Scott. I think what I’d like to do is probably aggregate a little bit for you and maybe talk more about that portfolio more broadly.
Patrick Davitt: Okay.
Scott Nuttall: So our overall private equity portfolio we track this quarterly, has continued to perform quite well. If you look globally last 12 months we’ve had about 8% revenue growth and about 13% EBITDA growth and that’s on the global portfolio. Within that you’d see North America and Asia growing faster than the 13 and Europe growing more slowly but we’ve been quite pleased with the private equity portfolio performance. The Americas private equity portfolio has been performing very well. I would tell you that within the NAXI portfolio it’s been petty broad based, it’s not just one or two companies or one or two industries.
Patrick Davitt: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question and thanks for the enhanced disclosure in the slide deck that’s helpful. Just around that on the balance sheet you mentioned I think it was slide eight that you amortized that $1.4 billion in the first half of balance sheet and also invested about $1.4 billion. Just curious how much of that came through in the second quarter alone and then as we think about reflecting this in our model this enhanced disclosure is this something we can expect to see similar level of disclosure going forward?
Bill Janetschek: Hey, Michael. This is Bill. I’ll take that one. As it relates to the $1.4 billion approximately half of that came through the first quarter and other half came through in the second quarter. And far as disclosure is concerned I would say that because we’ve gotten a lot of emails from a few of the analyst that cover us and they found this quite helpful from a transparency point of view and you just mentioned it as well. I would say that we’re going to continue to report this on a quarterly basis.
Michael Cyprys: Okay, thanks great. And I want just to make sure I understand so the $1.4 billion on the monetization and the investment side they were each roughly half-half first quarter second quarter?
Bill Janetschek: Yes, it’s pretty close, it’s not going to be exact but it’s very close to being in the neighborhood of 50-50 on both sides.
Michael Cyprys: Got it. And then sense just on the deployment outlook off the balance sheet $1.4 billion in the first quarter how are you thinking about things going into the second half of the year?
Bill Janetschek: Hard to be too specific as it’s going to be based on the opportunities as we see them. We continue to see opportunities in real estate credit, so I’d expect that number will continue to go up. As I mentioned, we are continuing to explore strategic partnerships and liquid alternatives. So you may see us do some more there. But it’s hard to be too precise because it’s based on the opportunities that are coming our way and how the markets evolve.
Michael Cyprys: Okay, got it. Thanks so much.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America.
Mike Carrier: Thanks guys. You said a question, I guess the revenue and just the expenses kind of on the core, the fee earnings. Just on the management fees it seemed like it ticked up. I just wanted to find out if there were anything like catch up fees this quarter? And then in the outlook, if we should be expecting anything differently? And then just on the monitoring fees, Bill I think you mentioned, you kind of gave a range because the first quarter was extremely strong. So just any update on that, and I know it’s volatile. So whatever you can us. And then on the expenses both the core comp and the non-comp expenses, both were either well managed or came in lower than expected. So just wanted to see if there were anything unusual in the expense lines in terms of the run rate going forward?
Bill Janetschek: Sure. And although you were told to ask one question, I think there were three questions.
Mike Carrier: Sorry about that.
Bill Janetschek: I’ll give you a pass. But when you talk about management fees, let’s talk about private markets. You could see that there is a slight uptick. A little bit of that is a catch up with regards the E4 fund closing and Infra II but that’s modest. When you look at public markets, you could see slight increases and that’s just assets coming online like its Direct Lending II and Special Sits II so nothing where you would see a reversal of that number in the subsequent quarter. As it relates to monitoring fees we said last quarter that the average run rate on monitoring fees should be approximately $20 million a quarter. You could see that the number in the first quarter was quite large and we talked about a monitoring termination payment from the Boots, Walgreens transaction. In the second quarter we also had two monitoring termination payments one of which was outsize and that was the Biomet, Zimmer transaction. And so you would see those happen episodically but again back to your earlier question the run rate number for modeling purposes should be about 20. As it relates to expenses you could see that the expenses in private markets were and we’re talking about operating expenses were down from $42 million. That really was driven by smaller get deal expenses in private markets. But overall you could see that the expense from the first quarter and I’m talking about total reportable segments went down from 60 to 51. I would say that this is probably a light quarter from an expense point of view and you should think that that number is going to be anywhere in between say 55 and 65 on a quarterly basis.
Mike Carrier: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Bill Janetschek: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.
Devin Ryan: Hey, good morning. Most questions have been asked here but maybe just one on the energy exposures across the platform, you didn’t really touch on that I know who the better story this quarter. But we’ve seen a slight reversal in commodities thus far and the third quarter. So I’m just trying to get a sense. If we don’t see a recovery in commodity prices from here do you see any impact on related exposures or you have to take an additional marks or do we get to maybe a point where hedges roll off and so there could be some more pain, just trying to get some sense here?
Craig Larson: It’s Craig, let me a few thoughts on that. First, and it’s a good question. One other things that is important to remember is that as the energy investments largely are valued will run long lived discounted cash flow analyses. So when you look at the movements in commodity prices both in terms of oil and natural gas, and along with that by the way is it and you referenced this, is that the majority of our near term production is hedged. So the results of that is that the shape of curve and prices four to five years out are important to consider that’s true both when prices are higher as well as lower. So when you look at the movements that you referenced in terms of crude and natural gas you have seen some low teens to mid-teens movement downwards in spot crude but when you look four to five years out that you’ve seen movement a lot less than that. And from the standpoint of our overall holdings were pretty equally split between natural gas and crude and natural gas prices have actually haven’t seen that same type of volatility, one off at this point. Now one of the things that does read into this it’s also just worth mentioning is from a deployment standpoint, one of the new launches is that if you look at the second quarter at least we actually we are not active in deploying or were not active even in terms of deploying capital in Q2, in our energy strategies. I think as we’ve seen commodity prices moved down even since June 30, we actually think that could help opportunities in the back half of the year. So we’re pretty constructive on what that opportunity is and what those opportunities could be for us. Although with the margin we’re probably seeing more opportunities at the asset level versus the corporate level. And one other point as we think about this vertical actually would relate to infrastructure because infrastructure actually is an area where we have been very active. So even within the last couple of, last two weeks we’ve announced another couple of investments within our Infra II funds those naturally haven’t closed but at this point even with those four investments Infra II is over 25% committed which is certainly a healthy figure recognizing that we only held the final close in Infra II early in the month.
Devin Ryan: Great. Very helpful color, I appreciate the update.
Operator: And then our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt: Yeah thanks for the follow-up. You mentioned the third-party stakes or the minority stakes and hedge funds, could you kind of walk through all of the hedge funds that are in that bucket and how they’re performing?
Scott Nuttall: Sure, Patrick. It’s Scott. So a couple of things, stepping back as a reminder let’s just talk about the hedge fund business broadly for a moment. So we really, we really got three or four different components. So as you know we have the KKR Prisma platform where we manage about 11 billion of solutions and fund to funds mandates, we’re creating new product off that platform, we’re direct investment product, so we’ll give you updates on that, those efforts build over time. We mentioned the seed investment that we made in Asia, the Acion Partners investment that I mentioned in the prepared remarks and on the stake side today we really have two. We’ve got in the Nephila which manages about $10 billion and then we have BlackGold which mean is approximately $2 billion so $12 billion in aggregate and we earn approximately 25% of each and so if you take the 25% of the $12 billion, that’s how you get the $2.9 billion on slide seven is part of that bridge. We have taken a different approach to stakes than other which is that we are approaching it much more as a strategic matter. So this is investments that we’re making off our balance sheet and we believe that we have an ability to work with our partners to create new product and deliver solutions to clients that otherwise we can’t deliver with just the products that we manage on a 100% own basis. Both Nephila and BlackGold financially for the firm have performed in line with or in excess of original expectations.
Patrick Davitt: And was there another negative mark in the LP investment you have in BlackGold the $100 million.
Bill Janetschek: No, Patrick, this is Bill. It was flat for the second quarter.
Patrick Davitt: Okay, thanks a lot.
Bill Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: And I would like to turn the call back to Larson for any final remarks.
Craig Larson: Just thank you everybody for your time. Thank you, Carmen. If there are any follow-up questions please feel free to follow up with me directly.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day everyone.

Operator: Welcome to KKR’s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I’ll now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Candice. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I’m joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we’ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. The call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results and more importantly, these results reflect a lot of the themes we’ve been talking about over the last few quarters. So because of this, we’ll be able to quickly review the numbers and then move into Q&A. Turning to our results. We reported first quarter economic net income of $599 million which equates to $0.62 of after tax economic net income per unit. We continue to be active on the realization front. So, let me spend a few minutes on our cash metrics. Total distributable earnings were $517 million in first quarter, which translates into $0.60 of distributable earnings per unit net of taxes. Both of these figures are up over 35% from last quarter, driven by an increase in net realized carry. And in terms of the flow-through to the distribution, we’ve announced a first quarter distribution per unit of $0.46, which is up over 30% from the fourth quarter of 2014. And with that, I’ll now turn it over to Bill, to discuss our financial performance in more depth.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks Craig. Let me begin with our segments. In private markets, we reported first quarter ENI of $568 million, up meaningfully from the fourth quarter. There are three main drives of this increase: First, our private equity portfolio appreciated 5.1% in the first quarter, outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 400 basis points. Our public performed particularly well, increasing over 10% in Q1. Second, our private market balance sheet assets were up in Q1, increasing investment income quarter-over-quarter. And finally, transaction and monitoring fees increased from Q4 as we’ve received termination payments in Q1 from Big Heart and Alliance Boots which contributed about $45 million of net monitoring fees. And keep in mind, we share these monitoring fees 80-20 and favor our LPs in our traditional private equity fund. Touching on public markets, we reported $3 million of ENI this quarter. It is worth spending a minute on our investment income. First, on the CLOs. Interest income from our CLO portfolio was approximately $40 million in the quarter, generating an annualized cash yield of about 11%. Total investment income from the CLO this quarter though was only modestly net positive as the interest income was largely offset by unrealized losses. A big contributor of the unrealized losses in our CLO portfolio relates to our decision to call [ph] two of the CLOs. Given repayments within these specific CLOs, our ROEs were trending towards mid single digits, so we call them. And we look to redeploy this capital at higher ROEs. In addition, we wrote down a couple of other investments in public markets, all of which contributed to the unrealized loss this quarter. Moving to capital markets, we reported first quarter ENI of $28 million, up from $21 million we reported in Q4, driven by higher transaction fees. Here our diversification continues to drive growth in this segment. In the first quarter, 70% of KCM’s revenue came from outside of the U.S. and 30% came from our third-party business. I’d like to spend a minute on the balance sheet. We reported our March 31st book value of $12.19 per unit, which is up 9% on a year-over-year basis. This 9% increase or about $1 per unit is after paying out $1.90 per unit in distribution, over the last 12 months. This is important to understand because combining book value growth with the LTM dividend pay, we’ve created about $3 per unit of value for shareholders year-over-year, on a starting base of $11.18 or 25% return. We’ve returned two thirds of that through our distribution with the other third through the compounding of our book value. We also grew the carry payable on our balance sheet. Our March 31st book value includes an 8% increase in unrealized carry year-over-year, bringing that figure to $1.4 billion with almost a $100 million of that coming from our public markets segment and that’s after paying out over $800 million of net realized cash carry over the last year. As Craig mentioned earlier, our distribution in the first quarter is $0.46 per unit which includes $0.15 of fee and yield earnings, $0.22 of realized carry from eight realizations with the remainder coming from realized balance sheet gains. Finally, in terms of our AUM and fee paying AUM as of March 31st, our assets under management were $99 billion and fee paying assets under management were $83 billion. Keep in mind, these figures do not reflect approximately $6 billion of committed capital that will be included in AUM once it’s invested. And since March 31st, we raised an additional $1.4 billion in follow-on closings with Special Sit II, Direct Lending II and Infra II. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. I’m going to have three topics today: Performance; monetization; and the development of some of our newer businesses. Let’s start with performance. If you look across the firm, we had a good first quarter with strong investment performance across the majority of our asset classes. In private equity, our portfolio appreciated 5.1%. The larger positions in the PE portfolio continue to perform. This is the second consecutive quarter that we’ve written up First Data and saw an increase in the value of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Together, these two investments appreciated 9% in the first quarter, contributing meaningfully to our accrued carry and balance sheet income. At the same time, many of our recent vintage funds are performing specially well. To give you a sense, NAXI, Asia II and real estate funds had gross IRRs that range between 25% and 45% since inception. And we’ve only been investing capital here for three years. Before I leave private markets, I want to touch on energy and infrastructure. Given the continued decline in the underlying commodity prices in the quarter, the energy portfolio was marked down modestly. The balance sheet energy assets were down 4% in the quarter and across our energy funds, our investments were down 5%. Our infrastructure strategies continued to perform with the infrastructure funds up 5% in aggregate in the quarter. And in public markets, KKR Prisma’s low volatility composite had a gross return of 3.3% in the first quarter. And the gross IRR’s on our first special situations, mezzanine and direct lending funds since inception are 19%, 16% and 12% respectively, all significantly ahead of bench marks. Now to the second topic of monetization. We’ve been active on the private equity exit front in the first quarter, returning over $3 billion of cash to our fund investors through the public markets and strategic sales. We took GoDaddy public at the end of the first quarter and that investment at $26 per share is marked at about three times our cost. We also did secondaries at KION and Nielsen at a blended multiple of three times. And we’re also creating strategic exists. In the first quarter, we sold Fotolia to Adobe and we closed on the Big Heart transaction and the second step of the Alliance Boots transaction. In several of these cases, we’ve taken the strategic stock as a component of the deal consideration and we’ve seen those stocks trade up. For example, since the original Alliance Boots Walgreens transaction was announced in June 2012, Walgreen stock has almost tripled. The last thing I want to touch on is the development of some of our newer businesses. A key part of our strategy has been scaling the businesses that we started over the last few years. We’re nearing the end of the investment period for several of our first time funds and we are in the process of raising second generation funds as these strategies shift toward harvesting mode. In credit, we’ve been busy, raising the successor funds to our lending partners and Special Sit Funds. In April, we had a final close on Lending Partners II, totaling $1.3 billion, approximately three times the size of Fund I. And it is early days for Special Sit’s II Fund raising, but we’ve already raised $1.7 billion through its first closing. We also held another close on Infra II, bringing the total capital rate to-date to $2.5 billion, already hitting the low end of our fund raising goal of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We’ve also recently announced that we extended our relationship with Texas Teachers to including an additional $2 billon of committed capital which will be invested in our private markets and alternative credit strategies. This $2 billion is subject to documentation and is not included in the $6 billion of shadow AUM that Bill mentioned earlier. Stepping back, three years ago, the combined assets that we managed in alternative credit, energy and infrastructure, and real estate were $7 billion. Today, including closes since March 31 and shadow AUM, we managed $24 billion in these strategies. Alternative credit, including CCT has gone from $3.5 billion to $15 billion; energy and infra went from about $3 billion to $8 billion; real estate went from investing balance sheet capital to $1.4 billion all in the last three years. This growth has been entirely organic and the balance sheet has been a real accelerator of our efforts in all of these areas. Growing from $7 billion to $24 million in each strategies plus Prisma which has grown from $8.5 billion to $10.7 billion since the acquisition is early proof concept for what we’ve been trying to achieve. The good news is investment performance has been strong, the end markets are large and we see an opportunity to really scale from here. Our investment performance and business development progress are evident in our results. Over the last 12 months, our total distributable earnings are up 30%; our distribution is up 25% with the more recurring part of our distribution up 35%; and we’ve generated a cash ROE of 20%. We’re pleased with our start to the year but there is a lot more to come in 2015. Thanks for joining our call. Operator, can we please open the line for any questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Chris Kotowski: Good morning. I wonder if you could expand a bit on the CLOs and the marks, and explain what exactly happens when you call a CLO and how that affects the cash flows and portfolio marks. And just I guess in the broader context, it looked to us like leverage loan prices were generally kind of flattish in the quarter but you took a couple of percent mark down. So, how did that all interact?
Bill Janetschek: This is Bill. At a very high level, the CLO portfolio, if you have a CLO that you expect to secure over a four or five year period, to the extent that sits in the post investment period and you actually have prepayments because those prepayments were coming in quicker than expected, with the leverage on the CLO, the return that you’re getting because of those prepayments aren’t what you’d model out. And so because of the acceleration of prepayments, you actually see that CLO value come in a little. And so, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, the CLO generated a good amount of income vis-à-vis interest income, so we had a mark-to-market on the overall CLO portfolio. So, on a net basis, CLOs were up and again on a net basis, modestly.
Scott Nuttall: Chris, just maybe to add to that, the way it works is we get a third party mark on our CLO equity every quarter and we have a CLO that’s in its active investing period, that mark maybe higher than the net asset value of the underlying equity by a little bit because if you get credit for the ability to reinvest, proceeds in the CLO and keep CLO continuing to grow and generate cash. When you put a CLO into graph [ph] or you call it, you may see a little bit of reversion to NAV. And so really what happened in this quarter in those couple of CLOs that we call we had a little bit reversion to NAV, away from that if you look at your comment about leverage loan price being pretty flat, the CLOs performed as expected. So, the way I would think about it is with those two CLOs in particular, markdown that we would not expect to repeat, free up cash and deploy that cash into new CLOs which we’ve been printing quite actively at much higher returns.
Bill Janetschek: When you think about it, we don’t think that we’re going to be growing any other CLOs over the next quarter.
Chris Kotowski: And then I noticed that on your balance sheet, you deployed another nearly $200 million of balance sheet capital in the real estate segment which was more than actually you drew down in the American real estate fund. So, is that just some properties or are you seeding a new fund or what’s happening there?
Bill Janetschek: Chris, that’s very good question. We mentioned this on the call I think prior to this one and that we brought over a real estate credit team. So, whole idea is with our balance sheet, we had them investing in real estate credit. And so you will see those earnings come through the balance sheet for the time being. The goal is by bringing them over here, having them invest off the balance sheet, proof concept we’ll then be able to go out and raise third-party capital. So, the biggest increase in that number on real estate came from those folks deploying that real estate credit during this quarter.
Craig Larson: I was just going to say -- and thanks Chris, we have well over dozen folks actually in the queue. So, if people could limit themselves to one question and then if it isn’t asked, please feel naturally to get back in the queue would be helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Bill Katz: Maybe I’ll cheat and ask a two-part question if I could. So, I think there has been some changes at BlackGold, one of the investments you’ve made in the alternative space around that performance metric. So, I’m wondering how did that filter into the marks in the quarter. And then the broader question Scott perhaps is, does this change your vetting process as you think about continuing to invest in some of these other smaller entities you’re trying to scale? Thanks.
Craig Larson: Hey, Bill, it’s Craig; why don’t I take the first one of that. We acquired a 25% stake in the general partner of BlackGold in July of last year 2014. And the purchase -- well the purchase price isn’t public, we’re not talking about material investments for us. So to-date, assets are up from when we made the investments. In addition to that we voluntarily invested a $100 million of balance sheet capital as in LP in Q4. And there is a negative mark on that investment this quarter that impacts the unrealized investment income line within public markets in Q1. So the net impact of this, to answer your question is about $15 million in terms of our ENI in this segment in the quarter.
Bill Katz: You said 15 or 50?
Craig Larson: 15.
Bill Katz: Thank you. Sorry. Go ahead, Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Sure. And the broader question about the vetting [ph] process and the short answer is no. I think we have made two of the stakes investments and we’ve done one seed, all this has been done off the balance sheet. And if you look at that portfolio as a whole, it’s performed very well in terms of the cash on cash returns that we’re generating for the balance sheet. I would say that the BlackGold situation at year end was unfortunate but really the results of the fact of it are very fast changing commodity prices right at your end. And so we don’t think that that’s something that is recurring in nature but obviously we’ve got these investments closing. We work closely with the management on a go forward basis but we’re still committed to the strategy.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question come from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Mike Carrier: Scott, you gave some color on some of the newer strategies, what you’ve grown over the past couple of years getting to $24 billion. I guess when you look at the outlook and what you guys are working on strategically, where do you see that growth opportunity coming from? And I guess given that we’re still in this realization cycle, do you think over the next couple of years you guys are still on the pace of growing your fee AUM over that time? And just related to that, just because like transaction and monitoring fees were high, just any color on that as you’re growing the business?
Scott Nuttall: I think in terms of the outlook, I’ll take that and maybe Bill you can comment on transaction and monitoring fees. But if you look at where we’re growing, I think the short answer to your question of do we expect to be able to grow our assets is, yes. And it really kind of runs across all our different asset classes. Private equity as you know, we’ve had an active business there for nearly 40 years and we continue to see opportunities to grow around the world. We’re in the market now with our European IV Fund which is closed on $2.4 billion so far and a wrap up this year of the Americas private equity funds will be launching later this year fund raising. We close Asia II not long ago. That franchise went from $4 billion in Asia I to $6 billion in Asia II plus our China growth opportunities. So we see opportunities globally in private equity to continue to scale. Our credit business, if you include the AUM that’s committed to us that is when we didn’t get the fees once we invest the capital is now better part of $30 billion, has been growing very quickly; as I said the private credit component, special situations, direct lending, mezzanines gone from $3.5 billion to $15 billion so far. And we see significant opportunities to continue to scale in private credit and in the leverage credit and opportunistic credit aspects of what we do. We’re printing CLOs, so we see opportunities in credit. Our infrastructure business, as I mentioned has gone from $1 billion in Fund I to now $2.5 billion so far, raised for Fund II and so see a lot of opportunity to continue to scale there, the significant capital needs around the world. Real estate, the young business for us where we see an extra ordinary opportunity to invest capital globally and still see some supply demand imbalances that are quite acute especially in the opportunistic value-add end of the spectrum. And as Bill mentioned, we’re seeing opportunities in real estate credit as well but we’re just getting started. Hedge funds, massive space, the biggest part of our alternative assets is actually the hedge funds space. And between KKR Prism, a new product that we’re launching there this year plus our direct hedge funds and the stakes and seeds I mentioned, we see a significant opportunity for growth there as well. So, there is opportunities really across the firm and around the world. We’ve now got 22 offices. At KKR, we’ve got the majority of our investment professionals outside the United States, across all these asset classes. So, what I would tell you is that we do see significant opportunity. The opportunities go from fund I to fund II is more economically powerful than just we raise more money. Because if you think about what happens when fund I gets raised, you’ve got all the expense for the revenue. And then when we raise fund II, we still get to pay management fees from fund I, and fund II tends to come on at so far anyway two to three times the size of fund I and carry starts to be generated from fund I at the same time, management fees come on for fund II. So we see a lot opportunities for growth in economics which is I think the more important think to look at in just the AUM. And then the other bigger point I’d make is the end markets for all of these areas combined is significant. If we add up all the end markets that we’re talking about, it’s about $6 trillion relative to about $1 trillion for traditional private equity. So, we see a big opportunity.
Bill Janetschek: Just quickly on transaction and monitoring fees. When you think about it on the private market side, we receive transaction fees from real estate; infrastructure; and PE. We’ve got about $19 billion of dry powder to deploy over the next few years. We continue to raise capital for example, in PE for E4. And so, depending on pace of deployment, that’s obviously going to drive those transaction fees. As it relates the monitoring fees, there is a little static in the monitoring fees over the last couple of quarters. But when you think about modeling on a run rate basis, taking into account a fewer determination payments has actually occurred, both in the first quarter of ‘14 and the first quarter of ‘15 and the fourth quarter of ‘14; the run rate should be roughly about $20 million.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is now open. Please check your mute button.
Patrick Davitt: On the KFN yield, it looks like maybe there is some noise in there from the CLO call. I don’t know -- or I guess there shouldn’t -- but looks like it came down to $0.05 from $0.07. Is that a result of any credit issues or could you kind of give us some color on what happened there?
Bill Janetschek: No Patrick, it really wasn’t related to credit issue. The CLO cash earnings out of KFN in the fourth quarter and d first quarter were roughly about the same. Some of the yields from KFN is in some energy assets and they were a little light this quarter. And so as you know, last quarter the KFN number was higher than this quarter but still we’re pretty pleased with the $40 million. We could hope to expect a little bit of upsize but based upon when we did the acquisition, we were modeling in somewhere around that number.
Patrick Davitt: The $0.05 number?
Bill Janetschek: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Chris Harris: Bigger picture question on investing activity. Correct me if you guys disagree with this statement but it seems like a lot of the investing you guys are doing, in some regards, is strategic in nature, whereas if you normally think about the business cycle, you think this environment might lend itself to material large private equity buyouts. Is there something about the environment, maybe that’s not really amenable to those transactions or do you guys think that hey, you’ve got so much going on, so much growth in all these other areas, that’s not really a primary focus right now?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks for the question Chris. It’s Scott, I’ll take it. I think the short answer is valuations are high. And if you look at the markets historically where there have been larger buyouts done, U.S. and Europe in particular, valuations are quite high. And so, we do remain very focused on our private equity businesses of course. But as we look at deployment, we’re frankly being judicious given what we see is a pretty elevated valuation market. We talked about monetization, so we’ve been selling into the strength. But in the U.S. if you look at where we’ve been investing, it’s been pockets of opportunities and really more in the undertaking advantage of what’s been a good environment which to liquidate our portfolio. So, we’re taking companies public; we’ve done secondaries; we sold a lot of companies to strategic and that’s been turn in the U.S. and Europe outside of some selective opportunities where we have a real angle. So, it’s not really as much of a strategic shift for us as it is just a focus on being careful in a very lofty valuation environment. And the one place I would say there is an exception to that however has been in Asia. And Asia is not a large buyout market of course, but if you look at actually where we’ve been the most active from the deployment standpoint over the course of last year, it’s been in Asia. And if you think about we’ve done this year, GE consumer finance, the Ticket Monster deal we just announced, we are seeing some interesting deployment opportunities as a result of the fall out of the slowdown in China. So, I think you’ll continue to see us active there and then selectively active in the U.S. and Europe.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Luke Montgomery: You’ve got $15 billion of fair value in fund 2006. A typical PE fund has a 10 year life, so I think you could argue this one is getting a little bit long in the tooth. I was hoping maybe you could speak to the maturity of the most significant positions in the fund, where you are in the process of making operational improvements that would lead to an exit at some point? And then how likely it is you’ll ask the LPs to extend the life of the fund? I know the actual exits are hard to predict but obviously these dynamics are going to have big effect on how your distributions are phased over the next few years.
Scott Nuttall: I think you’re talking about 2006 fund.
Luke Montgomery: Correct.
Scott Nuttall: So, one thing to keep in mind, that fund is now marked at about 1.8 times our costs. And so one of the I think one of the things that’s happening is as we’ve created value and we’ve been selling a lot out of that fund, the remaining fair value continues to be quite high. So, if you can see, we invested, on the funds table on page 13, up $17 billion and we’ve realized $15 billion of about $30 billion of fair value so far, so over half of the fair value has already been returned in cash. And so that’s one thing to keep in mind as you look at that because we’ve already given a lot of cash back. And I think our investors are pleased with the amount of cash we’ve sent back to them. If you look at the portfolio itself, we actually don’t need to get an extension. Plenty of times we continue to monetize that portfolio. But one of the things we look at from a maturity of the portfolio standpoint is how those investments are marked. And if you look at one of the things that we’re quite pleased with is if you look at the portfolio as a whole, we have more than half of our portfolio marked at 1.5 times our cost or greater and something like 30% or 40% is marked at two times or more, so it’s actually 37%, two times our cost or more in our private equity portfolio. So, the good news is as that portfolio matures, we continue to create value and we find ourselves in a good exit environment. And so I think that short answer is, you continue to see us monetize investments out of that portfolio. And we don’t think it’s going to create any issues from the standpoint of timing of the type that you referenced.
Bill Janetschek: And Luke, just to follow-up, not specific really to the 06 fund but the private equity fund in general. When you take a look at where we are today, roughly about a third of the value is in public securities right now. So, to the extent that we would think to monetize some of those assets, a third has the ability to the sold and exit it through secondary offerings.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim of Sandler O’ Neil. Your line is now open.
Michael Kim: So, not sure if you really look at things this way, but you’ve mentioned over the last 12 months you’ve generated I think about $800 million of realized cash carry. And based on our math, that equates to a little over 60% of the unrealized carry receivable a year ago. So understand that realized carry can be lumpy and it’s hard to get a sense of the outlook going forward. But just given the unrealized carry balance continues to grow and the exit environment as you mentioned still seems pretty constructive, how should we be thinking about sort of that conversion ratio, if you will, as we sort of try and frame the outlook for cash carry going forward?
Bill Janetschek: Michael, it’s hard to come up with a conversion ratio, but when you think about where we’ve been over the last couple of years, with all of the monetizations that we’ve had, remember in private equity, we distributed about $11 billion to our LPs and the year prior it was I think anywhere in between $9 million and $10 million. So, you’ see a lot of velocity going through with regard to returning cash. But more importantly, we have continued to deploy that capital, new capital in those funds, marking those investments up and actually appreciating the unrealized carry on our balance sheet while making these significant distributions. That was my point earlier, when you look at where we are on a book value per se, we’ve actually distributed out about two thirds of the appreciation off our book. And when you take into account the dollar of accretion on our balance sheet over the past year, I mean that’s to 25% return.
Craig Larson: Yes, I think there is a couple things to focus on. One is you’re right that we have been able to keep actually the accrued carry amount growing despite all of the monetization’s. It’s not going to be possible for us to give you a conversion ratio that we can tell you to be comfortable with. But the reason that we share these metrics in terms of how much of our portfolios in public stock should give you a sense. Also, we do find it interesting just how much strategic activity has picked up in terms of exits and those exits are much quicker. So, it’s hard to give you a conversion ratio, but it is something that we’ll continue to share with you that help you think your way through it. The other thing to keep in mind is we have this on page 10 of the press release is we’re starting to also create accrued carry from some of these newer businesses. So, as you look at the public markets, business is now starting to accrue some carry; the same thing will be happening in infrastructure and real estate. And so hopefully we’ll have a broader base of accrued carry across all of the new businesses as we move from fund I to fund II which will continue to have that amount grow.
Michael Kim: Got it. That’s helpful and just related to that, any early look into the second quarter distribution. I think you typically give some guidance on that?
Bill Janetschek: Generally speaking Michael, we do but when you look at where we are today, the one item that would impact the second quarter is the possibility of the Biomet transaction closing. Right now we have it earmarked but hopefully closing in June, but that might not happen until July or early August. If it were to happen in the second quarter, based upon the value today that would equate to roughly about $0.06 of carry as well as balance sheet earnings. And then based upon a few of the secondaries that have taken place since March 31st, that’s roughly another $0.03. So that would be at $0.09. And then when you think about the yield component of our distribution being anywhere between 15 to 18, right now if Biomet closed would be $0.25 and we aren’t even through the end April.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Glenn Schorr: Thanks, a quickie here. Debt and preferred was up like 22% in the quarter. I’m just curious what the intended proceeds, is that to further invest on balance sheet?
Bill Janetschek: Well, as you know, Glenn, we actually had a $500 million raise of 30-year paper, which we locked in just a tic above 5% and another thing you’ll see is you’ll see roughly increase of $95 million on debt. That was at KCM and that was a call down on a facility to do a debt offering which was subsequently paid. And so that’s no longer on the balance sheet. But with regard to the $500 million, you could take a look at the balance sheet. Over the past few quarters, we’ve been running anywhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. And we continue to deploy that capital in a pretty prudent way. So, I would say that based upon where we are, we’re pretty comfortable with our debt level. And as you may know, we deal with the rating agencies quite often and we’re rated by S&P and Fitch and we have an A rating.
Glenn Schorr: One other tiny one is, it’s early but good month for energy prices in April so far. Just a mechanical question, is there any reason why we shouldn’t think the marks were to the positive side to the same degree they were to the negative side last quarter or I should say fourth quarter, on a proportion at basis obviously?
Scott Nuttall: Well, it’s hard to predict what’s going to happen with the energy prices from here and what the flow through will be but as a general matter, obviously when commodity prices went down, our valuations went down a bit with them. And you’d expect a reverse to be true. I’d keep an eye on where in the curve. You’ve just got the commodity prices shifting though that’s one thing to keep an eye on.
Glenn Schorr: Which part of the curve are you more sensitive to, just so I watch the right part?
Craig Larson: It’s if you are -- when you’re running a discounted cash flow based analysis, you’ll end up being more -- that valuation will be more sensitive on those prices long-term out, three, five years et cetera versus your short-term movements.
Scott Nuttall: We tend to be hedged in the shorter term period and less hedged in the longer term. So look at the long end of the curve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Craig Siegenthaler: Just a quick one here. What drove the unrealized mark in public markets outside of the CLOs. And I’m guessing it’s probably direct lending. And maybe you can also give us a little bit of color around this too.
Scott Nuttall: So, outside of the CLOs, there is really a couple items to point to. One is what Craig mentioned earlier, which is the elective investment that we made in BlackGold, so that was the $15 million that he mentioned earlier. There was some FX noise especially around European direct lending portfolio that also contributed to the mark this quarter. And then outside of that there were a couple other investments in the credit book that went down a little bit. But we’re talking on a base of about $3 billion. So, it’s pretty small movements, but if you add those three up, a collection of the small mark, one of those energy credit related, BlackGold and then FX, you get most of the difference.
Craig Siegenthaler: Got it. And just one follow-up here. If you look at North America fund 11, you deployed about half the capital raise and you’re also about half way through the investing period, but valuations obviously North America continue to kind of creep up. So, can you just give us your view on the ability to deploy this capital over the next few years especially if valuations don’t correct from here?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. I think if you look at -- you are right in terms of the observation and in terms of how much we’ve deployed and clearly, prices are a bit elevated, but having said that, we are finding some interesting opportunities in places to put money to work. If you look at what we did in the first quarter as an example, just in our Americas private equity business, we put over $600 million to work in the quarter. The biggest piece of that was a pharmaceuticals deal, so an industry that’s less cyclical where we find some opportunities from a value standpoint. Also, we made an investment in this company called Air Medical. So, we’ve found some off the run opportunities where we think the valuations are attractive where we see real operating improvement opportunities. And so if you look just those two examples, the pharmaceutical deal in Q1, Air Medical is nearly a $600 million in investment in its own. So, you don’t need to find a lot of investments for the dollars to be pretty large. And as I mentioned, given how much we have invested in the pace of deployment that we’re seeing, we have to be selective. But the pace of deployment that we expect and are seeing that we would expect to be back into the market with the next North American private equity fund later this year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Please check your mute button. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Cyprys: Just curious if you could share your latest thoughts on the direct lending opportunity, in particular online lending with the Avant transaction that you’ve done this quarter and quarter before, can we expect you to do more on that front; how big of an opportunity would online lending be for KKR?
Scott Nuttall: So, in terms of direct lending as an overall matter, as I mentioned, we’ve seen it as a real growth area. So, we started the effort in the U.S. and have really been pleased with the performance of our first direct lending fund. We also make loans out of other vehicles that we manage including our BDC. So, we’ve seen quite a bit of activity. And here what we’re doing is really doing senior secured loans to largely middle market companies. So, I think EBITDA between $25 million and $100 million, we’ve seen a real opportunity and a void in the market. Banks have pulled back from that market. We’ve been able to step into that void and generate some very attractive returns for the risk we’re taking. We’re now seeing that same trend in Europe. And so we’ve seen deployment opportunities become much more attractive in direct lending in Europe and that’s why we started our European direct lending business. And we’re in the process of raising our first European direct lending fund and have had a small first close on that fund and are seeding some of those investments off the balance sheet which will drop down into the fund. So, overall we see direct lending as a growth business for KKR. In terms of the online lending component of your question, as you noted, we did do the transaction with Avant to give them capital to continue to grow their business. We view that as an investment out of one of our credit portfolios and see that as an opportunity for us to deploy capital at attractive returns and it’s really the same thing, being able to make sure that we step into the void and provide capital to markets they don’t have access to it and get paid a little bit of excess return as a result of doing that. Hard to predict how big an opportunity that will be for us. That transaction is the first we’ve done in that space. So, we’ll keep you posted on it. I think the bigger opportunity for us is going to be in corporate direct lending than online but time will tell.
Michael Cyprys: Any sense on how competitive it is right now just in terms of the marketplace?
Scott Nuttall: Look, I think what we’re finding is there have been direct lending vehicles and online lending vehicles that have been created, so there is supply that has been created around the opportunity but the demand is quite high. So, if you think about the quantum of capital that has -- the way from the middle market, it is quite large amount of capital. So, the supply demand imbalance has been very large, especially now in Europe. And so what we’ve seen is some direct lending type vehicles get created. However, relative to the amount of capital that moved away, it’s a very small amount. So, we’re continuing to find very interesting opportunities and the supply demand imbalance is by no means being dissipated ,we’re actually seeing quite a bit that we are able to do. We’ll see -- we’ve seen relative to the middle of the crisis; we’ve seen excess spread come down a little bit, but we’re still getting paid an extra 300 to 400 basis points or more for taking the risk relative to the public markets.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Devin Ryan: You guys highlighted in your prepared remarks that you’ve been taking a portion of stock and some of the more recent deals and those are obviously being good trades for you guys. So, just trying to dig into that a little bit more. Has that been a function of just really the best structure from the best buyer or is it a positive view on the acquirer if the market rewards them for a good deal or is there any other strategic or economic considerations we should be thinking about as this maybe becoming more of the theme moving forward other than something situational?
Scott Nuttall: I’m not sure there is a broader theme in it. I think it’s much more situational. In a lot of these instances you’re right, the market has been rewarding companies that have done M&A transactions. So that obviously is on our mind. But also in some situations what will happen is we’ll get approached by a strategic acquirer. We may feel that there is quite a bit less to do in terms of opportunities to create value from there. And so one way you can get a transaction done is to say okay if we take some stock, we are not selling out per structure at this price, we’re actually going to continue to participate in that upside and that value creation and so we’ll get the value creation of our asset, plus the synergies, plus the potential for the acquirer to have multiple some multiple expansion. And so we’ll look at situation on a case by case basis but those are some of the thoughts that we go through.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Patrick Davitt: Thanks for the follow-up. You have pretty sizable Chinese equity positions now that have been on fire this year, I think 30% plus on a weighted average basis and we’re starting to hear a little bit more chatter about bubbles in those markets. Is there anything contractually keeping you from trimming those positions and how do you think about those exposures now that they’ve done so well?
Bill Janetschek: You are right, we are pretty happy with so many early performances that we’ve seen in some of these companies but when we got into these companies, we made a minority investment. The understanding between that company and us is that we would help them operationally, help them to diversify, help them be more strategic especially internationally. So, we still think even though the market has been robust, to your point, we still see a lot of upside. And so I would think you’re not going to see any monetization from any of these Chinese investments in very short term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Chris Kotowski: Hi. Just thinking about the development over the course of the year, it just seems like a lot of your big public positions Big Heart to Smucker, Go Daddy, Boots to Walgreens and Biomet and U.S. Foods that they are all just recently went public or you got the position in or it’s about to happen. And given that there are 180 day lock ups generally, should we be thinking that second and third quarter that you’re fairly constrained in what you can monetize and that it opens up later in the year?
Bill Janetschek: It depends company by company, a 180 day lock up on some of these would be quite long; I don’t know particularly quite honestly about Go Daddy but I’d venture to say probably in that not long. That said, to take away from some of the “more recent new public securities that we have that’s just a component of that 33%, 34% that I mentioned earlier.” So even if we are lock up over say the next quarter on some of those positions, we still have the ability to monetize others, if we decided to go to the secondary route.
Scott Nuttall: And I think the math is interesting, Chris. We have about $38 billion of unrealized value in our private equity portfolio. So, it’s a big portfolio, not just private and there is all the other asset classes. Of that $38 billion, about $14 billion is either public or announced sales. So, I wouldn’t get too focused on individual names because if you focus on just the ones as you mentioned, it’s a pretty small amount to that $14 billion on a percentage basis. So, we have lots of different ways to create monetization across the portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Bill Katz: So curious, your latest thoughts on tapping to the U.S. retail or maybe in the global retail opportunity, more specifically within U.S. retail, is it firm thought about making the strategic stake in any of the publicly traded asset managers to potentially accelerate the opportunity?
Scott Nuttall: Look, I think in terms of giving you an update on where we are, as you know, we’ve been investing more of our efforts around the individual investor. So, just as an example in the first quarter, about 17% of the money we raised, came from individuals; over the last couple of years, it’s been just shy of 20%. And as you know prior three, four years ago that number was virtually zero. So, we’ve been investing both from a product standpoint and people inside the firm that we’ve hired to focus on the high net worth market platforms. And in the product development space, we’ve been spending a lot of time trying to think about and working on some products that could be attractive to the individual investor. So what we’ve really thus far is focused on high net worth and ultra high net worth. The broader retail market, we’ve introduced a couple of products, one of which we’ll be rolling out pretty soon. We’ll see how that develops but it’s relatively early days. The short answer to your question about, are we thinking about taking a stake in a public asset management to accelerate that effort is, no. What we have done is created some distribution partnerships with platforms that have access. We’ve got our BDC where we have a partnership where we’ve been using them as a distribution partner and we’re the sub advisor that does the investing. And so you’ll continue to see us do things like that. But we’re pleased with the progress we’re making. And one of the things we’re keeping an eye on is the profitability net to shareholders from these efforts because the distribution channel can be an expensive element in terms of how much of the fee and carry you may want to take. So, we’ll keep developing it, probably more organically and with partnership than with any bigger strategic move for the time being.
Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Craig Larson for any further remarks.
Craig Larson: Thanks Candice and thanks everybody for your attention this quarter. Please follow-up with us naturally after the call if you have any follow-ups.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

Operator: Welcome to KKR's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Andrew. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. This call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Economic net income per unit was $0.05 in the fourth quarter and $1.84 for the full year. Turning to our cash metrics, we reported fee and yield earnings of $208 million for the fourth quarter and $733 million for the full year, which is up 69% year-over-year. Total distributable earnings were $376 million in Q4 and $2 billion for the year, which translates into $0.44 of distributable earnings per unit net of taxes for the quarter and $2.47 per unit for all of 2014, which is 25% above the full year figure for 2013. And in terms of the distribution, we have announced our fourth quarter distribution per unit of $0.35, which brings our full year distribution to $1.90 per unit, which is up 36% from the $1.40 per unit we distributed in 2013. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Bill, to discuss our performance in more depth. And then Scott is going to walk you through how we think about this performance in the context of our 2014 results.
William Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Before I walk through our segments, let me take you back to the KFN acquisition, as I think it helps frame our performance this quarter. One of the key reasons we acquired KFN was to generate more recurring cash income from our balance sheet, and we continue to see this through our financials. As Craig highlighted, our fee and yield earnings continue to grow nicely. And focusing on our distribution, fee and yield earnings contributed $0.18 towards our fourth quarter distribution. At the same time, we increased the size of our balance sheet and today have $11 billion of cash and investments. And as we mark-to-market our balance sheet investments, changes in these mark have a dollar-for-dollar impact on our investment income and our ENI. So in quarters where there is volatility, there is a potential to see swings in our ENI, and that is what you saw this quarter, and we're going to walk you through it. As we walk through ENI, it is important to remember, that mark-to-market moves do not impact the cash flow of our business and cash flow remains our focus. Let me begin with our segments. In private market, our private equity portfolio appreciated 2.7% in the fourth quarter, outperforming the MSCI World by 160 basis points and resulted in gross carry of $233 million. That said, overall investment income within private market came in a loss of $92 million, driven by the lower marks on our balance sheet energy investments, which resulted in a net unrealized loss of a little over $200 million. Scott is going to touch on our energy investments in a few minutes. As a result, we reported fourth quarter ENI in this segment of $77 million, bringing the full year ENI figure to $1.3 billion. Touching on public markets. ENI in this segment was negative $11 million in the fourth quarter, down from $48 million last quarter. Similar to Q3, unrealized losses within public market were driven by the mark-to-market write-down on our CLO portfolio on our balance sheet in the quarter. And this unrealized loss offset net interest and dividends, which were up about 17% in the fourth quarter. Moving to capital markets, we reported fourth quarter ENI of $21 million. We had higher transaction fees in the third quarter, largely from the First Data equity syndication, which caused the ENI decline in this segment. However, for the full year 2014, KCM revenues were up about 50% to $218 million. We continue to benefit from diversification in this segment, as about 40% of these revenues are from outside the United States and 30% are from our third-party business. We reported at December 31 book value of $12.07 per unit, which is up 11% on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, the 11% increase or $1.24 per unit is after paying out over $2 per unit in distributions during the year. So our balance sheet is compounding at an attractive rate. Overall, our balance sheet generated cash ROE of 21% for 2014. As Craig mentioned, our distribution in the fourth quarter is $0.35 per unit, which includes $0.18 of fee and yield earnings, $0.15 of realized carry, with the remainder coming from realized balance sheet gains. In the third quarter, which was the first full quarter with KFN in our results, fee and yield earnings also contributed $0.18 towards our distribution. So from a cash standpoint, despite the challenging environment, the business has continued to perform and the more recurring part of our distribution held steady. On the realized carry front, our sale of Versatel and WILD in the fourth quarter at 2.8x and 3.3x cost, respectively, contributed to the majority of the $0.15 of cash carry that we reported. In addition, I'd like to give you a preview of the first quarter distribution based upon where we stand today. Since December 31, we closed on the second step on the Alliance Boots transaction, where we received 30% of the proceeds in cash and 70% of the proceeds in stock. We also sold Fotolia, a Europe III investment to Adobe at 2x our cost, after owning the company only two-and-a-half years. We estimate that those exits will contribute approximately $0.22 to the first quarter distribution, $0.20 will come from Boots; and of that amount, $0.14 will come from realized carry and $0.06 will come from balance sheet gains. The other $0.02 will come from the realized cash carry associated with the Fotolia transaction. Finally, in terms of AUM and fee-paying AUM as of December 31, our assets under management were $99 billion and fee-paying assets under management were $83 billion. Both figures benefited from $500 million of investment activity in Direct Lending II, and first closing of $2 billion of capital and Infrastructure II, and $1.6 billion in Europe IV. Since December 31 we raised an additional $700 million for Europe IV bringing the total fund size to date to $2.3 billion. And keep in mind, these figures do not reflect approximately $6 billion of committed capital, that will be included in AUM, once it's invested. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. I'm going to talk about four topics today: the fourth quarter, the full year 2014, the energy opportunity and how our businesses are developing. Before I hit those four, let's talk about our business model. We are a bit different. Our model of marrying third-party capital, which always comes first, with our balance sheet and capital markets businesses, allows us to generate more cash flow in return for all of us as shareholders from every investment we make. To put a finer point on it, our balance sheet and capital markets business has generated over $1 billion of our two $2 billion of cash flow last year. And the AUM we manage for third parties generated about $1 billion or the other half of our total cash flow. Given our model is different, we think you should analyze us differently. Ours is not just an AUM-driven model. We do not believe that attractive opportunities are endless. Given that view, when we find an opportunity we like, we want to monetize as much of that opportunity as we can for our fund investors and for all of us as shareholders. Our model allows us to do that. We believe the best metric to judge our performance is our total distributable earnings, our total cash flow that we generate. For the fourth quarter, our cash flow is $376 million and for the full year it was $2 billion. As Craig and Bill mentioned, our cash flow was up 40% in 2014 over 2013, and our distribution per unit was up 36%. In addition, the more recurring component of our distribution, our fee and yield earning, was up over 50% year-over-year. So on our most important cash metrics, we're making good progress. With that, let's turn to the fourth quarter. Compared to our expectations, we performed well on all metrics, except for economic net income, which was impacted by unrealized mark-to-market declines in our balance sheet energy and credit portfolios. We also saw a write-up in our two largest investments, First Data and Walgreens Boots Alliance. First, let me hit on energy. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $900 million of our $13.5 billion total balance sheet in energy-related investments. Those assets were more heavily weighted to our natural resources strategy, which we acquired as part of the KFN acquisition and some seed assets from our energy income and growth strategy. Those two strategies purposely take commodity exposure and use hedging programs to seek to protect our near-term economics and cash flows. The underlying assets themselves are performing. The on-balance sheet energy portfolio generated $90 million of cash in the quarter and over $120 million of cash for the full year. And Q4 included gains of $35 million from the sale of a drilling investment at an IRR of over 50%. So for the metric we care most about, the energy portfolio was a strong contributor to total distributable earnings, accounting for 14% of the cash flow from our balance sheet for the year, while representing only 7% of our total balance sheet investments. We marked down the energy portfolio yearend as a result of the precipitous decline in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices. Keep in mind that public oil and gas companies with market values below $1 billion fell on average almost 50% in the fourth quarter. Valuations as of December 31 were largely derived from a discounted cash flow analysis. The net result of this approach is a $240 million write-down of the energy portfolio in the quarter in private markets, where those same assets generated $90 million of cash flow in the quarter. As a result of our approach, the valuations are sensitive to the underlying commodity price assumptions at a point in time. So we expect our mark-to-market to move with commodity prices, both up and down. While we believe mark-to-market is important, we're going to remain focused on underlying asset performance, including the cash flow we're all getting from the portfolio. The second area worth mentioning is credit. We had about $120 million write-down in our balance sheet credit portfolio this quarter, about $70 million of this was from the CLO equity we have on balance sheet and the rest was non-CLO credit assets that we hold. The contributing factors were loan market declines in the quarter, a small amount of energy exposed assets and credit selection. Here again, the portfolio is generating good cash flow for us, $40 million in the quarter and $118 million for the year. So those were the two big contributors to our lower ENI this quarter. The third important contributor in the fourth quarter was First Data and Walgreens Boots Alliance. We wrote-up our investment in First Data by 12%, and we also saw an increase in value in Walgreens in the quarter. These two items combined contributed approximately $230 million of earnings in aggregate in Q4. Now to the second topic of the full year 2014. 2014 was a great year for us. I mentioned a 35% to 40% increase in cash flow and our dividend, but we also saw an 11% increase in our book value per share and a 55% increase in our fee and yield earnings. We generated strong returns in exits for our Fund LPs, had a record year for our capital markets business with revenues up 50% and generated a 21% cash return on equity. Private equity performance continues to be strong. Our private equity portfolio outperformed the MSCI World in 2014 by over 700 basis points, and this highlighted our key investments are performing. If you look at our other non-PE strategy, returns for 2014 were also strong. Infrastructure was up 13%, real estate was up 17% and in public markets our direct lending, mezzanine and special situations funds had annual returns of 8%, 14% and 24%, respectively. And critically, we were able to use our model of balance sheet, capital markets and third-party capital to increase our participation rate in the value we created, improving our monetization of our best ideas for all of us as shareholders. Now, I'm going to move to the third topic, energy. We're getting asked a lot about energy and the opportunities we're seeing today in the wake of materially lower commodity prices. Our teams are very busy working with companies and management teams that need capital and a thought partner. We believe the opportunity is immense and that our expertise and relationships, both of which we have, will be critical components of success. Our energy and infrastructure platform is now approximately $10 billion across our funds, separate accounts and balance sheet. Of this $10 billion, about $5 billion is dry powder. And we are attacking the opportunity in a cross-firm manner. We have created an energy swat team centrally, with members of our energy, infrastructure, special situations and broader credit and capital markets teams working together to develop distinctive opportunities and optimize the investment of our available capital. While it is still early, we're already active in a number of situations, thus far focusing most heavily on private credit opportunities and drilling partnerships. We went into this downturn very well-positioned. If you look across the firm, direct energy is about 2.5% of private equity fair value, and on the credit side, it's approximately 4% of our AUM. Direct energy is also now 7% of our balance sheet investments. Across our energy focus pools of capital, we have $1.4 billion invested and $2.5 billion of dry powder, so we're well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. The summary is we have substantial capital in addition to the talent, resources, expertise and access to get this right. Now, we need to be smart, patient, but not too patient, and capitalize on this environment. More to come in future quarters on that. The last thing I want to discuss is how our business is developing. As many of you know, in addition to having a unique business model, we've been in the relatively unique position of building a number of new businesses over the last few years. Since 2010, we've created the following business and funds: natural resources, infrastructure, energy income and growth, mezzanine, direct lending, special situations, real estate and China growth. Those eight strategies, or first-time funds, manage $10 billion of committed capital. Performance has been mostly strong. Carry is starting to be generated and we're in the process of raising Fund II for a number of these efforts, including Infrastructure II, where during the fourth quarter we closed on $2 billion and are working towards the final close of $2.5 billion to $3 billion; Direct Lending II and Special Situations II. We also expect several other successive vehicles to get launched this year on the back of good performance and a strong fund raising environment In addition to the Fund I launches over the last few years we acquired Avoca and Prisma and took stakes in Nephila and BlackGold. These investments were accretive and we're pleased with the performance so far. And we're still creating new strategies adjacent to the businesses we've started or acquired, with a near-term launch of our European direct lending and European real estate efforts and two new products in our hedge fund platform. And we continue to invest in growth selectively, recently hiring a real estate credit team to further expand our real estate platform and efforts. Lastly, as you know we've been building a broader sales and marketing team over the last five years. Since we began that effort, we've grown from 300 investors to 825 or so. In addition, we've been increasing the number of investors who trust us in multiple products. In effect, we've been building new relationships, largely by marketing first-time funds over the last few years. We have a lot of opportunity on the distribution front, to find new investors and to cross-sell to existing investors, with the backdrop of successor funds, good performance and a strong fund raising environment. Our firm debt is at an inflection point. We think we are scaling our newer businesses at an opportune time, we're generating strong performance in cash flow from our private equity and capital markets businesses, and our model of balance sheet, capital markets and third-party capital is working. Thanks for joining our call. Operator, please open the line for any questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go ahead and begin the question-and-answer session. Craig, is there anything you would like to add before we open the line?
Craig Larson: Thanks, Andrew. Just looking on the screen, we have quite a few people in the queue, so if everyone could please ask only one question and then get back into the queue, if you have any follow-ups, would be helpful.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Kim: So I know you gave some guidance in terms of thinking about the distribution for the first quarter, but aside from fee-related earnings and realized investment income from KFN, which both seem pretty steady, just trying to frame the longer term upside opportunity, if you will, related to realized cash carry and realized investment income off the balance sheet away from KFN. Just in the context of some of the tailwinds around sizable embedded gains across funds that are seemingly continue to mature. So any color related to that would be helpful?
William Janetschek: I'll give you just a little more color around the distribution for '15. It's hard to predict, but as you did mentioned, I mean one of the main reasons why we did that KFN transaction was to have that more recurring distribution component, and so as you know in the third quarter that amounted to $0.18, and in the fourth quarter it was $0.18 as well. And so hopefully, based upon continue to perform, that would be a more regular component of our distribution. Then added to that would be these realizations, so we mentioned the Boots transaction as well Fotolia, but what we also have in the Q when we made this comment either last quarter or the quarter before was we are seeing some strategic opportunities and we announced the Zimmer-Biomet transaction and that is expected to close probably in the second quarter. And if you might have noticed, a week ago we announced a Big Heart Pet Brands transaction with Smucker's where that is a part cash part stock transaction. And once that monetizes, from the cash side, targeted in the second quarter that will add to the recurring, hopefully as we have more of these sales either strategic or secondary throughout 2015. Also, want to point out, if you look at our private equity portfolio, right now about 20% is in public securities, and now that we have the Boots Walgreen's transaction pro forma for that, it's about 30%. So during the quarter, if the secondary market is available, we also have ways to monetize some of our positions that way.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz from Citi.
Bill Katz: It's Bill Katz. Just coming back to the performance metrics in terms of managing credit, just sort of curious, when you look across your peers, you give some good absolute returns. I was sort of wondering how you performed at a relative basis? And what if any impact might this have on capital raising in '15? Obviously, it paint a very optimistic brush, but wondering tactically if there's any headwinds here?
Scott Nuttall: I think if you break it into individual components, the overall credit performance we've had continues to be top cortile versus across virtually every strategy we managed. And so we can see a good fund raising pipeline for our credit efforts. We mentioned the Direct Lending II closed, Special Situations II is in the market, and we've actually been very active issuers in the CLO market as well. So I would take the marks in Q4 as moment in time marks. The overall loan market was down in Q4, so if you look through the credit marks, we're about $17 million right down in our CLO book. Given, we have about at $1.5 billion give or take of CLO exposure on the balance sheet, that's 4 to 5 points in the quarter. Most of which frankly is explained by just the market trading off a bit, given the leverage in those underlying structures. So credit, I'd say, a good fund raising pipeline and we are optimistic about our ability to scale in that business both in the CLO front and alternative front. In energy, you really have to break it into its component parts. The strategies that led to the mark down in the quarter are relatively small strategies for us in terms of our third-party AUM. So you're really talking about our energy income and growth fund, which is about 25% invested, so we have a lot of dry powder to invest into this dislocation. And we think that that is going to provide us with some very interesting return opportunities on a go-forward basis. And if you look at the portfolio broadly across our direct energy exposure, even the $700 million or so direct energy that we have on balance sheet, that portfolio was really down net 15% for the year. So we generated a lot of cash flow. We had some positive marks in prior quarters. So if you isolate Q4, obviously you get one answer, but I think if you look for the whole year, you get a different one. And our perspective is that we feel pretty well-positioned, given how much dry powder we have across the franchise in energy.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt: It looked like there was a pretty big uptick in the dividend and interest income sequentially from the third quarter. Was there any kind of one-time item in there that drove that? Or is the reinvestment of kind of the KFN assets is starting to kick into the higher yielding type strategies? I don't know if you can walk us through maybe what the key drivers of that improvement were?
William Janetschek: Some of that was performance and some of that is just recurring distributions from the assets that we're managing. Obviously, you said it, that to the extent that that portfolio gets larger, and we're generating the same return, that distribution will be higher quarter-over-quarter. But there really isn't anything big embedded in that number, which would be something I'd want to call out.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer.
Chris Kotowski: Just looking at Page 11 in the press release and your on-balance sheet energy exposure, the cost basis, I mean that we see that the fair value went down, but the cost basis went up by about $104 million in the most recent quarter. And so I'm wondering, a, can you break that down? Was that one investment? Was that the bunch of different things? And then, b, given all the kind of cash flow that you're going to be generating from Boots and Biomet, and God willing, U.S. Foods in the coming year, how much of the cash that's created by those maturing investments would you be willing to reinvest in the energy sector?
William Janetschek: I'll take this first. So when you look at energy, you are right, you can see the cost going up by roughly a $100 million-plus. That's really from two of the strategies in our energy platform. One is, what we call PDP, proved developed producing, and we've actually invested roughly about $60 million in that strategy with FDL, a new relationship we have in that space. And then the other $40 million-plus is investments that we're making side-by-side with the energy income growth fund, in what I would say, drilling assets.
Chris Kotowski: And then just as a point of clarification, the Alliance Boots gain that you cited for the first quarter, that's just on the cash portion, isn't it? And can you remind us of how much of the shares you're going to own, both on balance sheet and the funds.
William Janetschek: And so the number that I gave you as far as that distribution, the $0.20, I mentioned, is just in relationship to the cash. I mentioned in prepared remarks that when the transaction closed in second step, 70% was in stock and 30% was in cash. And so the number I gave you just represents that 30% tranche.
Scott Nuttall: Just one thing to add on, just to clarify. So if you look at Page 11, which you brought us to, really energy shows up in a couple of places. First, is in the private equity section. So if you look at the funds, energy is about 3% of our look-through exposure for our balance sheet in the private equity funds, direct energy. If you look at the co-invest line, which you see shows up at about $3.1 billion of fair value, energy is less than 1% of that co-invest line. And to be clear, Samson is now held at $0.05 on the $1, and so that's been written down over the course of the last 18-plus months, so that economic write-off is largely behind us. And then the other place it obviously shows up is the $695 million we have in the direct energy line in that table, which really is a combination of the assets that builds up.
Chris Kotowski: Maybe you can't say, but within the case of First Data, you've willing to make follow-on investments in attempts to kind of restructure the balance sheet, and is that an option for Samson, if you can say?
Scott Nuttall: We're really not going to comment on individual companies.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Maybe, Scott, if you could walk through, I guess just a little bit more granularly, the drivers of the write-downs on the CLO book, the $70 million, and then the non- CLO credit assets, I think you mentioned the loan market declined to energy and then credit selection on that $50 million. If you could just maybe get a little bit more granular on that? And then what you think the outlook is coming into the first quarter for that?
Scott Nuttall: So I think here is how we think about it. Let's focus on the CLOs first. As I mentioned, we've got about a $1.5 billion of our balance sheet in CLO equity, its combination of newer transactions and then older runoff books, so they're levered at about 5.5x on average. And in Q4, what you really saw was, as I mentioned, the $70 million write-down, which equates to 4 to 5 points in the quarter. That same portfolio generated about $40 million of cash flow in the quarter, which is inline with our expectations. So think of it as about $30 million net. So the mark-to-market, most of that was market movements. So if the loan market is off 50 basis points or 60 basis points and you think about sitting underneath 5.5x leverage, you can get a sense for how much comes from just the market trading off on broad basis, but also there is some positions that frankly we like more than the market, and the market traded down a bit in the quarter and that explains the rest. But we are still believers in those underlying names. For the total year, the CLO performance has been very strong. We generated $120 million of cash flow from the CLO portfolio for the eight months, since the KFN acquisition closed. So if you think about that on a cash yield basis, its about 11.5% cash yield for the year. So I'd say, overall that KFN portfolio, including the CLO equity has cash flowed in excess of our expectation since closing. In terms of the non-CLO exposure, there is really nothing too much to point to. There is one or two investments that have derivative exposure to the energy markets that we think appropriately, and we think ultimately, hopefully will prove to be conservative. It's a moment in time, none of that's realized. What we're really focused on is the cash flow that we're getting from that overall book, which overall credit portfolio last year generated about a 9% cash yield with the CLOs we talked about and alternative credit performing quite well. More broadly on CLOs, Brian, I think one thing that we are focused on, and I think particularly optimistic about, is with the risk-retention rules being adopted in Europe and the U.S. our balance sheet strategy we think positions us well.
Brian Bedell: It sounds like you're continuing to actually try to grow that business on your balance sheet, is that your statement?
Scott Nuttall: Yes, we think we have an opportunity to grow that business and also generate more third-party fee paying capital with the equity that we have exposed to that business. So we could actually, hopefully, overtime raise more third-party assets against the equity that we have underneath these CLOs. So we were quite busy as an issuer last year and I think you'll continue to see us be active this year.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: I was just wondering if you could talk to some of the balance sheet philosophy in the quarter, just in terms of the moving pieces off the balance sheet, realizations, deployment. And then anything you could comment on the forward look in terms of redeploying into some of the higher ROE generating investments, particularly around the KFN as those investments mature.
William Janetschek: I think the general philosophy that we've implemented is one of thinking about how do we generate a very attractive cash return on equity by deploying our balance sheet and raising third-party capital side-by-side, so the general approach we've taken is to look at the cash ROE of every single investment that we make. And we if we can generate as an example an investment opportunity, which we think can have a 15% return, and we can raise capital alongside, that investment that pays us a fee and a carry, if you take the 15% and you have the fee and the carry attached, you get to a 20%-plus cash return on equity by investing our capital side by side with our limited partners. And so our balance sheet doesn't work in competition with our limited partners. There's no prop team at KKR, it really just invests alongside our limited partners. And so that's the approach that we've taken and we focus on generating an attractive cash ROE and have a diversified set of exposures. And as you look at Page 11 of the press release you'll see how we've diversified the book across our different asset classes. But the simple way to think about it is our balance sheet is our own largest investor in everything that we do. What we have been doing is also operating the business with some liquidity and some liquid investments where we can access more liquidity. So to your point, when we see dislocations like we're seeing right now in the energy space, we can rotate capital into those opportunities, both to be able to capitalize on short-term investments that we think are attractive and also to see new strategies that allow us to hopefully accelerate the third-party capital raising that allows us to exploit the opportunity, and so that's how we've been approaching it. The KFN transaction gave us more capital, with which to implement that strategy and more liquidity with which to do as well. And so, so far it's behaving as expected.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr: So I guess my question is looking for a walk-through kind of like the way you did for energy for us across Europe. You have several funds. They're in the build mode. Curious on how much dry powder do you have across the funds and what you're seeing the, what I would call, just economic malaise and some volatility over there?
William Janetschek: With the focus side, you cut out there for a second, Glenn. Your focus is on Europe?
Glenn Schorr: On the European funds, the dry powder they have across the funds and your investment outlook across the funds, given what I would just call economic malaise?
Scott Nuttall: I'd be happy to take you through it. So let's maybe go through it. This is the high-level first, then I'll take you through kind of by business. I'd say the economic picture in Europe is a bit more positive than it's been, right. So we've got low oil, low euro, expansionary monetary policy, consumer sentiments seems to be getting a bit better, and so the overall macro picture feels a bit better. The risk is obviously much more political, but we think a lot of that's priced in. We're seeing opportunities in private equity. We need to be selective, given that the markets are competitive, but we're seeing opportunities there. And where we see a big opportunity is in private credit in Europe, which I'll come back in a minute to how we're thinking about that. So a lot of opportunities coming out of the low oil price particularly, benefiting our credit business. Real estate, both continent and Germany are also attractive and so we're continuing to be quite active on the ground in Europe. To your question about how are we set up to be able to take advantage of the opportunity, it's in the few different ways. First, it pertains to our private equity business. And so we had finished investing our Europe III funds last year and we're in the process of raising Europe IV. Bill mentioned where we stand in terms of that capital raise, but where we are today x investment from employees is about $2.3 billion, give or take that we've raised thus far for Europe IV. And we have been seeding that fund on the balance sheet and doing some investments on balance sheet that are getting dropped into that fund now that we've had our first closing. If you think across private markets we are also investing in Europe through our infrastructure funds, and so we've got available capital in Infra II, where we've thus far closed on $2 billion. We've also been investing there through our real estate funds. And our first real estate fund has actually filled this European basket, and so we've been quite busy. And as I mentioned, we'll be raising some money for real estate Europe in a dedicated format and before then we'll probably be doing some of those transactions on balance sheet for dropping those down into a fund. If you go into the credit side of the business, we have quite a bit of available capital. Our special situation strategy has an ability to invest heavily in Europe. And if you look at the first Special Sits fund, it was a significant area of investment for that fund, which has performed very nicely so far. We're raising a European direct lending vehicle, because we think the private credit opportunity is so significant. And then overtime I think we'll have our other alternative credit pools that will allow us to access the opportunity on the ground. So we think we're particularly well-situated. We've got the teams in Europe working together cross-functionally and cross-asset class to take advantage of the opportunity. And we'll be judicious, but we have capital to take advantage of what we think will be an interesting few years.
Glenn Schorr: One just quick follow-up on the European direct lending vehicle, who is the target market? What size client base are we looking at?
Scott Nuttall: I guess, it depends if you're talking investors or companies we -- 
Glenn Schorr: Investments being made -- sorry, loans being made.
Scott Nuttall: Think of it as similar to our U.S. direct lending strategy. So it's largely going to be middle-market corporates that have good companies, bad capital structures, their traditional lending institutions are busy elsewhere. And so we've been able to build some of those relationships and step-in on the private credit front, but think of it as mid-market corporates largely.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee from KBW.
Robert Lee: In public markets, I guess, one or two things. It did look like, I think, the way you disclosed it, the redemptions from fund investors, it looked like they picked up in the quarter. And I don't know if you maybe give some color around, which strategies maybe you saw some pickup there, if there was maybe seasonality that drove it? And I guess related to that, maybe an update on Prisma, its performance last year, and if that's at all impacting some of the fund redemptions?
William Janetschek: Before we actually go into fund redemptions and distributions, I just want to highlight that we actually did raise $2.2 billion during the quarter just in public market, and that came from the mix of additional capital being raised in special situations as well as CLOs, Direct Lending II, and we actually raised about $400 million in that number for Prisma. What you see on the distribution side is, and I'll give you a high-level component, we had a maturity of a CLO for $600 million. We actually have now committed funds on the public market side and as we sell those investments and we return both gain and cost, you see that reduction as well, and that's a component of that distribution of roughly about $300 million. But more to your point, we actually saw redemptions in Prisma of about $900 million this quarter. I do want to point out, though, that in the first quarter, we actually saw an inflow coming in for Prisma in the first week of $400 million. So when you think about it, and that's why I went through the contribution as well, it's $300 million in the fourth quarter plus another $400 million in the first couple of weeks in the first quarter of '15 with redemptions of $900 million. So we lost a little capital to manage, but still feel quite optimistic about the Prisma strategy.
Scott Nuttall: The only thing I'd add Robert is, look, I think a lot of that, the Prisma number, is just timing. Actually, it was the same investor for a lot of the money that redeemed out of one place in their structure and invested new money out of another. It just so happened, the redemption fell in Q4 and the investment is following in Q1. So I think that's probably why it looks a little elevated relative to what you would expect.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Carrier from Merrill Lynch.
Michael Carrier: I guess this is for either Scott or Bill. When we think about the balance sheet investments, just want to get a sense, and I know a quarter doesn't make a trend, and if we look over the past two to three years, the returns have been very attractive. But when you guys are making those investments, how do you think about either concentration limits you're hedging in certain exposures? I guess just if we're going to be in a more volatile environment, I'm just trying to understand how you guys look at the balance sheet versus investments in funds, given a certain strategy that LPs are looking for? And then just one, like, follow-up on that. Just given the nuance and the difference in performance on investment income versus performance fees, just wanted to understand like what drove that? Meaning, was it just the certain exposures on balance sheet versus the funds or was there anything else driving that?
Scott Nuttall: Let me try to take that. I mean I think the way that we look at the balance sheet investments is, one, we have an asset allocation policy that we put in place. We have a balance sheet committee of the firm that oversees how the balance sheet is deployed. And really a lot of what we're doing with the balance sheet is investing alongside our limited partners in fund format. So we're making investments in those vehicles, tracking the ROE, as I mentioned in the answer to an earlier question. We do have concentration limits within that asset allocation policy, and we have been obviously looking at how we're exposed across the portfolio. We do call out for you in the table, a couple of the bigger exposures, for example, First Data and Walgreens are two of our biggest investments on the balance sheet. So where we kind of go above a certain number, we want to make sure we call that out for you. Hedging is something that we have used both at the strategy level. And I mentioned that we do use hedging as it pertains to our natural resources and energy income and growth investments. And that we'll also periodically do hedging for the balance sheet as a whole, and so we do implement those strategies. I guess the way I think about it is it's hard in our business with our firm to look at any given quarter. If you think about what happened last year, the book value per share went from $10.83 to $12.07 over the course of the year, so it was up about 11%. And that's after we paid out, it was about $2 in cash dividends for the year. So away from those dividends, the balance sheet would be $14-plus book value per share. And so although we did have marks in the quarter, we tend to look at how we're doing point-to-point year-to-year. And we're actually very pleased with how the balance sheet has been performing, both on an absolute basis, and then also how it's facilitating our ability to raise third-party capital and monetize our capital markets capabilities as well, where we also use our balance sheet. So that gives you a little bit of flavor for it. In terms of the investment income versus performance fees, Craig, why don't you take that?
Craig Larson: Yes, sure. Look I think Mike if you look at when you think through carry funds and when you look at invested capital within the real assets, you actually see, the largest component of that is our infrastructure investments. It's actually a little over half of that total amount of invested capital. And so one of other stats that Scott had talked about in terms of the script, and the performance of the infrastructure was highlighting that infrastructure, those investments were actually up 13% in 2014. So what we actually have, when you compare that versus the balance sheet on Page 11, is you do see little bit of a mix. So when you look on Page 11, you see that we're more heavily skewed in terms of the balance sheet investments more towards direct energy as opposed to the infrastructure piece. So I think that probably is the central thing as it relates to the difference you're seeing.
William Janetschek: And Michael, just really quickly, when you think about performance fees and you talk about balance sheet, you see an increase in performance in PE, and so that's going to drive the performance fee. However, when you take a look at the two assets that we're managing, third-party capital, KNR and its energy income, both of those funds, energy income is pretty close to cost, it's a new strategy. KNR is actually below cost. And so as those assets are marked down for the capital that we're managing, you're not going to see that hit our performance fee. So as Scott mentioned, when you look at balance sheet performance, we made money in PE that was offset by energy. When you look at our performance fee, we still carry on our PE, but didn't have the write-down with respect to any sort of performance fee offset on those energy assets.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.
Patrick Davitt: More broadly on the excitement around the investment opportunity in energy. I guess, I'm curious, is there a house view on where prices are going? And how do you get comfortable that you're not catching a falling knife by throwing a lot of money into that market right now?
Scott Nuttall: That's a great question, Patrick. I think house view -- no, we're not in the business of predicting commodity prices per se. But I will give you a little bit of color that it does feel to us like we're in the second inning in terms of how this is playing out, and so we're being cautious. As I mentioned, we've kind of organized this internal swat team across businesses and across geographies to make sure that we're attacking this holistically. I think one of the ways to make sure you're not catching a falling knife is focus on where you're investing in the capital structure. And so the two areas where we've been most busy thus far is in private credit, where largely the opportunities are of the second lien variety. So you're behind a first, but you're still somewhat secured. And we feel that a lot of the structures that we're going to be able to put in place, they will protect us against a commodity price path that's very hard to predict. So we're trying to move up the capital structure. And the other thing that we're doing is working on drilling partnerships, where there are some market participants who have drilling rights and don't have access to the capital to actually begin the drilling, and without drilling they'll lose the rights. And so we think we can structure those deals as well to protect ourselves relative to the underlying commodity. Really, if you look back, I mean 2012 through 2014 was largely a time to sell into the energy froth, and now we're kind of viewing it as largely a good time to invest, but we want to be cautious about how we do it. So we're making sure we're doing it in a way where we're protected.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee from KBW.
Robert Lee: Scott, I just really wanted to follow-up. You I guess in your original comments had mentioned about the expansion in the number of LPs and more LPs I guess buying multiple products. So maybe kind of drilldown into that a little bit, just would be interested in a little bit more incremental color, how you're seeing kind of the demand, U.S. versus non-U.S., how that's kind of shifting for you guys? And also be interested in getting a little more color on how maybe the LP set or investors set is shifting itself may be away from U.S. public pensions, kind of what's the contribution currently from high net worth and maybe sovereign wealth funds, that type of thing?
Scott Nuttall: I'd say a couple of comments. One, we have been investing heavily in building out our relationships around the world. We finished the year with about, literally, 824 investors. That was up about 19% year-over-year. We've kind of got a cross-sell stat that is still 1.6 products per investor. That has actually held quite steady over the course of the last few years, which if you think about it, is hard to keep it steady if you're adding all these investors, usually with one product. So we've been able to keep it at 1.6x. And hopefully we can continue to achieve that or grow it. If you look at some of our bigger investors, our biggest investors actually on average have between 3.5 and 4 products with us. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity on that cross-sell statistic. Another statistic we look at is what percent of our investors are actually in more than one product with us today, which is just another way of looking at the progress we're making. And there again, we see a lot of opportunity. We have about a-third of our investors in more than one product, so if you think about that 1.6, it's heavily concentrated in the third, and then we have two-thirds that are in one product with us. So we think that we have a lot of opportunity to continue to increase the total number of investors we have and also increase the number of products that we're selling to the investors that do trust us today. In terms of the LP set and how it's shifting, a couple comments on that. I think we have always enjoyed great relationships with pension funds in the United States. We continue to see a lot of support from that group, which we're grateful for. But if you look at kind of where we've seen a couple of developing trends, one has been sovereign wealth funds. So there has been more activity in Asia, Middle East, parts of Europe, in that regard. And then also, the retail or the individual investor, those high net worth mass affluent. And on that statistic, it's worth sharing, over the last two years, just shy of 20% of the money we raised, I think it's 19% of the money we've raised globally, has come from individuals, direct high net worth and through platforms. And so we continue to see that opportunity continue to grow. So I would say overall, the global set is increasing. And number of investors around the world, if you look where we raise money, has become increasingly global, and it's moved from just institutions to institutions and individuals.
Craig Larson: If I were to just add on in terms of some of the other broad trends that we're thinking of when we look at the fund raising numbers, I guess, I'd point to four things within that. It was certainly an active for us and we raised a little over $14 billion in fee paying AUM. First point, I'd say, is really the breadth and diversity, which I think you got a good sense of from Scott. Only about 10% of that actually came from one of our benchmark private equity funds, because we were fund raising for North America or Asian private equity, so that only includes that initial close from Europe IV. And when you look at that, about $9 billion of it came from public markets, which almost definitionally are newer strategies for us, that's up from $7.9 billion a year before. Second thing is on Europe IV, which we've spoken about, but we're pleased to have the first closing on E-IV. And Bill mentioned that the $1.6 that's in the numbers with subsequent closings were at $2.3 billion, or if you include employees at about $2.5 billion. So that's nice to see. Third point, and this is actually an important one, is one of the things we talked about for some time is the scaling of our first-time funds. And the opportunity that we have with performance to scale these, and there are some good data point. So Infra I was $1 billion fund. Infra II we've now raised to and we're working towards the final close of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Direct Lending II, we've held a second close and we're already at 2.5x Fund I. Special Situations II, early days, we're pleased with our progress. And obviously Special Situations, as a strategy, has been among our best performing. Special Sits I was up 24% in the year. And then the fourth thing, are those additional statistics. The number of LP is up 19%, it's a great stat. We see continued flows into CCT or private BC, which as of yearend was just over $3 billion, and that's all with shadow AUM, as Bill talked about, being at about $6 billion. So you put that altogether, and I think it's a good story.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.
Devin Ryan: Most of my questions were asked, but just a question on transaction fees. I know that they were light in the quarter with very little in private markets. And that can be lumpy, but how should we think about the backlog and trajectory there? And then within capital markets, can you maybe give a little more detail around the outlook for that business, looking out over the next year? I know, it's a smaller driver, but you're coming off of a big year of growth, so any additional perspective or context would be helpful.
William Janetschek: Devin, this is Bill. I'll tackle the first part of that question which is transaction fees. You are right, the transaction fees this particular quarter in private markets was pretty light, owing to the fact that we deployed only approximately $800 million in the quarter, and of that $800 million only $300 million came from private equity. We did deploy capital in energy, and in energy we typically don't take a transaction fee. And that's why, even though you're looking at $800 million number, the ability to take a transaction fee is actually even on a much lower number. As it relates to the first quarter, second quarter, we generally don't give a lot of guidance, but we do have several investments that we have signed either in the fourth quarter or the first month of 2015. And I would say that the total enterprise value of those transactions is roughly about $2 billion. So as those investments close, you'll see the transaction fees flow through our P&L. As it relates to capital market, I'll turn that over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Yes, Devin, it's hard to give you much guidance on the capital markets revenues frankly. To think about the business, 70% last year was related to KKR deal activity and 30% was our third-party business. So it's going to move in line with frankly our deal activity as a firm, private equity and other asset classes, and also how we do in terms of continuing to build relationships with third-parties. We've invested in origination capabilities on the third-party front, so we're hopeful we can continue to scale our efforts there. But it is very difficult to give you any sense for where things go until we see how the pipeline develops and how deal activity develops for the firm through the course of this year. But we'll keep you updated in terms of color.
Operator: And our last question for today is going come from the line of Bill Katz from Citi.
Bill Katz: You sort of talked about this a little bit. I'm sort of curious, Scott, when you think about the cash ROE opportunity for the balance sheet in 2015, you obviously have some investments versus realizations and some mix of dynamics going on as well. What do you think is a reasonable target for '15, given all these closed cards?
Scott Nuttall: We don't have a target, Bill, per se. And as you know, we don't share guidance or our budgets. I think what I would point to is a couple of things. One, as we talked about, there is an increasing percentage of our cash flow, which is now something that you can more or less count on quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at that fee and yield earnings statistic that we shared with you, that $0.18 that we shared, we think that is something to continue to stay focused on, and we're focused on continuing to grow that. So the baseline of recurring cash we have will continue to grow. And so that's something that we're quite focused on as a firm. The second thing that I would point you to is how our private equity portfolios continue to mature. Over 50% of our private equity portfolio is now marked at 1.5x cost or more. That statistic continues to increase quarter-to-quarter, which is something that we watch, and that should provide us with more opportunities for exits on a go-forward basis, which obviously will also contribute to the cash ROE. And as a consequence of the maturation of the private equity portfolio, it's also the case that our private equity portfolio on our balance sheet is continuing to mature. So it's very hard to predict, as I say, quarter-to-quarter or even completely year-to-year with respect to where cash is going to come from. But if you look for 2014, and this is the metric we focus most on, our cash flow, our TDE was $2 billion, and that was up 40% from 2013. And it's really come from a variety of different places, fee and yield, carry, balance sheet gains. And we're hopeful that, as we continue to implement our strategy of balance sheet, capital markets and third-party capital, we'll continue to have a lot of ways to win and a lot of ways to generate quite a bit of cash flow, which should result in a very attractive cash ROE.
Bill Katz: Can I ask just one more, if you don't mind? There has been a lot of sort of back and forth in the media about the regulatory backdrop and the relationship between the GP and the LP. Maybe step back and just holistically talk a little bit about where you are in terms of any type of fee concessions or pricing shifts relative to LP demands?
William Janetschek: Craig, why don't you take that one?
Craig Larson: Yes, sure. Bill, look given the recent articles in the press and let me answer things, your first point in terms of regulatory environment and the backdrop of that generally, before we talk about things like fee pressures. Given the recent articles in the press, specifically on the topic of some refunds to our LPs, we thought a question like this might come up, but to add, I thought it'd be helpful to add some thoughts. First, we have interactions with various regulators and this includes the SEC, where our dialogs are ongoing. And as I know you'll appreciate, we don't plan to detail these on a call. In terms of these recent articles, we refunded about $800 million to our LPs in early 2014, and that was in connection with a routine SEC exam in 2013 of one of our registered investor advisors. Now, the majority of this amount related to the allocation of expenses, between what we call our flagship private equity funds and co-investment in other vehicles that invest alongside of those funds. We can't comment now on what additional developments may occur on this in the future, but we look at our reserve each quarter, and as of yearend believe we're adequately reserved for our legal risks. Obviously, if and when, there are any material updates, we disclose them as you'd expect is appropriate. And on this topic, unfortunately, there really isn't much else beyond this that we're going to be able to comment on other than saying, look, certainly we take our fiduciary responsibilities to our fund LPs very seriously. So these types of issues are very important to us.
William Janetschek: As relates to fee pressure, remember, keep in mind that at KKR, transaction to monitoring fees either gets shared with your LPs, 80% to the LP or 20% to KKR or we also have an option where LPs could pay us an incremental amount of management fee and they could capture 100% on the transaction monitoring fees. And so when you think about fee pressure, taking a fee or not taking a fee, when you're selling an investment where if it's profitable investment its going 80/20, as opposed to you taking the transaction fee or monitoring fee, where again the economic is going to 80/20, its really not applicable to KKR, because of the fee sharing arrangements that we currently have and will continue to have with our LPs.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, that's all the questions that we have for today, I'd like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks. End of Q&A
Craig Larson: Thank you, everybody, for listening to the call. To the extent you have any follow-up questions, please naturally follow-up with us directly and we'll speak with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, again, for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program. And you may all disconnect your telephone lines. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Stephanie. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. And this call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. And finally, please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. To begin, I would like to highlight a new table on Page 2 of our press release titled Key Metrics. These are summary statistics that track the financial performance of the firm. We thought that having this information all in one place would be helpful as we discuss our performance every quarter. Focusing first on our cash metrics. We had a strong quarter with fees, realized cash carry and net realized investment income, all increasing nicely on a year-over-year basis contributing to total distributable earnings of $505 million, up over 100% from the third quarter last year. This translates into $0.59 of distributable earnings per unit net of taxes and $2.03 per unit year-to-date. These figures are 84% and 60% above the corresponding figures for 2013. And turning to the distribution, we've announced a third quarter distribution per unit of $0.45, up 96% year-over-year bringing our year-to-date distributions to $1.55 per unit, which compares to the $0.92 distributed through the first 9 months of last year. Focusing on economic net income, we reported third quarter after-tax ENI of $419 million, which equates to $0.50 of after-tax ENI per unit. And finally, we wanted to remind everyone that this is the first full quarter with KFN’s results running through our financial statements, and the impact of the KFN acquisition is particularly evident in our cash flow metrics. Fee and yield earnings. So fee-related earnings plus net interest and dividends were $208 million for the quarter and $525 million for the first 9 months of 2014, 98% and 79% higher than the corresponding periods of 2013. These increases were driven by both the strong fee-related earnings performance this quarter, in addition to a full quarter of net interest and dividend contribution from KFN. And from a distribution standpoint, of the $0.45 distribution, the after-tax fee and yield component, so the more recurring portion of our distribution, was $0.18 this quarter versus $0.10 in the third quarter of 2013. In talking about the KFN transaction, we've highlighted for some time, how KFN would help the more recurring component of our cash flow profile, and we've seen this flow through into our financial results this quarter, as KFN contributed $53 million or $0.07 per share of cash earnings in the third quarter. And with that, I will turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial performance in more depth.
William J. Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. As of September 30, our assets under management were $96 billion and fee-paying assets under management were $81 billion. Both figures were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter; however, our AUM and fee-paying AUM are up 7% and 11% from the same time last year. Keep in mind, these figures do not reflect $4.8 billion of committed capital that will be included in AUM once it's invested. Turning to our segments. In Private Markets, our private equity portfolio appreciated 2.2% in the third quarter, outperforming the MSCI World, which was down 2.1% and the S&P 500, which was up 1.1%. This was less than the 5% appreciation we had in the second quarter, which caused the decline in performance income quarter-over-quarter. However, this was offset by higher investment income, translating into ENI of $399 million, up 6% from the second quarter. Moving to Public Markets. ENI in this segment was $48 million, down from $106 million last quarter, because of our mark-to-market investment performance was better in the second quarter than it was in the third. However, our net cash interest and dividend increased $20 million in the third quarter because, as Craig mentioned, this is our first full quarter with KFN running through our financials. Also, this is the second time that Public Markets has contributed to our cash carry. And the $10 million of realized carry in Public Markets in the third quarter contributed about a penny to $0.18 of cash carry. Touching on Capital Markets. We reported third quarter ENI of $62 million, over 3x the $20 million we reported in the second quarter. This jump was driven by increased transaction fees, largely from the First Data equities indication. 2014 has been a record year so far for KCM, with year-to-date fees up over 75% to $184 millIon. Through September 30, fee-related earnings were $125 million, 70% above last year's figure. Here, our diversification continues to drive the growth in this segment. In 2014, 35% of our revenues are from outside the U.S. and our third-party business contributed over 25% to KCM's year-to-date revenue. We reported a September 30 book value of $12.51 per unit, which is up 24% on a year-over-year basis. Our book value includes a 30% increase in unrealized carry, bringing that figure to $1.2 billion, with about $80 million of that coming from a Public Market segment. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to perform, generating an ROE of 25% and a cash ROE of 23% for the last 12 months, with no net leverage. On the private equity exit front. In the third quarter alone, we realized investments across the U.S., Europe and Asia, resulting in over 10 monetization events that returned $2 billion to our fund investors, including the sale of a 45% stake in Visma out of Europe, a final secondary of Modern Dairy in Asia and the sale of Ipreo in the U.S. This activity helped drive our $0.45 distribution in the third quarter, $0.07 of which came from KFN. This $0.45 includes $0.18 of fee and yield earnings; $0.18 of realized carry, with the remainder coming from realized balance sheet gains. Since June 30, we've also announced exits in Versatel and Wild, both from our Europe III Fund and the second step of the Alliance Boot transaction. And we have pending exits in U.S. Foods environment in the U.S., all of which assuming September 30 evaluations will lead to future cash carry, if and when they close. Before I wrap up, I want to give you a peek at the fourth quarter distribution based upon where we stand today. Since September 30, we closed 2 of the strategic sales that I just mentioned, Versatel and Wild. And we estimate those 2 exits will contribute about $0.15 to the fourth quarter distribution; $0.13 of that $0.15 will come from realized cash carry and the other $0.02 will come from realized balance sheet gains. And with that, I'll pass it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. Given the volatility over the last few weeks, I am going to spend just a minute today on Q3, but spend most of my time with you today on how we're seeing the world. So regarding the quarter, the bottom line to me is 5 simple points. One, our businesses are performing and scaling well. Two, our investment performance has been strong across all major asset classes and if you dig into the numbers, recent vintage private equity deals are performing especially well. To give you a sense, investments made from 2009 through 2012 have a 27% IRR so far. Three, we're finding interesting investment opportunities globally. Most of our activity in Q3 was outside the United States. In private equity as an example, 70% of new deal activity in the quarter was in Europe and Asia. Four, we're creating exits, especially strategic exits, which are driving our cash carry, which is up over 125% from the first 9 months of 2014. And five, as a result of all this, our year-to-date total distributable earnings are up 75% and our year-to-date distribution per unit is up 68%. So we had a good quarter. Given the volatility you've seen in the market the last few weeks, let's talk about what the current environment means for our existing investments and businesses. We like investing in complex situations when other investors may be nervous. And we are hopeful this environment will lead to more of these opportunities. So if the world gets difficult, we will be ready to capitalize. Before we open it up to Q&A, we thought we would address 2 of your frequently asked questions directly. The first relates to Energy. We manage about $8.7 billion of capital in our Energy and Infrastructure business across funds, separate accounts and our balance sheet. Oil prices have dropped approximately 20% from their June highs, and equities within the energy complex have been under pressure. So let's talk about $80 oil and what this means for our energy business. While falling oil prices can adversely impact some of our existing investments, we feel that our firm's overall oil exposure is limited compared to the available opportunities. The capital needs within the Energy complex are material, and if short-term commodity price swings creates supply/demand imbalances, that is generally good for our business. But let's get more detailed. In terms of invested capital, I'm going to start with private equity. As of September 30, we had over $40 billion of fair value across our private equity funds. And when you look through the numbers, you'll see that only 3% of that $40 billion was in direct energy investments. Looking more closely at our 2006 NAXI funds, direct energy was also about 3% of those funds. So energy is a very modest percentage of our Q3 fair value in private equity. This position was purposeful. It has been our view that over the past 18 months, valuations in Energy PE were too high and that there was too much capital chasing investments. So we expect a drop in values to make the market more sober, significantly broadening our opportunities set going forward. So now let's turn to Real Assets. First, our infrastructure fund. Our infra business is not directly exposed to commodities by design and is currently invested across 5 sectors: Renewables, water and wastewater treatment, communications and infrastructure, district heating and cooling, and parking. All of these are largely unaffected by changes in commodity prices. Also, our investment in Colonial Pipeline is insulated from commodity price movements, given the nature of the underlying contracts. So we have no meaningful oil exposure in infrastructure. Where we do have direct exposure is through our Energy income and growth and Natural Resources funds. These products are purposely exposed to commodities. But let's look at the details. In aggregate, there's about $3 billion of committed capital in these funds. And only $1 billion of the $3 billion is invested. Energy income and growth is a young strategy with a lot of dry powder and KKR Natural Resources is largely exposed to natural gas. And what oil exposure we do have is about 50% hedged. So even in these strategies, we have 2/3 of our relevant capital or $2 billion in dry powder ready to be deployed and little net exposure to oil prices today. We also know a lot of you have questions about the recent volatility in the leverage credit markets and what higher high yield spreads mean for our firm. So let's address that. While the leveraged credit markets have rallied over the past week, high yield spreads are approximately 115 basis points wider in the U.S. and Europe, relative to their lows in June. This change is not expected to have a big impact on our business. We're finding capital for new deals remains available at attractive all-in rates. We still believe we could raise 10 plus billion of financing in this environment at an all-in cost of capital, around 6%. And we have aggressively refinanced our private equity portfolio company's debt over the last few years, so we don't feel that risk in the portfolio. Also, remember, spreads increase, that's overall a good thing for our credit business, which manages $26 billion of non-investment grade credit and has been growing quickly. So overall, we view the latest pullback in markets and energy as a net positive for us, given our long-term locked up capital and dry powder. Let me just spend a minute on how we're seeing the world more broadly. Overall, we continue to see a slow recovery in the U.S. and Europe. This recovery has been very bumpy. And if you think about the last few years, we have had the flash crash, the European contagion, China slowdown, and now an energy pullback and renewed concerns about Europe. We view the last few weeks as the latest bump in an already bumpy road back from the credit crisis and great recession, and are optimistic we can take advantage of the anxiety again by investing into the uncertainty. As investors, slow growth environments with periodic volatility and an overall improving economy has been a good environment in which to deploy capital and a good environment in which to monetize some of our mature investments. And with that, let's open the line to answer more of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And before we take our first question, Craig, is there anything you would like to add.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Stephanie. We -- looks like we have actually a sizable number of people in the queue. So if you could please limit yourself to one initial question and then rejoin the queue if necessary, we'd appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: I guess, my question is a bit more technical in nature, but if I look at the $207 million of total investment income in the third quarter, can you let us know how much of that was from KFN, just trying to get a sense of how that stacks up against the $53 million of net realized investment income from KFN for the quarter. And then, stepping back, how do you see that ratio holding going forward? I think, in the second quarter it was something like 2/3 of KFN's investment income was realized.
William J. Janetschek: Hi Michael, this is Bill. Thanks for the question. As it relates to KFN, you are right in that we do provide some realized information and so in the second quarter we showed in the distribution that $36 million came from KFN and in the third quarter that's $53 million, so roughly about $89 million year-to-date. On a run rate basis, that's a realized return of about 9%. When you take into account unrealized returns, which is embedded in that $207 million, KFN right now is performing much better than we had expected. That being said, KFN is a little complicated because when we closed the transaction, some of the assets were Public Market investments, CLOs, et cetera, while others were Private Market investments, which would have been Real Estate and Energy. The way we look at it is we look at this more holistically because we put all of the results from KFN and KKR proper's balance sheet together, but the bottom line is, from a modeling perspective, the realized income is on pace or a little higher than we had expected and KFN is performing rather well to date.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.: You guys are probably as sophisticated as any in valuing businesses. And I'm curious as to how you value your business and at what price or point would it make sense for you to take some of that, I guess, it's $11.5 billion of cash investments on your balance sheet, which is about 65% of your market cap, to basically buy back your own shares, if you thought they were misvalued or do you think they misvalued?
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Lee. Appreciate the kind comment. This is Scott. I think it's a great question. I think, today, the markets have been -- they are working to figure out how to value our business and other businesses that are somewhat like ours. In terms of how we've thought about it to date, Lee, what we've really been looking at is valuing ourselves the same way that we value companies that we invest in. We like cash flow and we look at the return on capital and the return on equity, overall. And as we've talked to our shareholders about how we think they should think about us, we have emphasized those metrics. Our perspective has been that you can't eat AUM, you can spend cash flow. And so we have been focused on making sure we're driving the total cash flow up and we took you through the numbers, you can see total distributable earnings up 75-plus percent year-to-date. So we're making progress. So far, what we've determined to do is to share that cash flow back with our investors through a high payout ratio. And year-to-date, that's been on the order of 76% of the cash flow we've paid out in the distribution, which has been also increasing rather significantly. When we looked at how to take these trade-offs views before, what we've looked at is year-to-date and over the last few years, our ROE has been 25-plus percent. And so, when we've looked at opportunities to invest capital internally versus buying shares back, we've kind of put it all in the mixer and said, "All right, we can deploy our capital against opportunities we have and generate 25-plus percent returns on that capital," that's a pretty good return. So while we think our stock does not properly reflect the cash flow we generate, we found attractive ways to deploy capital internally and have been to date returning capital to shareholders through a very high payout ratio and a very high dividend. I think you're asking a good question. Is that the right approach for the long-term? And the answer is this is the approach we've taken so far, but we'll continue to look at it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just 2 things. One is the -- in the Public Markets, the unrealized investment losses, the $46 million that we see, is that primarily the mark-to-market on the CLOs and KFN, because you could see that they were marked prior -- slightly above cost in the second quarter and slightly below in the third?
Scott C. Nuttall: That's absolutely right, Chris.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just a kind of bigger picture. In the recent weeks, there were 3 kind of un-KKR like investments, smaller, more ventured capital kind of investments, Magic Leap, Lemon Restaurants, Ping Identity and things that I don't think have been down the center of the fairway for KKR. And can you discuss that strategy and where they fit in the grand scheme of things?
William J. Janetschek: Yes, Chris, happy to. This is Scott. Look, I think, we have found across a number of the different industries that we spend time in, Chris, that periodically we've run across interesting smaller investment opportunities that are more growth equity in nature. Historically, we have passed on those because it didn't fit into a private equity mandate or any of the other strategies that we manage, but we've found many of them to be quite interesting. And so there are some sectors. Technology, retail, healthcare have been those most active. We're now with our balance sheet, we've taken the view that we can actually make some of those investments, which we're doing on balance sheet today. We'll see how this strategy evolves. As you recall, with our Real Estate strategy, that started as an on-balance sheet strategy that we dropped into a fund. We may do that with growth equity down the line and we may not, but think of these as opportunities sourced by our investment teams that historically we passed on and now we have a way to monetize.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.
M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP: You talked a lot about the growth in your strategies that are moving into their second generation of funds. Can you give us an update on where each of those stand in terms of either raising that second generation or starting to raise that second generation?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure, Patrick. So let me just run through a number of different strategies because this also feeds well into kind of what we're doing from a fundraising standpoint in the market. But if you kind of go around the world and across the different businesses, as you know, we recently raised our Asia II Fund for private equity. So that was our private equity successor fund that was about $6 billion. We have a number of Fund II strategies that we're actually in market with now or will be shortly, including infrastructure, our direct lending platform, where we're raising fund to special situations, which is also in the market with Fund II mezzanine II or a private credit II, is also a strategy that we're going to be raising here shortly. So a number of different strategies that we're in the market with Fund II right now. And then, there's others that you'll see coming, including Real Estate. So as you kind of go across all the different strategies, and I think there is 7 or 8 different vehicles that we've built, where we had Fund Is. A number of those have already launched Fund II and more are coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.
Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Scott, can you just address the environment in terms of what you might expect from strategic versus ECM exit outlook? I'm particularly curious how the recent volatility might play into maybe the mix of exits there?
Scott C. Nuttall: Great, happy to, Marc. Look, I think, if you look year-to-date, it's interesting. We've talked about this a lot over the course of last couple of years, that we've been seeing more and more of our exit activity, actually come from strategic exits or dividend recaps, et cetera. And if you look at what's happened year-to-date -- if you look at what's actually closed, secondaries have been about 40% of the cash that we've returned, with strategic and dividend recaps making up the other 60% or so. But if you actually kind of pro forma for a bunch of the strategic sales that we've had, remember, we've had 8 or so strategic sales announced over the course of this year. If you go back to Oriental Breweries, Sunrise, Avincis, Alliance Boots to Walgreens, Biomet, U.S. Food, Wild, Versatel. We've had a lot of strategic sales announced this year and if -- you've got 5 strategic exits, couple of which are now closed, but 3 of which are still pending. If you kind of pro forma the value that we've returned to investors, as a result of all of that, you see about 80% of that is strategic sales or dividend recaps, and only 20% or so is actually from the equity capital markets. So we have a lot of optionality as to how we exit investments and are not dependent on the Public Markets per se. So what's been pleasing for us as we thought the strategic buyers would come back and we are starting to see that come through. And as I said, it's now that and the leverage credit markets are 80-plus percent of what we're returning. So it's moving in the direction we've anticipated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Scott, I appreciate the forward comments on the deployment opportunities. Maybe if you could just go into a little bit more detail, obviously, seeing a little bit of a rebound in the markets here, but if you could talk a little bit about how aggressive you think you might be on deploying capital and then elaborate over the next, say, 1 to 2 quarters and then in 2015. And then also a little bit more detail on the -- on some of the energy opportunities that you touched on.
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Happy to, Brian. Look, I'd say, in terms of deployment, I think, it's important to keep in mind, we're a very global business, okay? So probably half -- over half of our investment teams are outside the United States and as I mentioned, we've actually been very active, in particular, over the course of last couple of quarters in Asia and Europe. And as valuations we felt were a bit high in the U.S, we pulled back a bit, especially in private equity in the U.S. But in terms of what we're seeing right now, I'd say -- let me start with Asia, active. We deployed year-to-date nearly $2 billion in private equity. We've done our second deal in Japan this year. And so we're starting to see that market open up a bit. We bought a stake in a public company in China called Haier. It's somewhere between 3 and 4x EBITDA, as that market was dislocating a little bit, so we were able to take advantage of that. But also if you look across Asia, we've been busy in special situations. And in Real Estate, and -- so we're finding a lot of different opportunities in Asia and are particularly upbeat about the special situations and kind of a rescue opportunity in that market. So I'd say, let's start there. I'd say -- I'd expect us to be quite active on the deployment front as those Capital Markets continue to develop and it's both kind of special assist, direct lending and the other areas that I mentioned. Then I'd go to Europe, the liquid markets had really started to run a bit in Europe. We've seen a bit of a pullback. We did our first deal in Africa this year, so our MENA [ph] strategy is continuing to develop, but we're also continuing to see opportunities in private credit. Special situations, direct lending, we have actually used all the capacity we have in our Real Estate Fund for European investments, so we're going to be launching a Real Estate Europe strategy as a consequence of that, and we've been expanding. We opened an office in Madrid. We're adding talent and we think direct lending type strategies are a great opportunity in Europe. So where there is dislocation, I think, you will continue to see us being very active on the deployment front. In the U.S., as I mentioned, we've been a little bit more cautious as of late, probably, more sellers than buyers in private equity, but we've continue to deploy capital in special situations, direct lending, Real Estate and Energy. So overall, where there is a little bit of fear, we get excited and find opportunity and when valuations are a bit elevated, we have a big portfolio and the opportunity to access the markets. And so, we actually are pleased with the current environment. I think we'll find things to do. In terms of your question around Energy, in particular, look, as I mentioned, we've been pretty quiet in Energy private equity for a long while because valuations had gone up so much. There's some sectors in the Energy market that have traded off in the public markets, 30% to 50%. And that will create opportunities for us, hopefully, going forward. And we're continuing to stay busy in infrastructure, energy-related and otherwise, and also in our drilling and royalty strategies, which are more private market strategies. So this is a little bit of color for you, but it's active.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So quick one on the exits. Bill, you talked about First Data, U.S. Foods and Biomet kind of in the queue. Curious if you guys expect those to close in the fourth quarter, and then if maybe you can help us out with kind of a range of potential dividends that you would expect from those exits?
Scott C. Nuttall: Chris, this is Bill. With regard to the 3 that you mentioned, so I'll take them one by one. U.S. Food, we still haven't gotten clearance yet. We were cautiously optimistic that, that might close in the fourth quarter, but it could actually slip until the first quarter. As far as Biomet is concerned, we're hoping that's going to close in January of 2015, and so that will be a first quarter event. And lastly, on Boots, we're expecting that to take place in the first quarter of '15 as well. As far as giving any guidance on what the cash distribution would be, it's a little complicated and we'd much rather not give that type of guidance because each one of those transactions is part cash and part stock.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.
M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP: I just want to follow-up on my question about the CLO marks. Just -- some of the pushback I get on the story is around perceived credit risk from taking on the KFN portfolio. Just wanted to make sure that, the marks that are occurring are purely market driven and there isn't any sort of credit deterioration going on in this portfolio.
William J. Janetschek: Yes. And Patrick, this is Bill. You're absolutely right. The portfolios are performing fine, but when you have disruption in a credit market on a mark-to-market basis, the CLOs might be marked down, but the underlying performance is still there and nothing that we're worried about right now.
Scott C. Nuttall: And I'd say critically, Patrick, the cash flow coming off the CLOs and overall credit platform is in line with or ahead of our expectations.
William J. Janetschek: Which is why the results for KFN so far, both in the second quarter for the 2 months and the full third quarter, have been a little better than we actually expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess I got back in the queue pretty quick. Scott, thanks for your comments about Energy, that's very helpful. Just had another question about an area that seems to be slowing down and that's China and Asia. Are you guys seeing any stress at all in your portfolio of companies, as a result of things slowing down there -- I mean, it appears no, but just any comments you can give us there would be great.
Scott C. Nuttall: No. Chris, we really haven't seen a slowdown that's noticeable. In fact, our revenue and EBITDA growth in our China portfolio has been good and our overall Asia portfolio has been very good. So remember, we're focused on investing in private companies in China that have exposure to the consumer and so some of what you are seeing in the Public Markets has been disconnected from what we're experiencing in our private companies. So, so far so good on the overall portfolio in Asia, in particular. And we're kind of viewing the dislocation and the slowdown as a buying opportunity for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Appreciate the color on the capital deployment. Just a follow-up, I guess, on that topic. Maybe more on the private side, but clearly, you guys want to put money to work when there is dislocations in the markets, but it hasn't been your experience that in volatile times it becomes harder to actually to get money deployed or to lock down terms just when prices have significant fluctuations? Just curious if -- clearly, you want to get the money into the market, but does it actually become harder to do when the markets are volatile?
Scott C. Nuttall: That's a great question, Devin. So the answer is it depends on how much volatility there is and it depends on the asset class. So if it is extremely volatile and a lot of distress, then private equity, the buys are very attractive when you can make them, but only a few transactions happen if there is extreme distress, because you don't sell unless you absolutely have to, and there's not a lot of those opportunities out there. But where you've got, what we've seen so far, which is this kind of asynchronous recovery, where you've got bumps in the road from time to time, we have actually continued to see deal flow in that environment because it's not such a severe dislocation. So this has been the kind of dislocation where we're continuing to find opportunities as opposed to the market shutting down. But when you go to the other end of the spectrum, you go to our liquid businesses, market dislocation is a very attractive buying opportunity as long as the markets remain somewhat liquid, when their price deterioration and a lot of participants in those markets have short-term capital and we have long-term capital. And in the case of the balance sheet in some of the vehicles that we manage, we actually have permanent capital. So we can take advantage of those dislocations on the liquid side, and that's actually a market where we find that we can make some great buys, if the high-yield market, as an example, pulls back and becomes more attractive. And then, you've got strategies that are in between. Think private credits, special situations, mezzanine, where if companies cannot access capital because of dislocation or a change in behavior from traditional lending institutions, that's a great environment for us. So that's why this environment we've seen over the last few years of overlying kind of improving economic fundamentals, but these periodic periods of volatility are allowing us to be active across a number of our strategies and deploying capital into what we think are some pretty interesting risk/reward opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.
Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.: I don't know if this is an appropriate question, but you guys put a significant amount of additional capital into First Data, and I was wondering if you felt it appropriate to discuss how the company is doing and et cetera.
Scott C. Nuttall: Lee, it's Scott. I think, what we'll probably do on that one, Lee, is leave it to the First Data management to talk about on their earnings call. But you're right, we did deploy significant incremental capital into that company as our largest investment, and I think it's fairly straightforward from our standpoint, we're big believers in the management team and the strategy and we wanted to have more exposure. But we'll leave it to them to give you an update on how the business is doing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Scott, maybe just on some of the investments that are going into Europe. When you think about sort of the backdrop there and who knows how it plays out, but if the growth is on the slower side, how do you guys think about what you want to pay in terms of the valuation currently, when you're modeling the outlook, what the economic growth assumptions are? And then if it does slow, what can the portfolio companies do to offset it, meaning there are more on the cost side, are there revenue synergies? How do you guys think about that, because there is somewhat of a level of uncertainty in the region?
Scott C. Nuttall: Look, I think it's a great question. But we have -- we started with the perspective that Europe is not a monolith, right? So you've got a variety of different views depending on the market. So we're finding the peripheries doing a bit better, Ireland and the U.K. are doing well; France, Netherlands, Italy, slightly better than they were, but still weak; Germany pulling back a bit. So you look at the underlying fundamentals of that company and the markets that they're exposed to. And then what we've done is we've created in the middle of the firm, a global macro and asset allocation group that's working with the teams, so we have a view on how each of those underlining economies may perform over the course of our investment horizon. And then, we layer onto that, that we have very long-dated capital. And so we're fortunate that we are in the long-dated option business so that we can create the option when we want and we can choose to exercise the option when we think it's appropriate. So we'll have a view as to when the markets may recover, but we have several years for that to happen. So it's really the way we look at it is to say what is the right way to capitalize this enterprise once we have a view as to that growth profile, given that underlying backdrop? And what we're doing is we're capitalizing these companies conservatively from debt -- capital structure standpoint and really making sure that we've got leverage to pull, operationally. The best run companies with the best management team in the industry and the highest margins, the returns probably aren't going to be there. So you need to have operational skills to actually invest in companies that you can make better. And so you kind of mix all that together and develop a model as to what you think can happen over the long term, and then we've got to make sure, even after you do all that, that we're compensated appropriately from a reward standpoint for the risk we're taking. And that analysis we do for private equity, but we also do it across our special situations platform, where we're creating some equity upside and a lot of the investments we're making, and even in direct lending type strategies, where we are more in the secure part of the capital structure, you have to think about the downside. And so -- I mean, that gives you bit of a sense for how we approach it, but it's very much market-based grounds up.
Operator: Thank you, that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing remarks.
Craig Larson: Thanks, again, Stephanie. And thank you, everyone, for your interest. Happy to follow-up directly with any other questions that you might have. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR’s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remark the conference will be open for question. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now hand the call over to Craig Larson Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Stephanie. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We would like to remind everyone that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. And this call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to statements. This morning, we reported second quarter economic net income of $502 million or $0.57 of ENI per unit after taxes and equity based charges. In the quarter, we were particularly active on the monetization front and are please to report record total distributable earning of $701 million, which is up 57% from last quarter and 74% from last year. On a per share basis this equates to distributable earnings net of taxes of $0.85 per unit for the quarter. This increase was driven by $333 million of net realized cash carry also record figure and in certain we’ve announced a $0.67 distribution per unit for the quarter, which is up over 50% on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Before we move on, I would like to highlight the modified disclosure in our press release. In this quarter, we changed our segment financial and Bill is going to cover how our new segment financials aligned with the metrics that we used to manage the firm. But at a high level, we’ve shifted the build to total segment revenues and total segment expenses to emphasize our three forms of revenue that’s fees, carry and balance sheet income and our two types of expenses compensation and other operating expenses. There are four main changes, first, we made our total segment revenue and expense line items all inclusive this is true for page six which is the total segment summary as well as the individual segment P&L’s which follow on pages seven, eight, and nine. Total segment revenues now include fees, carry, and balance sheet income and total segment expenses now include the allocation of the carry pool. Second investment income, so the income from the balance sheet is no longer attributable to only our third segment and instead we’ll spend each segment based on the source of the income generating. Third and this is important we’ve added a new measure fee and yield earning on the front of the press release and with further detail on page 6. This item highlights the portion of our earnings that we think should be more recurring in nature including fee-related earning plus more recurring net interest and dividend income from the balance sheet. And finally, after tax ENI per unit includes non-cash compensation charges at the total segment level. And with that I’m now happy to turn over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Before I review our results, I want to explain our thinking behind reporting changes that Craig just mentioned. Internally, we have focused on cash flow. We use total distributable earnings and distributions per unit to measure our performance as a firm. And the KFN transaction made us rethink the way we want to communicate our financial results.
.: In addition to total distributable earnings, we care about investment performance, which is important across of all of our businesses. And investment performance leads to ENI. We believe that today’s ENI is tomorrow’s distribution. And both of these metrics impact our profitability, which we measured through ROE and cash ROE. And when we evaluate our performance we consider both metrics. So, with that, let’s turn to results. As of June 30th, our assets under management were $98 billion and fee paying assets under management were $80 billion. Both figures were down quarter-over-quarter, mostly from the KFN transaction as well as modernizations in our portfolio. However, those figures are up 17% year-over-year with that growth coming both from organic and inorganic activity through the capital we raised organically and inorganically through the Avoca acquisition. Keep in mind; these figures do not reflect over $5 billion of committed capital that will be included in AUM once it is invested. This capital comes from a number of different accounts, including two new carry paying special mandates that closed in the quarter accounting for $1 billion of that $5 billion. Turning to our segments, in private market, our private equity portfolio appreciated 5% in the second quarter, up slightly from the 4.5% appreciation we had in Q1. This caused an increase in accrued carry quarter-over-quarter, but was offset by lower investment income. In the second quarter, our private market balance sheet investments were up only 2%, compared to 5% last quarter. Together, this translated into $376 million of ENI. Moving to public markets, ENI in this segment was $106 million, up 8% from last quarter. A few things contributed to the quarterly movement in ENI. As I mentioned, when KFN closed back in April, our fee paying AUM decreased more than $2 billion, which caused a decline in management fees and potential incentive fees. However, these fees really just moved geographies in the second quarter and our now part of KFN’s investment income, which we are now reporting in our P&L since the transaction closed. As a result of the KFN transaction, our public markets investment income is up significantly in the second quarter and includes $34 million of net interest and dividend income. This is also our first full quarter with both are running through our financials and the bump in management fees in that business helped to partially offset the impact of the reduction in KFN’s management team. To give you a sense of the impact that KFN had on our second quarter ENI, we generated total investment income across all our segments of $162 million, of which $56 million was generated by KFN for the two months that it contributed to our results. Touching on capital markets, we’ve reported second quarter ENI of $20 million, down from $47 million in the first quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower capital market fees in the second quarter. We have reported June 30 book value of $12.52 per unit, which is up 30% on a year-over-year basis and taken into account the impact of the KFN transaction and changing in the carried values of our balance sheet asset. Keep in mind, during the last year we also made distribution with our balance GP unitholders totaling $1.56. In the second quarter, we also did a $500 million 30-year senior note offering that we priced last month with a coupon of $508 million. Our distribution in the second quarter will be $0.67 per unit, which includes 15 of fee and yield earnings, five of which came from KFN. Remember this $0.05 represents only two months of results since KFN closed on April 30. The other two pieces is $0.67 where $0.31 of realized carry and $0.11 of realized balance sheet gain. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on one other point. We’ve made great progress over the last couple of quarters on a percentage of our assets in position to take cash carry. And as of today, all of our mature private equity funds are in position to take cash carry on a meaningful realization event. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. I’m going to hit three topics today: realization, capital deployment and our business model. Let’s start with realization. We continue to monetize our private equity portfolio in the second quarter, returning our $4 billion of cash for fund investment for mixed strategic sales, secondary and dividend. We exited Avincis and Oriental Brewery at 2x and 5x our cost respectively, and the secondary that HCA and NXP in the second quarter were down at 3.3x blended multiple of investment capital. We also completed dividend recap, the Capital Safety and Go Daddy. Additionally, the pickup in strategic exit activity continues. Since the start of the second quarter, we agreed to sell two businesses as the strategic buyers, Biomet to Zimmer, and Wild Flavors to Archer Daniels Midland. We also agreed to sell stake in Visma, our software services business in Europe. These announcements combined with the pending sales of U.S. Foods, another strategic exit and Ipreo, which resigns Blackstone and Goldman Sachs, will provide a solid foundation for cash carry in the second half. Now let me hit on capital deployment. We maintained our active investment pace in the second quarter in private market, putting $1.5 million of equity to work. This $1.5 billion includes our first investment in South America and Africa, and we believe we’ll find more investment opportunities on these two continents, as we continue to expand our global footprint. We’ve also committed another $2.5 billion of equity to deals that have been announced, but not yet closed, of which approximately 60% will be put to work outside the U.S. We’ve also been busy in public markets. If you look at the gross assets invested across all of our accounts in investments, direct lending and special situations, we deployed $1.8 billion in the first half of the year. These opportunities have been diversified by type and geography, and we’ve been particularly active in Europe where we continue to find some very interesting risk-reward opportunities. And more importantly, these strategies continue to perform. To give you a sense, our special situations, mezzanine and direct lending funds had gross returns of 41%, 24% and 15% over the last 12 months. Overall we continue to find opportunities to both buy and sell across Asia, Europe and North America. And as of June 30, we’ve distributed over $6 billion of cash to our fund investors or 1.5 times the $4 billion that we’ve invested in private markets. The last topic I want to spend time on is our business model. As we’ve explained before we believe our business model is unique. We are focused on marrying third-party capital with our balance sheet and capital markets capabilities to grow our cash flow per share. We believe the combination of the three elements of our business model is quite powerful. Our goal is to double our cash flow by capturing maximum economics from the opportunities we see and the returns we generate. It is not that we don’t care about raising third party capital, we do. It is not that we don’t care about AUM or fee related earnings, we do. We just believe that those two metrics tell only part of our story. And, looking at them in isolation can be misleading. Our model is quite different and that over 50% of our profits over the last 12 months have come from our balance sheet and our capital markets business. Neither of which contributes to AUM. We believe having our own capital invested in everything we do. And, marrying it with third-party AUM, plus capital markets, allowed us to increase alignment with our fund investors and drive a highly attractive ROE, and a larger quantum of total cash flow. Ultimately, we believe that if we use all three aspects of our models to drive our cash flow per share higher and keep a high return on equity, all of us will benefit as shareholders as we will grow our distribution and our book value. We view the task as a simultaneous equation and are working to double our cash flow while keeping our ROE above 20% and limiting leverage and dilution. In effect our business model allows us to make more money from work we are already doing in the firm. We believe this approach has inherently less execution risk. As we are increasing our participation rate in the underlying value our teams are already creating. So that’s how we think about our model at a high level, now let me drill down on some of the finer points. First, on the balance sheet our balance sheet generating significant cash flow approximately $800 million over the last 12 months. This cash flow is becoming increasing predictable. Despite building of our balance sheet investment generating a current return that we are including in our dividend. As a result our overall cash flow is growing and has a more recurring base, but it’s not just about the balance sheet. We also have compelling growth opportunities, we have eight businesses moving from fund one to fund two. And this dynamics will allow us to see significantly greater profitability in the new businesses that we’ve created over the last three to five years. I said simply, the expenses are already here to the incremental revenues or high margin. Finally, our cash carry is starting to increase rapidly, our year-to-date cash carry was more than double last years figure. I want to turn to how our business model actually works in practice and give you two recent examples. KFN and First Data, when we close the acquisition of KFN at the end of April we traded fee-paying AUM and fee related earnings for a bigger balance sheet and more recurring balance sheet income. With more permanent capital inside the firm we are better aligned with our fund investors can accelerate our growth and generate more total distributable earnings and therefore, more distributions from everything that we do. We also announced the large capital rates for First Data a few weeks down. We had a $3.5 billion private placement for the company. We invested $500 million from the 2006 fund, and $700 million from our balance sheet and our capital markets business was the store manager of the capital rates. First day amendment and the capital markets team plays $1.8 billion of equity with new third-party investors, including mutual fund, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds, the transaction closed earlier this month. First day is a good example of using our entire business model, third-party funds, our balance sheet and our capital markets business to generate more upside for a firm and our fund investors and more cash flow for all of us. It is this combination of implementing our business model, gaining our newer businesses and monetizing cash carry. It’s driving our distribution of over 60% in the first half and while we have a return on equity of 29% and a cash return on equity of 22% for the last 12 months with no net leverage. Stepping back, we have a strong pipeline of exit activity on the horizon. We had eight new businesses transitioning from Fund I to fund II, and the multiplied effect of our business model is starting to show up in our cash flow metrics. When we look at the first six months, our total distributable earnings are up 65% year-over-year. The more recurring part of our distribution is up over 50% year-over-year, and our year-to-date distribution of $1.10 is up 60%. In summary, we’re pleased with the first half results, but there’s a lot more to come in 2014. Thanks for joining our call. Operator, please open the lines. And Stephanie, if you could, I’d like to ask everyone to please focus on only one question, so we can get through the queue, and then we answer the queue if you would like to follow up on any thing additional. And with that Stephanie will take for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Kim with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Michael S. Kim – Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP: Hey, guys. Good morning. So my question, as you continue to build up the franchise, can you talk about how you approach sort of the build versus buy decision, and then related to that, when might it make sense to acquire firms like Avoca, or Prisma versus may be forming partnerships with others like BlackGold and Riverstone?
Scott C. Nuttall: Great. hey, Michael, it’s Scott. Thanks for the question. I think that everything that we’re looking at, we do now analyze what makes persons to build it or buy it. As you know, historically, before a couple of years ago, we really did very much to the build, and really everything we have done before Prisma, we have decided to build organically. What we found though is that there are some parts of the world, frankly, where an acquisition may be a more viable way to go, to get us to scale faster. Some business is frankly where we’ll be able to add talent at more scale quickly through an acquisition approach. So we really now would fair low-pass these efforts and analyze buying and building quite proactively, we create the corporate development group inside the firm, we did not have that a few years ago. So we have a dedicated team helping the business leaders to do this calculus. In terms of Avoca and Prisma versus BlackGold just to shed some light on that part of your question. Really, the question is does it make sense for it to be strategically a 100% part of the firm. With Avoca and Prisma, we decided that it did make sense to bring them in strategically on a 100% basis versus BlackGold which is really a hedge funds stake, where we actually felt it made more sense that the owners of BlackGold to continue on the vast majority of that business. And really in that instance with Prisma in the first instance we felt that it was an important cornerstone to the hedge funds strategy that we wanted to build. We felt that we could build up this dilutions part of their business, but leveraging the Prisma capabilities we felt that we could built a broader stakes and seeding business using our balance sheet capital because we like the cash-on-cash returns. And it made sense to have the Prisma team as part of KKR in total to be able to affect that overall strategy. BlackGold is an example of one of those hedge funds stakes that we took as part of that strategy. Avoca similarly, we had been building out our credit business globally, as you know we had business in the U.S. at the time that had private and public credit working side by side. In Europe we only had private credit Avoca products to the public part and made sense to make a more holistically part of the firm. So that’s how we think about it and we will continue to access those path.
Michael S. Kim – Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP: Okay, thanks for taking…
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Carrier – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys. So maybe just on the modeling, when we think about the distribution, yes I think when you lose management fees and then goes to investment income. One of those things that sometimes you feel differently, but when you think of the mix now of your distributable earnings, is there a way to characterize like what portion of it you would say. I know you hit on it in terms of that’s more recurring, but is there a certain portion of the asset that have fairly consistent yields, just trying to get some understating on what can we start to think of is more kind of ongoing versus it’s going to ebb and flow with the market.
William J. Janetschek: Sure. I think Michael, we think about it. If you look at page six of the press release you see you now have this new metric fee and yield earnings. And really what was capturing there is the historical definition of fee related earnings I don’t think people had though of historically as more recurring in nature, but we are now starting to include this net interest and dividends component of the balance sheet. That’s the more recurring net interest and dividend that we get off our balance sheet. And about $5 billion of our balance sheet assets now are generating or we think it’s a more recurring dividend or yield and so that’s one metric that you can look to, they try to get a feel for that. So you can see in the first six months and this is obviously without having KFN for the whole period only had it in for two months. You can see what that number look like that the $317 million that was show on page six. But the other page that I pointed to is page 15, which is the distribution calculation itself. And if you look at that page you can see the last box line, on that page we actually show fee and yield earnings per unit. And you can see that in the first six months was about $0.31. I’d expect that would continue to increase now that KFN is part of the fold completely and is that rolls in the numbers for the back half. You see that – I think that number will continue to grow on an apples-to-apples basis. But the other thing that pointing on that page is what KFN into our payout ratio. So you can see last year Q2 is 76%, is now somewhere between 78% and 79% as we’ve changed our distribution policy to payout all of those earnings. So the point that we are trying to make though is while if you look at the numbers, its $0.31 in the first half out of a $10 of distribution. I think it would be the wrong thing, to do say that carry and balance sheet income otherwise are not recurring. We’ve paid cash carry in each of the last 17 quarters and as you know we know the vast, vast majority virtually all of our private equity funds paying cash carry. So all though it’s harder to predict specifically quarter-to-quarter, it’s actually been quite recurring in nature and given that we’re – our own biggest investor, when we have cash carry events, it generates balance sheet realization events as well which also contributes through the dividend. So, I can’t view it as the spectrum and we have a lot of recurring income and we are excited it’s scaling so significantly as you know that dividend was up 60% in the first half.
Scott C. Nuttall: And Michael, just one follow-up when you thinking about the question at hand is the more recurring nature of that income. Keep in mind that KKR’s balance sheet traditionally was heavy into private equity. Now, private equity only makes up 40% of that balance sheet. As we diversify that you are going to see more recurring income come from the KKR part of the balance sheet those share repurchase page 15, and that $0.15 is really $0.09 of fee related earnings plus the nickel from cap end, but it’s only $0.01 from KKR. But again as that portfolio continues to diversify, we will see more recurring interest and dividends come from that balance sheet and hopefully that number will go up.
Michael Carrier – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Will Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.
William R. Katz – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay, thanks so much appreciate taking the questions. Scott you mentioned that you have eight different funds that could move from first to sort of second vintages, if you will. Can you walk through where you see the greatest opportunity will it be private markets, public markets, US, non-US, so give a sense of what investors are looking for right now?
Scott C. Nuttall: Absolutely, Bill. Thanks for the question, look I think before I answer, I would say the overall funding raising backdrop is quite positive. We’re seeing institutional investors get more cash back, frankly from their alternatives, portfolios and they we’re expecting for us and others. At the same time is over the last few years, they have actually increased their allocation to alternatives. So they are looking to put capital to work, so the fact that we are raising money probably second time funds is actually quite positive for us, we think we got the timing right. So, that’s good a backdrop and to answer your question. I think it’s pretty broad based. In terms of the different strategies where we are active from a fund one to fund two, we are out with infrastructure two right now. Our infrastructure one fund has performed quite nicely, direct lending two is in the market. Frankly, we are virtually fully invested on our first special SITS fund. So we are going to be launching special SITS 2 as we mentioned in the remarks. Last 12 months returned in our special SITS strategy, we are over 40% gross. So we are optimistic about that fund raise over time as well and there is a variety of other things on the private capital side, European direct lending. So, that a lot of what I mentioned that putting the more episodic both kind of real assets and originated credit buckets. So there is a significant amount of activity with a good back drop there. But also frankly we are seeing opportunities to scale in the hedge fund and credit side of the business is a more continuously raised vehicles as well Prisma, the two credit funds that we have is part of the credit business, the Stakes, Nephila, BlackGold et cetera. And then in the credit side, we are raising CLOs, PCT continues to scale, so I would say there is a pretty broad based opportunity to continue to scale our capital, and I do remiss it’s not a fund to, but you have four strategies also in the market, it’s a bit early but so far so good.
William R. Katz – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Patrick Davitt – Autonomous Research US LP: Good morning, guys. There was recent report on NPL sales in Europe up 6x year-over-year and since that you’re really starting to see banks kind of fixed about – curios, if you’re seeing the same thin and to what extent, you can still get good deals in that kind of environment with the amount of capital that has already been raised for this kind of stuff, both from you and your competitors?
Scott C. Nuttall: Good morning, Patrick. I think we are seeing more activity in terms of what banks are selling. Probably a year ago, there was a lot of noise, but the beta spread was frankly quite wide. And you’re right there has been more actual activity – why those portfolios are frankly reasonably well did. so while we have bought a few and those have touched, or performed quite well. We’re not spending the bulk of our time there. We’re really finding more interesting opportunity and it’s particularly, the case across Europe and especially on the continent is the derivative fact, the fact that the banks are internally focused and/or not customer focused right now. And so what we’re finding is that there’s a number of good companies that have capital structures that are maturing that need help. And so a lot of our activity is providing rescue capital for financing for those companies that’s really a consequence of the fact that the banks are going through, what they’re going through. So it’s created an opportunity for us, as a result of the regulatory environment and the fact those banks are quite levered. And so that’s the primary opportunity buying portfolios has been a secondary opportunity. Having said that, we are in discussions with a number of banks about helping them, worked the way out of some existing assets in creating partnerships to do that, it’s hard to predict how that will play out. But the most activity today is actually, it is working directly with corporates.
Patrick Davitt – Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery with Sanford. Your line is open.
Luke Montgomery – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. thanks, guys. I was hoping you might clarify your relationship with Capstone. I guess the key question here is whether or not, they might be deemed in affiliate, and it’s I guess unclear to me whether this hinges on the technical use in definition of that term in your fund documents, or whether it’s more about the economic relationship you had with them. so I was hoping maybe, you could touch on both of those aspects, and on the latter, clarify whether Capstone executives share any one of your revenue pools. And you think the fact that they’re captive and appeared to be at least partially controlled by a KKR has any bearing on whether they might be considered in affiliates somewhere down the road, is that term is generally or legally accepted to mean?
William J. Janetschek: Okay. this is Bill Janetschek. At its core, the Capstone is not an affiliate. Capstone is a consulting firm that provides services to KKR portfolio of companies. When you talk about economics, the fee income that they receive is as fair as they provide, or pay to all of the KKR executives and all of the Capstone…
Luke Montgomery – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Capstone.
William J. Janetschek: All of those Capstone executives, sorry. In all of the supplement, the economics for those KKR – those Capstone executives, they’re not KKR. The carry pool that we have which is catered throughout KKR. A portion of that is actually allocated to Capstone executives that comes from KKR economics and not from our fund economics.
Scott C. Nuttall: And Luke, it’s Scott. I’d just add really simply, you are asking on legal analysis question, the punch line is KKR owns no equity in Capstone, legal analysis is not an affiliate. We’ve been open about that with our investors from the get go is actually in the limited partnership agreement as to how the relationship works. So we don’t think the people that we work for have any confusion on that topic.
Luke Montgomery – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, that makes sense to me, and it seems like you think the risk there is fairly low just a worst case scenario maybe you criticize the potential impact on unit holders and what are the fees that you are paying away to Capstone executives?
Scott C. Nuttall: I just did understand the construct today the portfolio companies pay Capstone directly. So the bottom line is do we not expect there to be any impact on KKR, it’s actually not in our financial segments.
William J. Janetschek: Right, to be clear none of this segment results that we provide have any Capstone economics running through it. Those fees have to be paid by the portfolio companies to Capstone and do not show up in our results.
Luke Montgomery – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right, somebody has to pay Capstone as is the GPs or the LPs, so I’m just wondering it’s determinant that the GPs are on the hook for then what is the potential size of that for some relevant period.
William J. Janetschek: The GPs and the LPs are not paying Capstone, the portfolio companies are paying Capstone.
Luke Montgomery – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, I’ll follow-up with you guys. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell – Deutsche Bank AG: Great, good morning guys. You’ve talked a little bit about the growth in fee paying assets under management from here, maybe if you can just, when you think some of that $5 billion of committed capital can move into fee paying AUM and whether the new fund raises on Fund II whether you think that will be roughly inline with the – on Fund I. And just some color maybe start on, you talked about the U.S. versus non-U.S deployment, the non-U.S. deployment is increasing. If you can talk about maybe your footprint international in and over the long-term, opportunity is longer term being much more oriented outside the U.S.?
William J. Janetschek: Great. So I think in terms of handling those in turn. In practice, Fund I are – take longer to raise and historically they’ve been kind of a $1 billion, $1.5 billion or so in size. Because obviously the first time fund you kind of telling more stories and showing actual results and when you get the Fund II if you have investment performance that is actually an ability to scale the assets under management quite materially. So, I guess given that we’ve the investment performance; our general expectations will be that the Fund II for each of these strategies, those Fund II would be larger than Fund I. In some cases I would expect them to be a multiple of the size of Fund I. So that’s one of reasons for – about that opportunity. But the other more important element as the economics and how that flows through our financial results. Because in Fund I it finished investing and Fund II turns on, we still collect a post investment period management fee on Fund I. So you’ve got the Fund II new management fees turn on, Fund I is still paying the trailer, usually had a reduced rate. And about this time Fund II turns on is about the time that Fund I carry starts to show up with the economic associated from this Fund I to Fund II move as we mentioned a quite significant given the expenses are already here. In terms of the shadow question that’s really going to depend by strategy I think it’s a general matter we’d expect that to come into the actual fee thing of AUM over the next two to three years depending on the strategy. and in terms of our footprint, we now have 21 offices around the world, and a vast majority of those were outside United States. if you look at the deployment year-to-date about 60% plus of it has been outside the U.S. and we’ve been particularly active in Asia so far this year, where we’d count a lot of opportunity resulting from the dislocation. But frankly, we’re seeing opportunities in real estate, that’s a situation infrastructure across Asia and Europe. So I’d say we’re well positioned, I mentioned Africa and South America, it really has become a very global opportunity stuff, and we think we’re quite well positioned to capture.
Brian Bedell – Deutsche Bank AG: And it sounds like based on the stuff – what you talked was direct lending in Europe, and your proportion of deployment with that 60% number could actually go up over the next couple of different valuations with U.S. Is that fair?
William J. Janetschek: It very well could and it’s impossible to predict, because it’s a lot of delay. But we still see some value in the U.S., but valuations are obviously. And so it’s getting harder to find value, we’ve had more success of late finding value in Asia and some of the other emerging markets.
Brian Bedell – Deutsche Bank AG: Great. thanks for taking my question.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning. I’m circling back between pages of 11 and 14 in the press release. And I wonder if you could flesh out a little bit what’s happening in the real assets business. You mentioned that you thought infrastructure was doing well, your infrastructure fund did real well, and that your raising fund too. But if you just look at where it’s market fair value, relative to costs, both real estate and infrastructure, it looks like they’re all marked reasonably closed to cars. So is that because it’s a yield vehicle, or because they were dividend recaps, or what…?
William J. Janetschek:
 : When you’re talking about real estate, we’ve got a value right now of $400 million against a cost of $360 million, but we’ve already returned $129 million. So that real estate fund has a multiple of 1.5x, our money and keep in mind that that fund has only gone miles over the past year.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great.
William J. Janetschek: An information on real estate, again, there is a yield component to real estate, but there is also a significant amount of appreciation in the real estate portfolio so far.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Right, okay. But actually, I was wondering about that, what it chose is the total invested is $360.8 million and the remaining cost $360.4 million, but $129 has been realized. So that, does that you’ve realized $129 million on $400,000 of cost basis? Can’t be, right?
William J. Janetschek: What happens is, for you to just get a little technical there is recycling provision in real estate. And so we have to return the cost and so that’s why that number maybe looks a little…
Scott C. Nuttall: When we have early exits, Chris, wherever they use the capital again.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then what I’m looking at Page 11, I look at the real estate, it’s only marked up 5% above cost, it seems like that should theoretically be more?
William J. Janetschek: Well it is up, but remember this is only showing the costs and the fair value, it is not capturing any of the distributions, so my point back…
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Gotcha, okay.
William J. Janetschek: Page 14 is the 360 to 402 is up only a little, but not shown on the balance sheet again is all the distributions that have been made today.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it, great. Okay, thank you.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I think look we had an early big win on Sunrise which we sold for over five times our cost, within 16 months. So what’s happening is that, capital is getting recycled the gain doesn’t show up, it’s already in the cash sitting on the balance sheet that’s maybe helps you.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes, and actually I meant to ask about the cash on the balance sheet, the way when we look at page I think it was 10 of the new balance sheet. The way to look at your net cash position now is the 3,375 minus the 1.05 billion of KKR debt obligations, right. So, in your view you have a 1.875 on the balance sheet in cash right?
William J. Janetschek: Correct. And then remember keep in mind Chris that, we’ve got that $3.4 billion in cash right now on a balance sheet we have mentioned that we are investing $700 million in First Data of our balance sheet and when you take into account, the $0.67 that we are going to be paying out in this quarterly distribution, that amounts due in access of $500 million, so cash is already find a home for $1.2 million of that $3.4 billion.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Craig Larson: This is Craig. One other point to just highlight, and again we’re actually hesitating to give statistics like this just recognizing that on a Sun like real estate we think we are actually its an immature fund. And we remain in a pretty early stage in terms of the investment dynamics in that fund, but if you look at the IRR on real estate today, it’s a number that exceeds 60%. So again in terms of performance of the real estate fund, we’re actually very excited about the start that we have and again using Sunrise as an example of a modernization that we had very early in the life cycle of that the ability to recycle it. So that there from a performance stand point again it’s off to a great start.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay great. Thank you, that’s it from me.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Oh, great, thanks. Scott can you talk about the percentage committed by the general party and I guess on page 14 you show your general partner co-invest by fund. I think you have a $1 billion in the release disclosed $976.9 million in the uncalled commitments. But on some of the newer funds the percentage that you’ll commit side by side to those newer funds are bigger and I guess as you get to later in the fund raising stages for the – for some of the newer funds. Can you give us a sense of just going forward, how should we think about the percentage that you commit side by side to particular funds versus using your own balance sheet capital to you know to opportunistically deploy side by side with investors?
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Marc. What I think we are going continued to do both. The way we do really look at it is back to this ROE concept and total cash flow and what we were focused on doing is keeping the ROE at a very attractive level and keeping our cash flow per share high and growing it. So what we’ll do is, we’ll actually look at the underlined investment opportunity and we’ll figure out how much capital we want to exposed to the strategy in the funds and a lot of instances frankly like we did with real estate, we find that if we’re speaking for more of our own dollars it makes the fund raising process faster and allows us to scale third party capital more quickly. And so we’ll go through that calculus, but really what we’ll do – if it’s a strategy where we think we can generate let’s say a 15% or 20% return. We review that is the first component to the return stream. So actual dollars we have invested in that strategy that’s the first piece of it. Then we’ll look at it and say all right, we can get fees in carry back on top of that and this capital markets opportunities again on top of that. And so, really if you look at our business model, what we found is that, if we can generate 15% plus on the balance sheet investments themselves, and we get another 1500 basis points of ROE from fee and carry that’s how you get to the ROEs that we’ve generated with no net leverage. So we are in the fund business, we’ll continue to have our percentage invested as GP. As you can see is kind of range between the very small percentages to much higher. But we also like that, keep some capital free for more opportunistic situations where there might be larger deals that we want to lean into. But what we do find is because the funds go first in the waterfall; we absolutely want to have our capital in those funds, so we participate as our own largest investor. So I wouldn’t think about it as a percent, especially going from Fund I to Fund II, you can actually have a fund go from a $1 billion to $2 billion or $3 billion. So I think the percentage is not the right way to think about it. I would just think about it in terms of the aggregate dollars we want to expose to different asset classes. And if you think about our balance sheet over time the reason we show this discloser is that’s how we look at it internally, is how much do we want in real assets versus private equity versus credit versus hedge funds. And so we’ll continue to report on that basis and then over time focus on making sure the ROE is 20% plus in each of those.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Devin Ryan – JMP Securities: Hey, good morning. Just a question on the current finance market, there is clearly been discussion in recent months just around the increasing regulatory scrutiny on banks that are providing financing on some of the more lever deals. And it doesn’t seem to be impacting the market of financing terms significantly at this point, but I guess it’s two part question. As the dialogue with banks changed it all in recent months related to this. And then secondly, are you seeing any maybe opportunities just to remediate the banks where you create funds that are maybe focused on the financing strategy here, just your thoughts there would be helpful.
Scott C. Nuttall: Happy to take that Devin, it’s Scott. I think couple of thoughts. When you write it hasn’t impacted our ability to get deals done to date. There is clearly more dialogue on the topic now then there would have been over the course of the last couple of quarters, so it’s clearly more top of minds for banks. What we found though is, we are testing a broader net in an environment like this. Our capital markets business is a huge advantage for us. Because there is opportunities for us given that we’ve direct relationships with the number of institutions around the world, some of which frankly are not subject to these potential limitation. So we’ve been able to get transactions done by discussing that broader net and using our capital markets team to do so. But it also does create an opportunity for us and the private credit part of our business. I mentioned our direct lending business, that’s an example, our mezzanine business, the private credit markets will step in if there is a meaningful change in the behavior. So our perspective is we are well positioned through capital markets, so it still gets deals done in the private equity side. And our private credit business should benefit if these set guidelines getting here to, once the people figure out about all rules actually mean in practice.
Devin Ryan – JMP Securities: Got it. Helpful. Would your private credit business deals that you are doing as well as it or does that create a conflict of interest potentially?
Scott C. Nuttall: No, it does with the private credit business; we’re looking at KKR deals. There’s limitations as to the percentage of KKR deals that can be in individual vehicles. We obviously have evolved and compliance procedures in place. But there is an opportunity for those teams to look at those transactions if they like the risk reward. The vast bulk of our business is not financing KKR deals.
Devin Ryan – JMP Securities: Great thanks, helpful color.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Christopher Harris – Wells Fargo: Hey guys, just a real quick numbers question for you and I apologize if I missed it. But it sounds like the second half of the year shaping up pretty nicely from an exit perspective, sounds like you guys had a few things in a pipeline. Any guidance you guys you can give us around you know potential cash carry could be looking at it some of the things that are kind of in process.
William J. Janetschek: This is Bill. The only thing I could give you is a little color on third quarter and based upon the transactions we’ve announced and not yet closed. But we expect to close in the third quarter and that would be IPO and Prisma and we also actually had a secondary done it’s actually (indiscernible) and Jazz. Right now the cash carry number to the third quarter is $0.14 and a balance sheet number is $0.08, so that’s $0.22 so far where we are today, based upon expected closing and obviously that takes in, does not take into account any earnings from fee income or any earnings from KFN.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I’d say just more broadly on the topic and – there is a lot of embedded value in the portfolios, as you think about our ability to generate cash carry going forward and as a reminder 12, 15 months ago we had about 35% of our private equity funds paying cash carry. Now its virtually 100% and so if you look at the make up of the unrealized value in that private equity portfolio that’s now paying cash carry, we have over $20 billion of its market one and a half times or greater and about 45% of it – of the unrealized value is from 2008 and prior vintages. And so obviously these companies are getting more mature, its part of the reason you’ve see our cash carry increase so significantly. But the good news is that there is plenty left to go.
Christopher Harris – Wells Fargo: Helpful. Thank you
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is open.
M. Patrick Davitt – Autonomous Research LLP: Hey, guys, from the idea of around KFN rolling into higher yielding assets and strategies. Can you, maybe help us with the framework for thinking about the timeline for that happening as it is easier looking at the maturities of your CLOs and assuming those role into some of the more (indiscernible) remediation type stuff that you are doing or is that – is it just too hard to even try to think about that way.
Scott C. Nuttall: Patrick, it is Scott. I would – its hard to be precise, because it’s going to depend on a couple of things, one is how that portfolio rolls off to your point which is probably easier to model. If you also look the opportunity set in the market that we see where we can deploy more balance sheet capital against it. And some of that runs to Marc’s question about how much capital we have committed to our funds because we think about sizing our fund commitment to higher returning strategies, we’re thinking about how we use that KFN roll off to be able to do that. But just a dimensional has it for you I mean there are extremes, we mentioned when we announced the KFN transaction at the return on capital there was a bit about 10% we are run rating there or frankly a little bit better that so far. So far so good, but as you heard just even our originated credit strategy is the returns to generating and those strategies are between 15% and 40%. And so it’s hard to get specific. But I’d say we are sitting here today not long after the KFN close still quite confident what we shared with you that we believe we can redeploy that capital as materially better returns and the 10% to 11%, it was generating before. And what we’re going to keep an eye on is making sure that we continue to generate an attractive yield of the balance sheet as we focus on that fee and yield EBITDA, and continue to drive up the much more predictable aspect of our dividends. So it’s going to be a combination of all of those factors that we’ll go into it, very difficult to give your modeling guidance however.
M. Patrick Davitt – Autonomous Research LLP: Okay. and just little quickly, it struck me that you said around the First Data transaction that you have indicated $1.8 billion, which is really a pretty big number relative to what you’ve been doing last six months. Does that portend a massive capital markets fee, or is that not the right way to think about?
William J. Janetschek: No, I think in terms of the First Data deals, just to break down the numbers. There I mentioned it was $3.5 billion capital raise. Recall that we, KKR spoke for $1.2 billion [Technical Difficulty]. so there was a total of $2.3 billion raised from third parties, $500 million of that $2.3 billion was raised from existing investments in first [Technical Difficulty] we’re not going to get a capital market beyond that. the $1.8 billion that will generate a capital markets fee in the third quarter. Actually First Data publically disclosed what that number would be; it’s a bit over $40 million from that transaction for our capital markets business in Q3.
M. Patrick Davitt – Autonomous Research LLP: Awesome, all right. Thank you so much.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dina Shin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Dina Shin – Credit Suisse Securities LLC:
 :
 :
 :
William J. Janetschek: This is Bill, if you refer to page 14, you can see that you are right, real assets right now, we’ve got committed capital of $7 billion plus in those strategies, as well as on the public market side approximately in other $7 billion. All of those are like private equity, like terms where we have the ability to receive carry. Each investment has been made over the past couple of years and the good news is in that most of the strategies, we are approving carry and running that through our P&Ls vis-à-vis ENI. but we haven’t had significant crystallizations in any of those mandates, and have been paid out much cash carry. I do want to point out that in the first quarter of 2014, we did other realization event in one of the mandates that we have on the public markets side where we had gross carry of $25 million. And as you continue to see the performance developed in those strategies, we will continue to pay; we have the ability to pay cash carry. I also want to reference page 10 and you could see that right now on our balance sheet, in public markets alone, we have about $78 million of carry that has been approved in that portfolio of $7 billion that we’re managing and that’s ENI and that hasn’t turned into cash carry as again.
Scott C. Nuttall: I think with respect to the second part of the question, nothing that in particular that we’ve been pointed to that we’re not going to break down the individual’s main performance on the balance sheet. but I’d just point in the first half of balance sheet of 8% over the last 12 months of balance sheet was up about 22%, so it continues to perform quiet nicely.
Dina Shin – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Thank you.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes, I guess just a follow-up on the opportunity in Europe. I mean I guess, I think it’s a funny situation right in that economic malaise there has been longer and harder than anybody would have thought a couple of years ago. And so that’s led your Europe II and Europe III returns to be fairly low, relative to your other fronts. but you can see the net IRRs are trending up now, and that’s nicely. but at the same time, Europe is kind of probably one of the world’s best investment opportunities or certainly one of the more distressed and dislocated ones. And at the same time, kind of your views, most of the funds are uncalled commitments in front three. So I guess what is that – what is your strategy for raising a new fund in Europe before Europe II and III really fully have the kind of returns that you’d like to show to raise some new fund.
William J. Janetschek: That’s good Chris, I’d give – just give a couple of perspectives. You’re right. I mean Europe III is up 33% in the last 12 months. and frankly, the markets are strong, creating some attractive exits for us, strategic you’re buying. I mentioned the ADM purchase of our flavors business. So we’re returning a lot of cash royalties. and so liquidity is good. And so really what happened is that as you point out, Europe III is now fully invested, or certainly passed its investment period. So the deals that we’ve been doing frankly, we’re now doing on the balance sheet pending a first close of Europe IV. We launched the fund rates for Europe IV in February, March, thereafter we had year-end numbers. And I say as a general matter, there’s quite a bit of optimism about the – an investment opportunity in Europe, whereas 12 months ago, kind of fear range, we’ve kind of just gone from fear degree, as it relates to the European investment opportunities. So the fundraising backdrop is much better than it’s been. So what we’re doing is we’re continuing to be active. we’re actually adding talent in Europe. we opened a Madrid office earlier this year. And Europe is not a moderate. All right, so UK and Ireland are doing well. France, Netherlands, Italy are better good still, but weak. we are finding investment opportunities in private equity, although evaluations were watching very carefully, but we’re also finding opportunities in real estate and in special situations, which I mentioned previously. So we do like the investment opportunity, the liquid markets have lowered back; the private and liquid markets are still yielding some very attractive opportunities for us. So the way we’re handling it from a capital standpoint is continuing to deploy, using our balance sheet in the intervening periods to fill the gap on private equity opportunities, and then we’ll drop some of those funded deals down into EIV when it has its first closing, which we expect will be sometime late this year, or early next year.
Chris M. Kotowski – Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Warren Gardiner with Evercore. Your line is open.
Warren A. Gardiner – Evercore Partners: Yes. Thanks. Sorry if I missed this. So could you guys just give us a breakdown between private and public markets and private equity? I guess maybe the Biomet market; I just wanted to get a sense for kind of any EBITDA growth momentum there?
William J. Janetschek: Just to clarify the question. Did you want – Warren, did you want the mark, or how the underlying businesses are performing?
Warren A. Gardiner – Evercore Partners: Well, I guess both, I mean I was starting with the March, so I could get a sense, but I was assuming there maybe – it will be more EBITDA driven, maybe sort of color around those will be really helpful?
William J. Janetschek: Okay. Let me see if I can try to take a shot at it. So what we’ve seen with our private equity funds, about 24% over the course of last 12 months. And 5% or so in the quarter, if you look at what’s driving that, our private investments are actually up more than our public investments over the course of Q2. Year-to-date, privates were up a bit more than publics. And if you look at what’s contributing to that, we still see some very attractive underlying growth; call it mid single-digit revenue growth, high single-digit EBITDA growth in those businesses. So I think if you look at the market broadly, you see that the performance of the U.S. stock market last year is 70% of it, was driven by multiple expansion, this year’s 70% of the market performance is driven by EPS growth. And I’d say our underlying portfolio; we’re king of seeing its similar dynamics that there is more of an uplift that’s driven by earnings performance as opposed to multiples so far this year. In terms of the kind of public markets businesses, it’s a very different dynamic frankly. Our mezzanine business is up a lot, because we’ve had some exits, we get warrants in some of those companies. So as multiples have expanded in some of those specific opportunities we benefitted from that, to special situations returns, which are quite highs, really driven by a lot of different things, but I’d say it’s a really combination of the recovery in the European markets, plus multiple expansion, plus some quick exits and some good investment decision. So it’s very hard to be two plus size on that. But overall, I’d say the overall tone feels like most of the returns are coming from operating performance as opposed to multiple expansion this year across everything we’re doing.
Warren A. Gardiner – Evercore Partners: Okay.
Scott C. Nuttall: And I would add, Warren is, we actually go through a pretty exhausted analysis at the end of every quarter. So we look by geography in terms of the privates how they’re performing. we look at that on a consistent company basis to try and think out noise, we look at that for the quarter, we look at that LTM and again, and when you boil down that kind of high single-digit EBITDA growth is a statistic test and pretty constant for us for the last several quarters. So that’s strength of something that we’ve seen pretty consistent.
Warren A. Gardiner – Evercore Partners: Okay. Very helpful, I got it. Thanks
William J. Janetschek: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Craig Larson for closing remarks

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to KKR's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Tanya. Welcome to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. I'd like to remind everyone to begin that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. This call will also contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. So please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. On the call, we will also be providing estimates on cash carry, and its impact on future distributions. These estimates are based on March 31 valuations, as well as unit counts prior to the KFN closing. And for anything about the KFN transaction, please do refer to the proxy statement and other SEC filings that both KFN and KKR have made because they contain important information about the transaction. This morning, we reported first quarter economic net income of $630 million, which equates to $0.82 of after-tax economic net income per unit. Fee related earnings for the quarter were $152 million, which is the highest we've ever reported as a public company, representing approximately a 26% increase from last quarter, and an increase of over 70% from the same time last year. This growth was driven by higher management fee revenue across the firm, as well as strong transaction fees that were generated in our capital market segment. We do continue to be active on the realization front. So I'd like to highlight some of our cash metrics. Total distributable earnings were $447 million, which is up over 50% from the first quarter of 2013. This growth was driven both by the jump in fee related earnings I just mentioned as well as $116 million of net realized cash carry in the first quarter, which is more than double the $53 million we reported in the first quarter of last year. And on the distribution, we announced a distribution per unit of $0.43 for the quarter. If the KFN transaction closes before our record date, the distribution won't change, and it will be paid out to all record holders. Before I turn it over to Scott and Bill, as we have discussed for some time, one point I would like to highlight. We have a unique business model. Alongside, third-party capital, we have the largest balance sheet among the alternative asset management firms, which we use to support our growth, as well as to invest behind our ideas, as well as our Capital Markets business that is unlike any other in the industry. And from a financial perspective, you can perhaps best see how powerful our platform is through our cash flow focus metrics. Total distributable earnings, which again were $447 million, as well as total distributable earnings per unit and our distribution per unit, which were $0.64 and $0.43 respectively in the quarter. And finally, we were pleased to have finalized our K-1s by the end of March, thanks to the hard work of Bill and his team, for the eighth consecutive year. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Bill.
William J. Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. We ended the first quarter with assets under management of $102 billion, up 8% from last quarter and 30% from the same time last year. Distribution to our fund LPs offset investment appreciation and new capital rates, which was true for both our private and public market segments. The majority of our AUMs have been in the first quarter was due to the closing of the Avoca acquisition, which brought $8.4 billion of AUM online. As of March 31, our fee paying assets under management were $84 billion, also an increase of 8% from last quarter and 34% from last year. Similar to AUM, the addition of Avoca drove the increase in our fee paying AUM. In the first quarter, total fee revenue of $328 million was up almost 50% year-over-year, and the majority of this increase was organic, with only $5 million of fee income coming from Avoca. Fee related earnings were a record $152 million, up 25% from last quarter and over 70% from the first quarter 2013. The quarterly increase was driven by higher management transaction fees across all of our segments. Total distributable earnings were $447 million in the first quarter, up over 50% from the $291 million we reported in the first quarter of 2013. Turning to our segment results. Private Markets, our private equity portfolio appreciated 4.5% in the first quarter, outperforming the MSCI World and S&P 500, which were up 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. This was less than the 8% appreciation we had in the fourth quarter of 2013 though. So despite higher fee revenue in the first quarter, the $241 million of ENI was down from the $369 million we reported last quarter. Moving to Public Markets. ENI in this segment was $68 million, down 7% from last quarter, but up about 40% on a year-over-year basis. A few things contributed to the quarterly movement in the ENI. We saw a significant increase in management fees as we continue to scale fee paying AUM in this segment. However, this was offset by a decrease in incentive fees as the fourth quarter is a more active incentive quarter for most of our public market accounts. That said, we did have $17 million of incentive fees in the first quarter, $12 million of which came from KFN. Most importantly, our private credit strategy continues to perform. In the first quarter, our direct lending mezzanine and special chit funds posted gross returns of 4%, 6% and 11%, respectively. And as a result of this performance, our public market segments has begun to contribute to cash carry. We reported $25 million of cash carry in the quarter, and as of March 31, we have over $60 million of net unrealized carry on our balance sheet in this segment. We expect the potential for cash carry in Public Markets to increase as our carry eligible funds, which now stand at over $5 billion, continue to mature and perform. Touching on Capital Markets and principal activities. Capital Markets fee income was up 3-fold in the quarter versus last year. However, our balance sheet was up 6% this quarter compared to 7% both last quarter and last year. Because of this decrease, ENI was $321 million in the first quarter, down slightly from last quarter and last year. The increase in the carrying value of our balance sheet assets resulted in a March 31 book value of $11.18 per unit, which is up 13% on a year-over-year basis and includes a 35% increase in unrealized carry, bringing that total figure to about $1.3 billion. As Craig mentioned earlier, our distribution in the first quarter was $0.43 per unit, which is up about 60% from the same time last year. The $0.43 is comprised of $0.15 of fee related earnings, $0.17 of realized carry and $0.11 of realized balance sheet income. Before I wrap up, we want to give you a preview of the second quarter distribution based upon where we are today. Since March 31, we have announced 6 realization events that we estimate will contribute approximately $0.40 to the second quarter distribution, which includes $0.34 of proceeds that are already in the bank and another $0.06 from Avincis, which is expected to close later this quarter. $0.24 of that $0.34 came from OB, which closed in early April, and the balance will come from realization to Capital Safety, Aricent, Pets at Home and the sale of Sunrise Senior Living, which is the first exit in our real estate fund. We expect to exit our Sunrise investment in over 5x our invested capital, and with a holding period of only 16 months. Additionally, this $0.40 does not include our Ipreo or U.S. Foods, 2 other pending sales that we expect to close later in 2014. And keep in mind, these numbers reflect our current share count. And with that, I'll pass it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. We had a good start to the year. I'm going to briefly hit on 3 items: monetizations; the level of activity in Europe; and KFN. Let's start with monetizations. We've been active on the private equity exit front, returning cash to our fund investors through the Public Markets, strategic sales and dividends. In Q1, we took Pets at Home and Santander public. We also did secondary to Jazz, KION, ProSieben, NXP and Neilsen at a blended multiple of 2.4x our cost. In 2014, we continue to see a pickup in strategic exit activity. We recently agreed to sell 2 businesses, Avincis, a European helicopters services firm, at 2.3x cost, and Ipreo, a capital markets services provider, at approximately 3x cost. These combined with the strategic exits of Oriental Brewery, U.S. Foods and Sunrise Senior Living will provide a strong pipeline of cash carry in the distribution over the next 2 quarters. Year-to-date, we had over 12 realized or pending private equity monetization events out of 6 different funds across the U.S., Asia and Europe. Together, these exits generated over $5 billion in actual and expected distributions to our fund investors so far this year. And we've had additional good news this morning, as we agreed to sell Biomet. Biomet is a 2006 fund investment, and we have an additional co-investment on our balance sheet. The implied transaction value would suggest around a 40% to 45% improvement in Biomet's valuation relative to where we held it as of March 31. Now let me discuss Europe for a few minutes. We think it's a great time to be investing in Europe, as the recovery continues. First, in European private equity, we had strong results, with our portfolio up about 50% in 2012 and 25% in 2013 and off to a good start in 2014, outperforming the MSCI Europe by about 300 basis points in the first quarter. In the last several months, we've taken Pets at Home, KION and Tarkett public and the value of our remaining stake across the 3 companies is over $2 billion and marked at approximately 2x our cost. Capital deployment has also been healthy. Europe accounted for over 30% of our equity invested in Q1, and we began fund-raising for our European private equity strategy. On the alternative credit side, we've also been busy, deploying approximately $1 billion of capital in the first quarter across all of our accounts. And if you look at special situations, for example, over 40% of that capital was put to work in Europe. And finally, we closed on the Avoca acquisition in February, which brings our European credit assets from $4 billion to $12 billion and expands our European credit footprint to be more consistent with the business that we've created in the U.S. The last topic I want to spend time on is KFN. As we said in December, we expect that KFN's recurring balance sheet income will increase our distribution per unit over time and materially increase our recurring distribution per unit. Additionally, the KFN transaction will bring us more capital to grow our firm and more flexibility to pursue outsized opportunities, when we find something we like. The shareholder vote is next Wednesday, and we hope to close shortly thereafter. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter. Over the last year, we've been talking about how our business model and approach are a bit different. We're focused on monetizing our investments and ideas by marrying third-party capital, our balance sheet and our capital markets capabilities in a unique manner. As a result of this approach, we generate very attractive returns on equity, 26% in the last 12 months with no net leverage at our company. About a year ago, we changed our distribution policy to make it clear that all of us as unitholders will participate in the outcomes we generate through a high and transparent payout ratio. Our perspective is that the best way to judge our results is by looking at the cash flow we generate and the distributions we pay. And our view has been that as carry kicked in, and the balance sheet performed, our cash flow and distribution had a lot of upside. A year later, we are starting to see this come through our results. Our Q1 total distributable earnings are up over 50% and our distribution is up 60%. And on an LTM basis, our distribution is up 30% to $1.56. In short, the model is starting to yield the results that we envisioned. And with the addition of KFN, Avoca and the increase in exit activity, plus the evolution of our newer businesses from Fund I to Fund II, we are optimistic about the future. Thanks for joining our call. Operator, please open the lines for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Christian Bolu of Crédit Suisse.
Christian Bolu: Your pricing strategy continues to pay off very nicely. You generated almost $193 million. I feel like cash carry, just to be curious and some more color around exactly what you sold or just more color to understanding what drove that?
William J. Janetschek: Chris, this is Bill Janetschek. As it relates to balance sheet earnings, we had several co-invest positions like Nielsen and KION that were sold through secondary offerings that participate alongside our funds. And so, for the most part a lot of the realized gains in the first quarter of our balance sheet came from those co-invest positions.
Christian Bolu: Okay. And any thoughts on trajectory going forward?
William J. Janetschek: Well, it's really hard to predict what the earnings and the cash earnings more importantly are going to be off the balance sheet. We did give you some color as to what we expect in the second quarter. I will tell you that, of that $0.40, I gave you, a predominant amount of that amount is coming from cash carry and not so much cash earnings off the balance sheet because of those secondaries or exits that I mentioned, we don't have significant co-invest off the balance sheet. But again, it's really hard to predict what that number will be next quarter or the remainder of the year.
Christian Bolu: Okay. Just in terms of your retail strategy. You closed down 2 retail funds a couple of months ago, I just appreciate some -- a bit more color on decision to close those funds. And then more broadly, just could you update your thoughts on just go forward strategy, with regards to retail?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure, Christian, it is Scott here. I guess, what I would do is bring it to our strategy in terms of distributing our products to individuals, broadly. And if you look last year, we raised about $21 billion in aggregate. About 23% of that, about $4.7 billion, actually was distributed to individuals across a number of different strategies. And if you look at thus far this year, it's been 1/3 of the capital raised was actually raised from individuals. And that's across a number of different approaches. We have a direct kind of net worth effort. We have a relationship with a number of platforms through whom we distribute our products. We also have our BDC, which is Corporate Capital Trust that raises money from individuals. So just to give you a sense of the $4.7 billion we raised last year, those 2 funds that got a little attention were about $33 million. So it continues to be a significant component of our strategy to continue to reach out the individuals. But I wouldn't get too distracted by those 2 funds. We've got several other vehicles. I think, we raised capital through 15 or 16 vehicles last year across most of the major strategies we raised capital for. So it continues to be an area of focus. I'll tell you that $4.7 billion we raised last year from individuals is up from virtually nothing 3 to 5 years ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I'm hoping, you can tell -- help me with understanding some of your -- Scott, you mentioned the second generation fund. So just curious, if we kind of go down the list of real assets and even some of your Public Markets vehicles where you are kind of more in the market consistently. Where are you seeing strong enough opportunity to invest? Do you think you may be back in the market relatively soon, whether it's real estate or some of the other strategies?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Matt, I guess, I pointed a few different areas. One of our situations where we're nearly out of capital today, and somewhere in the press release, we got our commitment schedule, which shows you kind of -- gives you a sense of how much is committed versus invested. But if you look there what it will tell you is, we're obviously in the market with our European IV fund, on the private equity side, but Infrastructure 2 is vehicle that we're actively out working to raise direct lending to, is also a vehicle that we're actually fund-raising for. And then private capital, more broadly, and our mezzanine fund is nearly fully invested. So those 3 would be kind of more in the very near-term or right now. And then, you got other strategies like special situations, where we recently raised capital, but frankly that money is getting to work quite quickly. So we continue to see opportunities perhaps over time to get to a successor fund faster than perhaps we have initially anticipated. So a variety of different strategies, both on the public and the private market side. It really spans real estate, which is relatively younger, but at the pace we're going right now, we get to work quite quickly. Real assets and credit, so I think, there's a lot of different areas.
Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then following-up on that, so within credit with the Avoca transaction closing, anything you're not doing in Europe and Avoca is not doing either that you think this will help you from a distribution or kind of getting into that market whether it be NPLs or anything else over in Europe that we should be thinking about?
Scott C. Nuttall: No, I think that the integration of Avoca is proceeding quite nicely and the teams are working very well together. And as you know, what we had in Europe before Avoca was largely in the private side. So we had private capital side. We had special situations, mezzanine and Avoca, as you know, is largely more in the liquid credit side. But the teams working together are sourcing a number of interesting transactions. So we have capabilities to do rescue capital. We have capabilities to do NPLs. We can obviously do loan to own, working across our private equity and capstone teams. So we have significant capabilities there. The way I'd think about Avoca is it brings us a team that has covered about 1,300 credits across Europe for a long period of time, and the 2 teams working together is pretty powerful. So that's been proving out quite nicely in early days. There's not a lot that we are not capable of, given the opportunity set that we see today in Europe. One thing we're spending time on is European direct lending, which, as you know, our business in direct lending really started in the U.S. We do see an opportunity in Europe for direct lending, so that will be one strategy. I think, now with the combined capabilities, it's something we're likely to prioritize in the near-term.
Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And last one for me and I'll jump back in. On the real estate front, you mentioned significant opportunity to invest in -- may not be that long till you're back in the market. I'm curious, if there is any plan or thought behind doing real estate debt kind of separating equity and debt into different funds or doing more any debt in real estate going forward?
Scott C. Nuttall: I'd say no immediate plans. We're focused on getting kind of Fund I invested. We had a nice recent exit there in getting that portfolio to perform. So no immediate plans, but we'll keep you up-to-date.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Couple of things. One is the realized cash carry on the private equity side, it was also larger than what we would have thought, looking at publicly announced transactions. Was there something else that either dividend recap or something like that our searches wouldn't have turned up?
William J. Janetschek: Yes, Chris, this is Bill. I mean, just to give you a little more color on this, when you think about cash carry, during the first quarter, it was quite active. I mean, you probably knew about Santander and that going public and not participating in the secondary. We did announce secondaries in Nielsen and NXP and ProSieben and Jazz, as well as KION. And lastly, we did do a small dividend recap in academy in the first quarter, which added about a $0.01 or $0.02. And the one thing that you probably did not allow is, again, when I mentioned earlier in prepared remarks, on the Public Markets side, with that $25 million of cash carry, that actually equated to another $0.02 in that cash carry in the first quarter.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then next, I wonder if you can comment on the indicated value of the Biomet transaction. How does that compare with the March 31 marks?
William J. Janetschek: Just to give you a high-level, Scott had mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, based on where we're carrying it as of March 31, and what was the announced prices that's about a 40% uplift. And when you think about it, we really have Biomet in 2 places, one is through our fund and to give you a little color, that number is about $1.1 billion, of capital in our '06 Fund, plus you might remember that we have about $150 million on our balance sheet. And so those 2 will probably equate to an increase in ENI, based upon the announced price, June 30 of approximately $100 million.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. Then next, as you mentioned that you have realizations out the real estate fund already. Is that something you can or are inclined to recycle or would you rather just distribute that funds and raise a new one?
William J. Janetschek: That's a very good question, Chris. In real estate fund, we could have our cake and eat it too. Because we will actually have that realization. We will pay that out to investors, but because it's in the recycling period, because that investment is less than 18 months, we get to redeploy that capital again.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly for me, it's -- it looks like you had just tremendous appreciation in Europe 3 this quarter, that's really seems to be the biggest driver of the appreciation. And I -- so that -- and that had been a fund obviously, that had struggled through aftermaths of the financial crisis. And I guess, I'm wondering does that kind of appreciation now give you -- have you sized what your goal for Fund IV is I guess is my question? I would've thought it to be tough fund-raising up until recently, but it looks like it's doing pretty well now.
William J. Janetschek: As it relates to appreciation during the quarter, E3 performed quite well. And so we mentioned that in private equity the portfolio is about 4.5% in E3, that portfolio was actually up about 8%. And when you think about it, from where it is from cost to where we're carrying that right now, that fund is that 1.4x cost. And remember, it is -- it's a fund that's only been in existence for 5 years. And so, you really haven't seen the maturity or the write-up in that particular portfolio. As it relates to your second question, on fund-raising, Scott mentioned earlier that we were just starting to market E4 and we rather not comment on size of fund.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: First, just wanted a follow up on the outlook for realizations. Just curious, if you're maybe starting to see any evidence sort of a decoupling between public opportunities versus strategic sales, just given broader market trends and the strength of corporate balance sheet. So maybe potentially entering a period when more of your exits are coming from M&A and less from IPOs and secondary offerings. And if that does in fact turn up to be the case, could that potentially drive maybe a quicker step up and carry as you're not selling down stakes and portfolio companies over the course of the quarters or years?
Scott C. Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. I think it's a great question. It's hard to predict but I think you'll continue to see a mix. If you look kind of going back to 2012 through today, about 60% of exits have been through the Public Markets, and about 30% strategic, and about 10% or 12%, somewhere in there in dividend recaps and other, just to give you a sense of where we've been. And if anything, I would say that given the M&A market has picked up more recently, that 60% in public side, it's quite a bit more than what we would normally expect. So recently, as we said, OB, Avincis, this morning, with Biomet, we are seeing more strategic activity. We sold Ipreo outright. It wasn't too strategic, but it was a sale of the company. So I think it's hard to be too precise. But I would expect that you're going to continue to see a mix of strategic and secondaries going forward. And as we've discussed in the past the strategic exits just tends to be bit more efficient and more of the carry shows up all at once or in a shorter period of time. I will say parenthetically that the at least from what we're seeing, color in the market would tell us that there is more strategic dialogue going on, and there does seem to be strategic interest in our companies, which we've been talking about for last couple of years and it's starting to come through.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe switching gears to fund-raising, it just seems like the breadth of products that you're currently marketing, you mentioned, E4 and infrastructure, direct lending, just seems pretty diverse. So wondering what the implications are for the pace and maybe more importantly, the consistency of your capital formation going forward?
William J. Janetschek: Sure. I'd say there's -- if you look at kind of what's on tap, as I mentioned, on the episodic side, fund-raising side, there is E4, Infra 2, direct lending 2, private capital, maybe European direct lending. And then don't forget, we have the continuous strategies that we raise money for, hedge funds for Prisma direct, credit, high yields, loans, CCT, Avoca has a number of strategies that raise capital continuously. So you will see those vehicles continue to raise capital. An aside, I'd say that it's going to be a bit of different year this year on the capital raising front. Last year we had some of the lumpy big funds with Asia 2 and NAXI. This year we've got E4 but everything else is kind of successor funds that aren't going to be likely of the size of those 2. So we would expect to continue to see good growth in our fee paying assets subject to a couple of things. One, I would tell you that as we have discussed in the past, AUM we think, is a bit of a dangerous metric on its own, and quarterly AUM, I'd tell you we think is a very dangerous metric. So we tend to look over trailing 12 and 24 month period, and fee paying assets were up about 35% in the last 12 months. So this year, I think it's more likely to be more Fund II is coming online. But also a couple of things, one, we have about $4 billion of shadow AUM that we don't talk about that much. This is AUM that's committed, that will turn on when the capital is invested which will start to show up over the coming quarters. I'd also point you to if you're thinking about where we're heading, obviously with KFN, hopefully the transaction gets approved next week, that will actually reduce our fee paying assets but as we discussed in December, materially increase our cash flow and our recurring distribution. So that is something else for you to have in your thought process. But overall, I think, probably the most important thing to remember is that our AUM ignores our balance sheet and our Capital Markets business, which were over half of our earnings in Q1 and in the LTM period. So it's an interesting metric, but for us it's an interesting metric that has implications on about half of how we make money.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Got it. And then, just finally to follow-up on KFN. Just be curious to get maybe your current thoughts on how you're thinking about reinvestment opportunities as the KFN CLOs wind down? And what sort of ROE expectations are you targeting both in the near term and over time as far as the underlying mix on the investments on the balance sheet continues to evolve?
Scott C. Nuttall: I'd say there is no real change from last quarter on that, Michael. Our perspective is that we kind of view that we're going to run the balance sheet as a holistic balance sheet. And you know that ROEs we've been able to generate on the balance sheet the last couple of years which are materially higher than what KFN has been generating on its own. So we continue to see opportunities across all of our businesses and strategies. And perhaps in future quarters, we can dig into that a bit more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.
Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Thanks. My question has already been asked. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.
M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP: Could you give us an update on performance at Prisma and maybe break out the organic growth and how that's been tracking?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. I guess, it's Scott. Performance has been good. We had a strong year last year. And I would say it is in line with or ahead of our expectations, frankly. AUM today is probably $10.5 billion give or take up from $7 billion or $8 billion when we closed the deal. So the performance has been strong both from the standpoint of the underlying investment performance. The financial performance has been very strong. And we had a good incentive year last year. And AUM is on or ahead of our expectations. So far so good. There's been a bit of choppiness in the markets as of late, which is going to bring down performance a little bit on the year-to-date basis, but tends to create investing opportunities as well. So far, continues to be ahead of our expectations overall.
William J. Janetschek: Right and Patrick, this is Bill, just to give you a little color on performance. Remember the S&P was only up 1.8%, and Prisma actually outperformed their benchmark by a pretty nice delta. Also as it relates to first quarter when we're talking about the capital raised, $700 million of capital that was raised this quarter actually came from Prisma.
M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP: Were there any meaningful redemptions?
William J. Janetschek: Less than the capital that was raised, it's their point. The total capital raised, as I said, was $700 million, the redemptions were about $350 million. But net-net AUM grows because of performance and new net capital raised.
M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP: Okay, great. And then finally, a broader question on Asia and China, given your success there over a long period of time and lot of dry powder obviously. I'm just curious as discussion has been percolating around a credit event there or more distress there. If you are seeing any opportunities starting to emerge from that, that kind of chatter and discussion?
Scott C. Nuttall: Davitt, Patrick, this Scott. Yes, absolutely. I think the volatility creates good investment opportunity for us and good entry points. Recent example is we announced we were buying a stake in a company called Haier, which is a white goods manufacturer company in China. I think the EBITDA multiple is 3x or 4x EBITDA or something like that. So it is creating market and dislocations and opportunities for us. And so, we are investing into that dislocations and noise. And I'd say overall, the emerging market pullback both Asia also Latin America is creating some opportunities for us, and the good news is as you've said, we have capital at the ready. So it was good timing on the Asia fund raise, and now we're excited to put it to work.
William J. Janetschek: And just a little more color around Asia just as far as capital deployment. Of the $4 plus billion that Scott had mentioned that we've either invested in the first quarter or we plan to invest in the second quarter, about $1.3 billion or about 35% of that is being deployed in Asia. So we're quite excited about the opportunities there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Most of them have been asked and answered, but maybe just an extension of Matt's question on Europe with Avoca closed. Maybe looking at longer term, Scott, if you could sort of comment what your ambitions are to further leverage your credit capabilities there? And I guess, what I'm getting at is really to scale them up and maybe if you could sort of give some color on the European marketplace and the opportunities that you think will be presented over the next say 1 to 2, maybe even 3 years, and whether there is interest or appetite to further acquisitions to scale up that opportunity?
Scott C. Nuttall: Great. Thanks, Brian. One, I think in terms of let's talk about what the business looks like today. So in aggregate, we manage about $30 billion in our credit business, as I said about $12 billion of that is now in Europe. And I think we expect that, that number will continue to scale as we combine the private credit capabilities and the liquid credit capabilities that I referenced earlier. And in terms of the nature of the opportunity set, I'd say, it's very broad-based. It's everything from the liquid side where we're starting to see activity again in the European CLO markets where Avoca has been a meaningful player and the European CLO market's starting to come back much like the U.S. market did coming out of our crisis here. So there is opportunities to continue to print CLOs. It's an interesting potential investment for our balance sheet, and also a fee generating opportunity but there is also opportunities for the leverage loan separate account type vehicles, which continue to garner quite a bit of interest from investors looking to play the European recovery. Perhaps, most exciting as we sit here today is the opportunity to be on the private credit side in Europe. And that's very broad based. It's everything from direct lending, which I referenced earlier for companies that frankly the European banks are internally focused and they don't have access to funding any more. So we're able to, much like we did in the U.S., provide them with senior secured loans through the mezzanine part of the capital structure. The high-yield market in Europe is not as well developed and so it provides opportunities for us in our mezzanine business. And most of our mezzanine fund has actually been put to work in Europe. So we expect that that will continue to be an interesting -- an important area for us. And then our special situations group is very active in Europe as well. And it's everything from buying loans off bank balance sheets to doing rescue finance. It's largely been the latter of those. It's largely been, frankly, companies that need help, where their traditional funding sources are no longer willing to help them. That's created the opportunity for us. So I would say, you add all that up you're talking about a market opportunity and a supply demand imbalance that is huge compared to the capital that we manage. And so that gets us pretty excited about our ability to scale that $12 billion in that European credit business meaningfully over the course of the next several years as we invest into that dislocation. It's hard to size that, but we're pretty enthused about it. And the question on acquisitions, I think the short answer is, yes. We'd consider makings other acquisitions in European credit. There's got to be a good cultural fit and it has to add to what our team already brings. As I mentioned before, we think, we got it pretty well covered now pro forma, but if there's something that fits well, we definitely take a look.
Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's great. Maybe just one last one on Capital Markets. The activity was good this quarter, maybe just your outlook for the balance of the year. Certainly good year-on-year performance in cap markets and just maybe comments on seasonality versus your expectations for the balance of the year.
William J. Janetschek: It's really -- this is Bill. It's really hard to predict what the rest of the year looks like, but I can certainly comment on the quarter. We had a pretty robust number, and quite interestingly, 45% of the revenue came from non-U.S. activity. So that is either in Europe or in Asia, and roughly about 25% came from our third-party business, which we only launched a couple of years ago. Activity was quite robust. We actually transacted with over 40 portfolio companies, either third party or KKR existing during that quarter. And so, we're optimistic, now that, that business has been online through 5 or 6 years, that we continue to just build traction.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question, maybe for Bill, just really curious -- thanks for all the updates into the second quarter. When you step beyond that and maybe pro forma the news of what you have already sold, can you give us an update on percentage of the portfolio of carry that are now cash eligible if you will, and then what percentage of the portfolio companies are publicly traded?
William J. Janetschek: Sure, Bill. As it relates to when you take a look at the funds that we actually manage, right now, roughly 20% of those investments are in public security. And I'm sorry, what was your second question?
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just what percentage of eligible carry we have over now that fairly carry?
William J. Janetschek: I'm happy to report that when you take a look at all of our mature funds, every single mature fund is in position to pay cash carry. There are a couple of immature funds, and so when you look at the total of about the $38 billion, 2 immature funds both China growth and Asia II, which just came online. Obviously, are not in a position to pay cash carry. So roughly about 95% of our funds, to the extent we have realization, would be in position to pay cash carry.
Scott C. Nuttall: And Bill, it's Scott. One other interesting metric if you look at the unrealized value in our private equity portfolio, it's about $38 billion. About half of that is 2009 and prior. So as you think about a meaningful amount of the portfolio, nearly $20 billion is in more mature stage of its life cycle.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And away from the funds that we managed, because I'm sure you'll ask a follow-up question, so I'll try to beat you to the punch. As it relates to our balance sheet, roughly about 30% of that portfolio is in public liquid securities.
Craig Larson: And the final though on that, Bill, is, when you think of whether it's Walgreens or the U.S. Foods transaction or certainly, the stock component from Biomet, those would all not be included as it relates to those percentage public statistics.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's helpful. And then just coming back I apologize this is that type of question. But in the quarter, on the fee related earnings side you did benefit pretty nicely from a step up of monitoring -- net monitoring transaction fees. I guess, is the moral of the call here that with just a pickup in activity levels that maybe a little bit better run rate all else being equal or anyway to sort of think through what a more normalized level might be?
William J. Janetschek: Bill, that's going to be hard to predict. You are right, the transaction activity was robust in this quarter, and you can see that the transaction fees both on the Private Markets side and just as importantly, on the Capital Market side were robust. You did see a little pickup in monitoring fees, and there I can give you a little color. We actually -- when we took Pets public, received a termination payment of roughly $8 million. And so that's a one-time number. So what you should think about as far as monitoring fees for your modeling is roughly in the $30 million range each quarter.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just final one certainly, it sounds like a lot of things are going well in a lot of different parts of the business. Scott maybe for you, just maybe an update in terms of LP penetration in terms of what you're seeing in terms of new growth versus existing LPs?
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I'd say we continue to make progress. I think, we're at 735 investors now, up from 275 or so when we really began our focus on investing and building out our distribution team. Cross sell at about 1.6. As we've talked about in the past, there is a little bit of tension obviously, when you add a new investor, you add usually one product, but it stayed steady at 1.6 despite the growth in the number of investors that we have. I'd say, the interest hasn't been quite broad based. One of the things we look at, is if you look at the percentage of the capital we raise that comes from new investors versus those that have been with us for a long time. For example, the EIGF fund that we just closed. 52% by number of investors are new, and it was 37% of the capital we raised. And so we continue to see those types of statistics in these newer vehicles and the interest is broad based. I commented before on the individual investor market, but we're also seeing expansion in terms of what we're doing with pension plans, Sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations. So it's global and it's across multiple different types of investors.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And if I could just maybe ask one more. I think, there was an article on Bloomberg cite some unnamed sources that regulators might be looking into some of the economics on the private equity side. Specifically, I think, around some of the ancillary revenues and pricing dynamics. Is there any -- been any change in tone coming out of regulators in terms of looking at the business or is that story a little off base?
William J. Janetschek: There's nothing that we're aware of that we would point you to as changing our view of the business or the outlook.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just curious to know if that some of the last couple and putting aside the KFN transaction, whether it was in Prisma, Avoca, the investment in Nephila. And certainly your willingness and ability, willingness maybe to look outside for inorganic opportunities to expand and grow the business has picked up. So as we look forward, what are you thinking particularly as you bring on the assets from KFN, which gives you even more flexibility about where you see are there opportunity, or desire to deploy that in an organic way and accelerate growth?
Scott C. Nuttall: Robert, it's Scott. I guess, we do have a focused effort around identifying corporate development opportunities for the firm. It's primarily focused in a few areas. First, I'd say hedge funds. So you mentioned Nephila, where we bought a 25% stake. We now have a dedicated effort looking at stakes and potential feeding opportunities for hedge funds. And we created one unified hedge fund platform with the Prisma team to make sure that we've got the diligence in place, and kind of the brains behind the hedge fund business working all together. So it's -- that's a specific area. Those are opportunities we're not focused on raising a fund. That's something that we would do with the balance sheet. It's more of a strategic effort. The next major effort I would say, think of it as globalizing some of the newer businesses that we built. So as you look at real estate or energy or credit, obviously with the Avoca deal, but looking at opportunities, U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America to expand those businesses globally. That's another area that we're focused on. And it's not so much adding new legs to the stool as expanding the legs that we've started and continuing to scale the businesses that we've begun in the last few years. Very hard to predict what's going to get done if anything. But we're focused on it, and we found that although, it's a bit of a needle in the haystack effort, over the last couple of years, we found some very interesting opportunities and I'd anticipate that we would continue to do so. Although, the precise areas is going to be a little bit hard to predict.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Great. This is a maybe a follow-up to Bill's question. There was a few weeks ago that article talked that the FCC be looking at so-called hidden fees that they claim some firms are charging portfolio companies undisclosed LPs. So just -- how should we think about that in the context of KKR or your thoughts on that?
William J. Janetschek: Well, again, Scott mentioned this earlier, we really haven't heard much about this. Other than what I do want to comment on is, I have read some of the articles and it is talking about fees charged to portfolio companies. And when we think about it, especially in private equity space, and especially as it relates to KKR, we've got a fee sharing agreement with our LPs, where they get 80% of the economic and we get 20%. And so at the end of the day, it's for the most part very interesting but really not applicable.
Craig Larson: Rob this is Craig. The other thing on that, just to bear in mind, we have been registered as an investment advisor now for several years. And, our legal and compliance area also has probably been a growth area within the firm. So just as you think about those factors, I think, those are other things you should also bear in mind.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just one last question. Thinking about the hedge fund platform. Just kind of curious you started the long/short equity effort couple of years ago, seeding that and kind of curious how that's been. Where that is at this point in terms of fund-raising or ability to fund-raising.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, sure. I would point you more broadly. We've got 3 and more direct hedge fund efforts inside the firms. So you got the long/short equity which you referenced, Robert, but we've also got 2 credit vehicles. We have a credit long/short vehicle that's more global and then with Avoca, actually, they have nice credit long/short business in Europe that's focused on investing in that part of the world. So all 3 of those efforts continue to scale, I'd say, our long/short equity effort as I mentioned last year we had pulled back on the fund-raising side. We were up 18% gross last year in that business. The performance has been good. Managed a bit over $500 million of capital there. And the 2 credit vehicles are also beginning to scale nicely. So we'll give other updates over time. You can see in our disclosure on our balance sheet that the money that we invested there from the balance sheet is up quite a bit since we invested it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America.
Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Bill, just on the distribution outlook, I think you mentioned $0.40. I just want to make sure you're just talking about the cash carry into the balance sheet not looking at the fee earnings. And then, you mentioned 2 exits, Ipreo and then U.S. Foods, that you didn't include, and given the timing of those, just I guess, any indication whether it's in the back half of the year, what that can contribute?
William J. Janetschek: Sure, I'm glad you brought this up. Just to be clear, the $0.40 that I was referencing is cash carry or realized balance sheet income with the majority of that coming from cash carry. It does not include any fee related earnings, and if you take a look at what our fee related earnings are over the last 5 or 6 quarters, that number has not been below $0.10 a quarter. And so if you added that to the $0.40, we would be looking at for the second quarter a $0.50 number. As it relates to Ipreo, that transaction which obviously isn't in that $0.40, we expect to close in the third quarter. And we're cautiously optimistic on U.S. Foods that, that would close probably in the fourth quarter. It could be in the third quarter, but more likely than not in the fourth quarter. And last but not least with Biomet which we just announced this morning, we're not actually going to see that hit in 2014 and we expect that to come through in the first quarter of 2015.
Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then last, you guys gave a lot of color on, I guess, the portfolio, the percentage of the funds that are in carry, so you're well-positioned there, and then also the percent that's public. So it seems like from an exit standpoint in distributions things are relatively well positioned. I think, just on the fund-raising side, and Scott, you hit on this, with kind of the bigger funds that are out there, but I think a lot of the smaller opportunities that can obviously add up to something significant over time. When you guys are thinking over the next 12, 24 months, despite pretty good like exit backdrop, are you still looking at whether it's organic or inorganic? You still being able to, on a net basis, grow your assets over time? I understand the quarterly variabilities and that kind of stuff.
Scott C. Nuttall: I guess it's a little bit hard to predict, Mike. And I'd say that it's a little bit of good news bad news, right? When we sell something and generate a big carry payout, our AUM goes down. So by virtue of the investment capital behind that investment, and so that's just something to keep an eye on. I mentioned KFN. That's going to reduce our fee paying AUM, but meaningfully increase our cash flow. And our recurring distribution, which we said in December, we said, that would be up 28% a unit pro forma for KFN. So that's -- that's good news. But fee paying AUM will be down. And so I really do think that for us, AUM is a pretty dangerous metric to get too fixated on. You can't eat AUM. You can spend cash flow, you can spend dividend per share, and that's what we're focused on generating. So we're not going to predict outcomes, but as I mentioned, we have got a lot of different funds in the market. We do have as Bill said a 50% or so increase in our fees year-over-year, and so we continue to see these newer businesses scale and new funds come online. But what I would focus you on more is our distributable earnings and our distribution. And AUM, we may choose to strategically bring down if things like KFN come up where we can make more money for all of our shareholders per share by doing it. But we're not going to predict there. But we'll keep you updated on the individual fund-raises along the way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery of Sanford Bernstein.
Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So the big picture on European credit was helpful but maybe establish some specifics. On the Italian nonperforming loan deal with Intesa and Unicredit. Are you able to maybe help us size a potential for that transaction? I guess, it's EUR 2 billion in loans from those 2 banks, but could this special-purpose vehicle be expanded to include loans from other banks? And then, will you be initially funding that with your own balance sheet or require AUM? Or will maybe the vehicle issue CLO through Avoca and if so approximately what kind of yields, funding costs and spreads could we be talking about there?
Scott C. Nuttall: That's a lot of specificity. I'd say, the Italian NPL deal which was briefly mentioned in the press the other day, not going to be able to give you a lot of color on that. Those conversations are ongoing. Whatever we do in European credit will be a combination of our balance sheet and third-party capital. So it could be funds and balance sheet. And depending on how much of the assets we like it could be a very significant opportunity for the firm over time. But it's just too early to be able to say. But obviously we're, as I mentioned, excited about what's going on in European credit and have a lot of resources focused and dedicated there. And they're trying to bring as much creativity to it as we can. So sorry to not to give you more specificity, but that's about all we can say at this point.
Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Then just on that tax overhaul in front of Congress right now. I guess, it's author, David Camp, has announced that he is going to retire. I don't think that was a surprise, but even though I think he would like to make his swan song it sounds like he probably lacks support from his own party and he has less than 9 months to get it done before he leaves. So I am just curious how you're feeling about the threat of tax changes near term? And then if you share the longer term view that momentum is slowly building toward a tax change for how the BTPs are taxed?
William J. Janetschek: On the former, I agree with your comment. The probability of anything probably going through in short-term is probably not there. Long-term, it's hard to predict. We have all talked about the taxation of carried interest. Since we've been public, it continues to come up down in Washington episodically. And I hate to put it back to you, but your guess is as good as mine.
Operator: And our last question comes from Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My question was already answered when you guys said that portion of the portfolio that was public was not pro forma for the recent exit.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time.
Craig Larson: Okay, great. Thank you everybody for joining us. Look forward to chatting with you next quarter. If you have any follow-ups in advance, please feel free to give either me a call or Sara.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-01-31 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Pam [Testani] - Head-Investor Relations Craig Farr - Chief Executive Officer Mike McFerran - Chief Operating Officer and CFO 
Analysts:  Daniel Furtado - Jefferies 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Pam [Tolan], Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.
Pam Testani: Thank you, operator. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. I’m joined this morning by Craig Farr, our CEO; and Mike McFerran, our COO and CFO. As a reminder, we’ll be discussing forward-looking statements on today’s call, which do not guarantee future events or performance and are subject to substantial risks that are described in greater detail, both in our SEC filings and in the supplemental information presentation posted to our website. Actual results may vary materially from today’s statements. Any non-GAAP measures, we reference are reconciled to GAAP figures in our supplement. I’ll start the call off with fourth quarter performance highlights and a quick update on the acquisition by KKR that we announced on December 16th. Then Mike will give you more detail on our results and Craig will go over progress against the goals we laid out last quarter. This morning we reported fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders of $62 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. This compares to $33 million or $0.16 per diluted common share for Q3. The increase was driven primarily by a higher level of gains on investments in a quarter where we saw rallies in both credit and equity markets. We ended the year with book value per common share of $10.58, up from $10.42 at September 30th. And in connection with these results, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $0.22 per common share for the fourth quarter which is consistent with the third quarter. The distribution is payable on February 27th to common shareholders of record as of February 13th. And before I hand things over to Mike, I want to touch quickly on the transaction that we announced with KKR. As you’ll recall, based on the unanimous recommendation of an Independent Transaction Committee, our Board approved KKR’s acquisition of KFN, the 0.51 KKR common units per KFN common share. The transaction is still subject to approval by a majority of KFN common shares as well as satisfaction of various other closing conditions including customary regulatory approval. On January 15th, KKR filed a preliminary S-4 registration statement with the SEC. The S-4 is currently under review and has not yet become effective, so unfortunately we’re limited in terms of questions you can ask at the moment. But that said we are working to hold a shareholders’ meeting as soon as possible. We urge you to read the proxy statement and the prospectus included in the S-4 as well as any other relevant materials that we or KKR files, because they’ll contain important information regarding the transaction. And I’ll now pass it to Mike.
Mike McFerran: Thank you, Pam. And thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. As Pam mentioned, we generated $62 million of net income to common shareholders for the fourth quarter, which implies an annualized return on equity of over 11% for the quarter. This compares with $33 million or 6% return on equity for the third quarter. This quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings was primarily driven by a $27 million increase in other income, nearly all from net investment gains. For the third quarter, net investment gains totaled only $6 million. In contrast for the fourth quarter, they were $32 million as strong equity and credit market performance growth unrealized and to a lesser extent realized gains. While investment gains will inherently be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter as we’ve talked about in the past, on average we’d expect them to be somewhere between these last two quarters’ results, given our current portfolio mix. Included in our $32 million of net investment gains is a $10 million charge against certain of our natural resources properties. We took an impairment due to a combination of unfavorable pricing in one asset and uneconomic [growth] in another. But it doesn’t compromise our general outlook for the reminder of the assets in the strategy. With respect to top line results, total revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 8% for a $129 million to a $140 million. This was primarily driven by a few items. First, we received $4 million in dividends in certain mezzanine and private equity holdings, these tend to be non-recurring. Second, interest income increased $4 million. This was driven primarily from higher coupon income in our loan portfolio, which grew about 5% since the third quarter. Finally, oil and gas revenue increased $3 million quarter-over-quarter. The improvements in revenues and other income were partly offset by expenses, both investment related and operating. On the investment side, we added $12 million to our allowance for loan losses. This was driven by two factors. First, two of our impaired loan positions, Longview Power and [Large Net] declined in price during the quarter. This increased the allocated components of our allowance, since we have a specific reserve against both of these. Second, our loans held for investment portfolio increased in size by $278 million or approximately 5% as we previously mentioned. Our total allowance for loan loss at year end as a percentage of our held for investment portfolio remains constant to what it was in the third quarter at 3.6%. Next, cash results. On a cash basis, we generated $0.17 of run rate and $0.25 of total net cash earnings per common share for the fourth quarter. As you’ve seen our supplement, we've also shown a pro forma version of these figures on page 34, which vary in how we recognize cash from our development focused natural resource assets. Our historical approach uses GAAP DD&A to determine cost recovery with any access in cash received above the DD&A amount being attributable to cash income. The pro forma number includes, on the other hand, cost recovery based on total proved reserves, which GAAP DD&A doesn’t entirely capture for these development assets. On this basis, run rate cash earnings were $0.19 per common share and total net cash earnings were $0.27 per common share. We think this alternative method provides a more consistent way of looking at our equity amortization across all of our sub-strategies, especially as development assets have become a bigger part of the portfolio. In terms of deployment, we had a very active fourth quarter, which Craig will discuss in a moment. In addition to cash on hand, we have funded this in a few ways. We saw certain rated notes in our 2007-1 and 2007-A CLOs for $94 million of proceeds. We also drew $75 million of the 150 available under our revolving credit facility to bridge timing differences of asset funding and realizations. We ended the quarter with $157 million of unrestricted cash, all of which was committed to opportunities we expect to fund in coming months. And with that I’m going to hand this to Craig.
Craig Farr: Thanks Mike. Overall, we are pleased with the fourth quarter as we’ve fallen true in some of our key objectives; we laid those out in our third quarter call. First, we wanted to simplify our portfolio by narrowing future capital commitments to three strategies from six. And second, we really wanted to increase our capital deployment, in particular cash yielding strategies like CLOs. We thought this would help us grow our cash EPS over time which we are (inaudible) this key objective. And our activity in the fourth quarter was consistent with those priorities. In the fourth quarter alone, we deployed or committed more than $420 million across the strategies, net of turnover such as situation portfolio. Over $315 million of that was deployed during the quarter and about $240 million of that went into those three core strategies; CLOs, specialty lending, opportunistic credit. While we continue to fund our historical commitments to non-core strategies such as real estate and natural resources, as Mike just went through, we’re continuing to emphasize migrating our capital to areas where we believe KFN’s differentiated capital base is especially advantageous. Let’s look at those three core areas. In CLOs, we mentioned increasing our exposure by tapping three sources, KKR CLOs; third-party CLOs, the new area for us; and then Avoca CLOs. While KKR has not completed the Avoca acquisition yet, we did execute in those first two areas. We placed the new CLO in late December, CLO 2013-2, which just closed last week. This was a $384 million deal with $45 million of sub-notes, all of which KFN retained. We also participated in our first third-party control deal where we acquired approximately $30 million of subordinated notes and a new CLO managed by Sound Point. Sound Point is an affiliate of Stone Point who we all know well through our joint venture with KKR at MerchCap Solutions. Additionally, we added to our position in our own 2012-1 transaction by buying more of the sub-notes in the secondary market. We’d only bought 52% of those had issuance. And on the specialty lending side, we continue to see opportunities by managing long duration hard asset. You're all witnessing the regulatory environment for banks where they are being forced to focus on appropriately short-lived more liquid assets. And we funded an additional $32 million of our $150 million commitment to Maritime Finance Company. We also executed on two more of these specialty lending opportunities in the fourth quarter. First, as many of you saw from our press release a few weeks ago, we committed $105 million to LCI Helicopters to help extend their global helicopter leasing business, partnering with Libra Group. We funded $50 million in the fourth quarter. We're very excited about the opportunity there. We believe it's an underpenetrated market in leasing and we continue to be focused again in those types of opportunities. And then, we committed $20 million to a business called Battery Point Financial, of which we funded $2.5 million in the fourth quarter. This is a new entity focused on acquiring a portfolio of contracts for deal, which is a form of non-mortgage home financing that we believe offers attractive risk adjusted returns. Similar to Maritime Finance, we've taken an equity interest in both of these companies and we expect these to generate regular distributions of course over time as their portfolios are ramped. And lastly, opportunistic credit. This continues to be an exciting year, which includes mezzanine and stock situation. We deployed $80 million net of proceeds from sales during the quarter and we committed another $28 million that we expect to fund shortly. As we've been saying, we continue to believe that illiquidity premium associated with these private credit transactions is attractive for all of you as shareholders. The remainder of our deployment in the fourth quarter was the legacy commitments into our non-core strategies. So we’ve made good progress on our objectives as we last talked. We’re continuing to focus on the best risk adjusted returns the high yielding opportunities where capital is most viable. Thank you very much for joining us. And we’re happy to take any questions you have.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Daniel Furtado of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Good morning everybody. Thank you for the opportunity.
Craig Farr: Hi, Daniel.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: I just have two or three real quick questions, the first was the fallen the interest expense to affiliates. I assume that some CLO redemption is driving that but not sure?
Mike McFerran: Yeah. To affiliates you have to really look at interest expense to affiliates adjust interest expense on the CLO [allowance] and any affiliates no longer owned allowance from third parties due that is just a reclassification of line items.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Understood, that’s what I figured. And then the second question was just on the run rate slide for the bank loans and high yield, it looks like it came in pretty materially from quarter-to-quarter. Is that just some noise or how should I think about that delta there?
Mike McFerran: (Inaudible) but that’s fine Dan, let me take a look at it.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Sure. And when you look at that Mike if I could throw my last one in there, just kind of some update I get it on the helicopter play and the liquidity premium, but in terms of Maritime Finance specifically in that space, do you still see that as attractive as you did when you initially got into the business?
Craig Farr: We do. Dan, it’s Craig. I think like every asset class there is no question that yields are starting to, obviously come down in every single class as you said have a lot of more cap in the markets. But the team has found especially in the area they’re looking at given the size of the loan rates that there [is a plan] above a lot of the market and are really still sourcing really interesting opportunities.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Great. Well, thank you for the color on that point.
Mike McFerran: And Daniel, on the interest income point, you know the run rate of the bank yield and loan strategy is actually expanding. What you’re really seeing is the timing of deployment versus when we actually started receiving revenues from that.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay.
Mike McFerran: So as Craig talked about some of those transactions we did were really at the end of the quarter. You can see the benefit of those (inaudible) is taken into Q1.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay.
Craig Farr: We are facing probably (inaudible) some of that compression through that CLO issuance and some of the other credit strategy, Daniel so I think that’s exactly what we are trying to [outstand] I think. Going forward as Mike said, it was doing better with that trending.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Great, thank you for the color everybody. I really appreciate it.
Mike McFerran: Thanks, Daniel.
Craig Farr: Thank you.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Charles Matthews of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. You had mentioned $157 million in unrestricted cash which are expected to fund in the future. But you obviously have some other financing sources. I was wondering could you give us a sense for what your total investment commitments are at this point? I am assuming it’s above that $157 million?
Mike McFerran: Yeah, unfunded, it’s actually about that amount. Today, we view ourselves as fully deployed. And while there is always a little bit of timing between when you monetize certain positions or when you deploy capital of others, I’d say our unfunded commitments are about that amount.
Unidentified Analyst:  And if I could, if could just ask a quick follow-up, I know you mentioned that investments during the quarter. If I could recap you said it was $350 million during the fourth quarter and $50 million subsequent to that, is that correct?
Craig Farr: Yeah.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And at this time, I am not showing any further questions. I’d like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.
Pam Testani: I think we are all set for now. Thank you very much operator. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. That does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Analysts: John Hecht - Stephens Daniel Furtado - Jefferies Joel Houck - Wells Fargo Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Pam Testani. Ma’am, the floor is yours.
Pam Testani: Thank you, Harry. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. I’m joined by Craig Farr, CEO; and Mike McFerran, our COO and CFO. As a reminder, we’ll be discussing forward-looking statements on today’s call, which are based on management’s belief. These don’t guarantee future events or performance and are subject to substantial risks that are described in greater detail both in our SEC filings and in the supplemental information presentation posted to our website. Actual results may vary materially from today’s statements. We’ll also refer to non-GAAP measures, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in the supplement. I’ll start with some third quarter highlights and then I’ll turn it to Mike and Craig. With Craig taking over a CEO of KFN last quarter, we have undertaken a review of the business. Craig and Mike will give you a fresh assessment of where we are today and where we’d like to go from here to drive value for our shareholders. This afternoon we reported third quarter net income available to common shareholders of $33 million or $0.16 per diluted common share. This compares to $79 million or $0.39 per diluted common share for the second quarter. The largest driven of this decline were lower level of investment gains than in Q2, as well as the fact that we took an incremental provision for loan losses. At the end of Q3, our book value was $10.42 per common share, up from $10.41 at June 30th. We had a very good quarter for capital deployment across our strategies, leaving us with $222 million of cash at September 30th, down from $508 million at the end of Q2. Our Board of Directors has declared the cash distribution of $0.22 per common share for the third quarter, which is up from $0.21 in each of the last five quarters. The distribution is payable on November 20th to common shareholders of record as of November 6th. And finally for those who haven’t seen, we’ve begin posting trustee reports for all of our CLOs to our website. Many of you have asked for more details on the CLOs and how they amortize, they having monthly data on their performance should be helpful. And I’ll now pass it to Mike.
Mike McFerran: Thanks, Pam, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. I’m going to cover a few topics, first, this quarter’s results and our earnings trajectory, second, where our portfolio is today, third, our capital deployment and liquidity position, and finally, I’ll spend a moment on our distribution and taxation. Starting with the results, our third quarter net income available to common shareholders was $33 million or $0.16 per diluted common share versus $79 million last quarter or $0.39. It’s easier to understand this decline, if you think about things in terms of run rate and then gain-related earnings. Our run rate earnings this quarter [surpassing] everything gains and incentive fees, $0.13 a share or $0.18 if you add back the impact of the loan loss provision we talk. Decline from $0.23 from the second quarter to an adjusted $0.18 this quarter is largely attributable to fewer prepayments in the third consistent with the broader market. We had a $666 million of prepayments on the par base of $6.7 billion in the second quarter versus only $122 million on the base of $6.5 billion to the third quarter. That was $11 million of the $12 million decline in our interest income from the second quarter. On the gain-related side, we had $0.03 per share of other income for the third quarter versus about $0.18 for the second quarter. These earnings had come from two places. First, gains embedded in our bank loan high yield bond portfolio, which have largely resided in our quite KKR Holdings and second, mark-to-market or exits on our total return-oriented strategies, as well as hedges and foreign currency. We have been exiting our quite [KKR] positions. Many of which we held far below par and that was around par, which has driven material gains in the last few years. But the portfolio has turned -- has turned over now and only minimal embedded gains that portfolio today. So that source of gain-related earnings has run scores. Future gains will come primarily from our special situations, real estate and private equity strategies, which only makeup about $350 million of our $2.1 billion net equity base today. So while we do expect gains to be a regular part of our earnings in the future, there will probably be a lesser degree that we have seen in recent quarters. And as I mentioned, we did record a provision for loan loss in this quarter, raising our allowance by $9 million to $213 million. Our held for investment loan portfolio grew from $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion during the quarter, largely through our ramp-up of CLO 2013-1. So this provision keeps our allowance in-line with June 30 at 3.6%. We have had one default in the last call, Longview Power, which we hold by $50 million cost in our CLO. We have previously impaired this position in an anticipation of the default and hope to now get a reserve against it based on its current market value. We ended the quarter with book value per common share of $10.42, a slight increase from June 30th. This reflects a 6% total return on equity for the third quarter. Part of this lower return on equity which is down from 15% last quarter is that our gains are normalizing. But this quarter’s results are actually below our ongoing expectations because of the provision we took and the fact a lot of our real asset holdings have ran to their full income generating level yet. Let me go through our current portfolio to understand how we view the outlook for each of our strategies. At a high level, everything is tracking well, except the portion of natural resources portfolio. Even there we think downsize of cost recovery are little better. Our CLOs are performing quite well. Collectively, they’re still generating a 15% annualized cash yield for the third quarter, while these structures do most of our CLOs are winding down. About $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion, we have deployed the CLOs are in pre-priced deals, all of which will be amortizing by May of next year. We are focused on capital, migrating capital to new CLOs to offset the one-off of the legacy warrants. We’ve done two new deals the last year and upsized another one, deploying about $160 million and we hope to pick up our issuance pace from here. Our mezzanine and special situations assets have also done extremely well. These opportunistic credit holdings are less cash flow heavy than the CLOs however. So, while we expect the low to mid teens returns on this capital on the aggregate, there is definitely a gain components with these assets. Our private equity assets are on track, but they are smaller part of our book will be very launch on holdings. Until we see exists, they’ll contribute mark-to-market gains and losses from quarter-to-quarter but no recurring income. In natural recourses, the picture is quite bifurcated. Exploitation, which involves proved assets producing multi-natural gas and natural gas liquids is underperforming our expectations. Our other two streams have performed according to plan. These are Development, where we fund the drilling of oil heavy properties and Royalties where we have the rights on revenue share in certain acreage if the gas produced. In Exploitation, we haven’t been able to go much out of our assets as we’ve underwritten in large parts lower natural gas and liquids prices. Result of that excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of our hedges earnings have been flat for the last few quarters. On the cash basis which would add back non-cash depreciation expenses, we are seeing some income $4 million to $5 million in each of the second and third quarters of this year. While this is what we hope for we think that downsize is reasonable that we get our money back with low single-digit returns plus embedded auction on natural gas prices. In the meantime, we’ll try to maximize the value of what we have by reducing expenses. Development and Royalties are contributing positive GAAP and cash income at this point. Royalties will probably slowdown mid next year. While Development is continued to grow, oil prices remain strong. Next our real estate strategy which as of quarter end we are deploying approximately $147 million to nine investments. We’d expect to see some recurring revenue and cash flow from this portfolio starting in 2014 really ramping up in 2015. Because of the nature of these assets though, a good portion of our expected mid-teen return is likely to come through mark-to-market gains and exist the positions. So that’s our current portfolio. Moving on to capital deployment on liquidity, we ended the quarter $222 million cash versus $508 million at June 30th. Needless to say, it’s been the strong quarter for deployment. I went through few of the key transactions and also our current commitments, which we believe are likely to account for the rest of our cash on hand. We upsized CLO 2011-1 by $300 million, this has given an additional $75 million from KFN and a $225 million increase in the loan facility provided by the third-party. This upsize enables us to pull on the life of a highly attractive and opportunistic structure that’s generated approximately $0.15 annualized cash returns since its inception. Next, we have committed $150 million to a new company called Maritime Finance. We’ve backed an experienced team to run to new Maritime assets. The idea is to make distributions to equity investors like KFN from the asset yield, many management fees the team earns from investing third party’s money and these assets. We funded $84 million so far and expect to remain to be funded over the next 12 months. You will see this sharpen our private equity strategy for the time being, even though it was in the long sight of KKR PE fund since it is an unconsolidated equity stake. In real estate, we deployed $44 million in the third quarter, $34 million of which from the three new investments. This included a $19 million investments in the shopping center portfolio in the U.K. and another $9 million investments in office building repairs. We expect to fund another $45 million to $50 million to existing assets over the next three, six months. Through our natural resources strategy, we deployed $57 million, $33 million of this was through new drilling partnership with EXCO Resources, an exploration and production company to acquire and develop acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale. In special situations in mezzanine, we deployed about $70 million to new opportunities, net of proceeds for sales during the quarter. We’ve also identified specific opportunities in these strategies, which we think will require up to an additional $100 million of capital deployment before year end, though these opportunities haven’t climbed up yet. In addition, we have capital till March to fund between $200 million and $240 million to existing natural resource commitment. This includes about $135 million to existing drilling transactions and $50 million for our royalties’ joint venture, which we expect to play over the next few years. Finally, our Board acquired a $0.22 per share on cash distribution to common shareholders for the third quarter, which is a $0.01 increase from the past five quarters of $0.21. I do want to spend a moment on our distribution in relation to taxes and our corporate structure. The increase for distribution this quarter is clearly a positive. But even more positive is how the distribution looks relative to tax flow income. We think this measure is important, more important than the absolute number since taxable income, not distribution is what our shareholders pay tax on. Year-to-date, our total taxable income is running lower than last year. Our per share taxable income is further reduced because it’s spread across 15% more common shares than last year since we used common shares to retire our 7.5% convertible notes during the first quarter. Despite this, our years-to-date per share distributions has increased. So all else being equal, long-term shareholders should be on track this year to keep more of their distributions than the tax they will pay when they receive our K-1s. In terms of our corporate structure, as you know we are a PTP or publicly traded partnership. This provides the benefit of a single layer of taxation similar to what according to REITs and BDCs but without compromising our flexibility, the way those structures would by restricting our holdings, leverage and capital retention. The trade-off is that our shareholders do get K-1s. We know this adds complexity to people’s personal taxes compared to 1099. However, we do want to maintain a single layer of taxation and our business model flexibility in a structure without K-1s. However, there is no readily available alternative that accomplishes first. So given our strategy today, which pave the way out, we do still think this is the best structure for us. And with that, I’m going to hand it to Craig.
Craig Farr: Thanks, Mike. I talked about the quarter of the way we perceive to be keeping strengths, as I took over to CEO soon. And to begin with, we have extremely long live liabilities and no mark-to-market value including our revolver, so we have an enviable capital structure as starting point. We also have a stellar portfolio of assets as you heard from Mike. Having spent some time in the business, I feel comfortable with the diversification in the risk profile of the assets at the funding structure. My job from here is to see here, how we deliver upside in the phase of the amortizing CLO you see in some of our results and the overall yield compression we see across all asset classes today. We spent a lot of time thinking about that and it’s a very dynamic environment. In the process, we have spoken too many of you about a few key things. First, we clearly need to be growing our cash earnings not just overall but per share, that seems to be challenging in the interest rate environment and legacy CLOs amortizing is how meaningful they are to our earnings and cash flow. Second, I hear from a lot of your stories, starting too complicated to be diversified. But if that’s just a network, we would like to see a narrow set of core asset strategies in order to having a easier time involving earnings part of business. And finally, as Mike alluded to their complexities surrounding corporate structure, for example K-1s. It’s clear to me that to get value in the market for KFN and KKR’s key strength, we need to address these points. For using the feedback to adjust accordingly, we are going to increase our capital deployments to more cash building strategies in order to deliver on this growing cash EPS. We are going to narrow our new capital commitments to three main strategies instead of six, which should simplify the story over time and hope to get more recognitions in the market. And we really do our best to evolve the business to minimize additional complexities from a corporate structure and tax status. We’ll clearly continue to refine our strategy in these coming quarters, but at this point the three areas we are focused on for new capital commitments are CLO equity, opportunistic credits and then a new, a related area, specialty financed lending. We feel confident we can find attractive return on equity opportunities in these areas because they are and we think they will be less successful by others. We’ll start to see our reporting perform to these strategies in the coming quarters. CLO, as you know have historically been KFN’s bread and butter. They generate cash starting very soon after issuance and they are easier to model and understand. These are assets that held up very well even during financial crisis. And when I sit back and we are looking at the business and we look at the risk adjusted returns on CLO equity versus other areas today and it’s a still a very attractive asset class, with low to mid-teen returns to the equity for KFN shareholders. And the term non-recourse funding is also very appealing in this market. So we are committing to be more active as a participant in the CLO market, both in U.S. and in Europe where KKR just acquired additional CLO management capabilities by agreeing to purchase Avoca Capital last week. We think global risk retention growth that gives us a chance to more share in the space, a smaller participants from the new regulations to capital incentives. The second area, opportunistic credit will include our current mezzanine and special situation strategies, as we’ve talked about this is one place where we may have to avoid to agree a yield compression you see in liquid market. It’s also a strategy that works well given KKR’s strong direct sourcing capabilities, bringing and filling a premium by participating in the [unique] liquid long duration opportunity. And finally, specialty lending. With the new IFRS, one I’m very exciting about, as we’ve discussed there has been a pullback among traditional lenders against the long duration high residual value assets since the crisis, especially European banks. We think that presents a real opportunity for KFN. In KKR’s network, we can find experienced teams in areas of high bearing entries and we can partner with them to lend against physical assets that generate the cash yields and give down debt protections. We’ve already seen several of these situations and executed in one of them, the Maritime Finance transactions Mike described. Outside of these areas, we don’t expect to commit incremental capital to other strategies beyond some of our existing commitments to natural resources and real estate unless we see in a specially differentiated situation. That’s should leave us with more cohesive and narrow business model, more natural comp sets than the market analyze over time. Finally, we encouraged your views in our partnerships structure related in K-1 and tax treatments. We’ll continue to look for good ways to address those issues, so we can do it in a way that complements our strategy and a net return for all the issues is positive. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of how we see the business today. While, our third quarter results are clearly disappointing and below our expected run rate earnings, we feel confident we can position KFN for recording growth in the upcoming years and I’m pleased our Board has supported that view by raising our distribution this quarter. Thanks for joining us this evening. We are happy to take any questions you have.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instruction) And our first question in queue will come from the line of John Hecht with Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
John Hecht - Stephens: Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple kind of household kind of questions for the model. First is, do you guys have the -- either the sure value or economic book value versus the recently reported GAAP book value?
Craig Farr: We -- not handy, John.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay.
Craig Farr: But we can just close that.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay. Next, so I guess -- when I’ll call you on matters you get better in the next few moments you can provide us, it’s not that important. And the second question you have it is, what was the discount accretion in the quarter? Do you have that handy?
Craig Farr: Discount accretion from prepayments was pretty anemic at about a $1 million.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay.
Craig Farr: That compares to $12 million from last quarter.
John Hecht - Stephens: Yeah. Okay. Moving on to more kind of strategic questions. You guys had a lot of deployment in the quarter, sorry?
Craig Farr: I’m going to interrupt you. Assume you’ve -- fair value over corporate GAAP holdings, adjusted book value would be $10.70 per share.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. Okay. In terms of the deployment in the quarter, you mentioned your asset by asset but can you discuss the timing was just kind of balanced throughout the quarter? Was it late in the quarter? I’m trying to just assess for what run rate earnings might be including the full quarter of performance of the new deployment.
Craig Farr: Sure. The $75 million, we contributed to CLO 2011-1, which we up sided by $300 million. That was done in the last day of the quarter. So there’s no impact on the quarter, just last quarter from that when you see it going forward as we ramped. The Maritime deal, which we funded at $84 million of our $115 million commitments to, we talked about, that’s going to ramp up over the next year. And once that portfolio kind of hits this run rate, we would expect later ‘14 or early’15, it will start to begin generating or returning dividends to us, which we hope is not mid-teens range. On the natural resources and commercial real estate front, those were done -- in fact throughout the quarter. But as you know, John, those have little bit mortgage acre for fast run and delay when we start receiving the benefit of income and cash flows.
John Hecht - Stephens: And then, you guys -- it sounds like you are going to deemphasize other your remaining commitments, deemphasize natural resources. You are considering the commitments and the cash flows and I guess in-ground resources and so forth. When would we see the peak cash flows and when would those start to kind of tail off or amortize, just with the right type of data we should be thinking about?
Craig Farr: So on the natural resources, John, you will probably see that mid next year. On the commercial real estate side, as we mentioned in our remarks that we expect to see that where we kind of starting and had more of a recurring basis in early ‘15 with the pickup the second half of ’14.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay. And to be clear, you would expect that the peak of the natural resources portfolio middle of the next year then that would start to decrease over time.
Craig Farr: Overtime. Correct.
John Hecht - Stephens: Okay. Appreciate that. Very much. Thanks guys.
Craig Farr: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity. I just had a couple of questions trying to figure out this bank loan and high-yield strategy. The performance quarter-over-quarter, excluding other income, it looks like revenue or income is down about $17 million. I’m just trying to get a handle on, is the $11 million you were talking about in the prepay income that didn’t come true this quarter part of that $17 million and the accretion to delta or how should I think about that $17 million decline considering that the portfolio balance is up quarter-over-quarter?
Mike McFerran: Daniel, $11 million is part of that. So that’s the key component, which is, one, you have seen the portfolio turnover over time. And the actual portfolio spreads is tightened but what’s most noteworthy is we saw $666 million of prepayments in the second quarter and a little over $100 million this quarter. So that’s 80% drop. So this is the lowest level we’ve seen in quite some time as a result of that level of prepayment is pretty anemic on $1 million. So that would be the driver of that decline we’re referring to.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay. And so I guess, looking forward, I mean, the tenure come in this quarter so arguably there is more prepayment activity but in a rising rate are consistently moving higher environment. I mean, is the right way to approach this to back out $11 million or there whatever the ratio happens to be between assets in that prepayment income on a go-forward basis if investors are assuming rates are going up or -- how do you I think about that. I mean, was this $11 million or thereabout pretty consistent in the past and at a rising rate environment, does that come out moving forward?
Mike McFerran: It’s a great question. Over the last couple of years, that number is varied anywhere, let’s say, $5 million to $12 million on average. So I would definitely not ignore it. If I look at the recent portfolio today, you’ve got $100 million difference between par and cost basis of the assets that needs to be accreted in on a portfolio where leverage loan, you’d assume the average life for them is four years. So if I do that math, obviously straight line, that’s going to be $25 million a year or about $6 million a quarter which would not be too different that kind of a historical norm for us, really independent rates because the fact that loans usually aren’t accompanied by a prepayment penalty, they still get paid off.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay. I got you. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. And then I think -- another question, when you think about the CLO de-leveraging, if you look that there is a chart you put in here, the figure, Page 13 where you kind of show the current quarter cash receipts, the interest receipts is like a 3-ish million dollar change there. Is that the way -- is that the best way to kind of track from a higher level of the de-leveraging effect that’s going on in the vintage -- in the CLO book?
Mike McFerran: Yes. I mean, that -- the cash is obviously driven by two things. But the CLOs are amortizing. Clearly, the biggest volume is going to be amortization and for the other deals that are in reinvestment especially whether they are reinvesting into a wider or tightening spread in items of another variable. But when I look at 2005, 2006 deals and 2007, 2008 which are all amortizing that’s the best indication of seeing that drop-off.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you. And then finally, one other higher level question. So if we assume rates are moving higher, prepays are slow and so on one hand, you are not going to be getting that prepay income on the revenue side but on the other, couldn’t you argue that the CLOs were de-levered more slowly because the principal payments would be coming in more slowly because of higher rates.
Mike McFerran: Great observation. Completely agree that -- if I had to pick which one we prefer, we’ll take the slower prepayments and extending the life to our legacy deals.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Understood. Thank you for the responses.
Mike McFerran: Absolutely.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Joel Houck with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Joel Houck - Wells Fargo: Thanks, and good afternoon. One of you guys could maybe talk about the -- perhaps the inflection point is in interest income, I mean, you guys deployed capital this quarter, corporate loans went up about 9% but interest income went down, I guess, largely due to amortization. Can you talk about how we should think about the inflection point in terms of the capital being deployed in the future versus kind of slowdown in prepayments?
Mike McFerran: I think you hit it on. There is going to be a balance of us putting capital to ramping up, the new capital we’ve contributed to CLOs like level 1, ramping up future CLOs which as Craig mentioned is a key focus for us and the pace of amortization with your deal. I like to think we’re currently around that inflection point today. However, the target is to time that perfectly. If I were to look ahead, I would expect run rate on that portfolio to start increase over time.
Joel Houck - Wells Fargo: Okay. This certainly should be favorable metric in 2014. Is that fair?
Mike McFerran: That considerably be our objective.
Joel Houck - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then I guess, the second question is maybe talk about the types of returns you are expecting in the maritime finance strategy?
Craig Farr: Yes. Joel, I can talk. This is Craig. I think the -- what we’re seeing there is the management team is able to put out loans at -- on LTV basis, about 65% loan-to-value and cash yield anywhere from 10% to 12% on an un-levered basis. And then we do believe as we accumulate that portfolio, we’re going to attract portfolio-based leverage against the advancing company and it could generate returns on a levered basis from the high teens.
Joel Houck - Wells Fargo: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Craig Farr: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your question please.
Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Just kind of high level question in terms of returns, as you move from kind of a long tail, maybe more residual type of investments particularly of a high return to more current cash type of investments. Did your -- you're seeing return bogeys, I think 10-year charge close to 1000 basis cost. Did that change at all with the new kind of investment mix?
Craig Farr: I think it’s a great question. I think it’s -- I think the (inaudible) we’re going to balance those two things that we are shifting today and may have been a little more aggressive on CLO activity and try to get that cash yield up in the near term. That’s still very attractive return, still place some of that on a more detailed opportunities like, especially finance side. But yes I do think maybe you come down a little bit onto your point on that overall expectation and a 2.5% rate environment given the yield compression keep us at 1000, that’s probably a big expectation in cash yield in this environment. That doesn’t mean again your five-year period is not reasonable. But I think -- I think in this environment what you’re hearing from us is we are going to focus on growing our cash distribution which may put a little pressure on that total return.
Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question on the phone queue will come from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Let me first apologize. I have been in a meeting. So I just walked out. I did not hear about 98% of your formal presentation. So I apologize if anything is redundant. But just have a series of questions, if you back out the non-recurring earnings -- the non-recurring charges, what was the ex run rate of earnings in the quarter back at unusual items. Again, I apologize you may have covered all this, but I have a series of questions that all are linked?
Mike McFerran: It was $0.18, Lee.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: So the non-recurring was only $0.02 but you reported $0.16?
Mike McFerran: Yes.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. So if I take $0.18, I multiply that by 4, you would have run rate of earnings of $0.72.
Craig Farr: Based on net quarterly that’s correct. I think as Mike mentioned, we put in more capital pretty in the quarter that -- which should help grow that over the upcoming quarter that wouldn’t really inflate at this point. And then we had the loan loss provision and some of the amortization discount that was unusually low this quarter.
Mike McFerran: Lee, to add on to Craig’s point. If you look at our cash on hand at quarter end, the amount of capital that’s kind of falling, we’ll call it a J-curve earnings effect being deployed. We are not yet provided earnings contribution. Our total amount is about $600 million.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: $600 million that was unemployed at the end of this quarter or the prior quarter?
Mike McFerran: $600 million of cash as well as capital that’s already been deployed but for which -- the time lag on the period will actually start earning income from it. So a good amount of our capital is actually not providing earnings contribution today, that’s $600 million.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Right. So if I put a 10% return on $600 million, would that be reasonable?
Craig Farr: I think that would be reasonable.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: You said $60 million and again I didn’t even read the release, what’s the share count now, 200 and something shares?
Craig Farr: Yes. 204 million. 
Mike McFerran: That would be called an extra $7.5 a quarter.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. And so, okay, and then something I said, I think, to is contraindicated, you said that you wanted to grow the distribution which would put pressure on your spreads, why is that?
Craig Farr: Yes. I think the question was when you think of total returns versus cash, I think -- what we are saying is with the CLO equity we -- and now we have deployed today natural resources in real estates, those maybe higher total return strategies but we are -- got to shift a little more into higher cash yielding strategy to ensure that we have the adequate cash flow for dividend growth.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: I got it. So basically, if you put the $600 million to work, looking at year from now, assuming no other profits crop up, you are like dollar-to-dollar slide kind of earner which would basically be a 10% or little bit less on GAAP book value -- the 10% ROE business? Is that fair?
Mike McFerran: Your math is very reasonable, Lee.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. So I think this is a little bit less ambitious than we have been, so 10% ROE we generate earnings a little over dollar. You bump the dividend to $0.88 rate. So you are only retaining a very modest amount. Let’s say you are returning -- retain 20% of your earnings on a 10% ROE, so you could finance the growth rate a couple of percent?
Mike McFerran: While the other aspect, Lee, is there are a couple of things. One, our leverage is under 0.3 times. So frankly with our credit ratings, the debt capital markets are still available to us. But if we rate -- our average borrowing rate today is a little over 7%. So assuming we put a lot of more money, something above 7%, this could be accretive to both cash and income.
Craig Farr: Yes. We certainly have the strategy -- capital on the ground with higher expectations obviously than a 10% return whether it’s some of the natural resources, some of the real estate cash or even some of your Maritime Finance that I just went through. So I do think there is -- there is -- we see the growth profile as Mike mentioned some of that capital may take time to like into do that -- that return profile.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. And I know that the Board probably were very low to be in a position to cut the dividend again. We went through that period in ‘08, ‘09 et cetera. So I assume that the dividend of $0.88 you guys secured based upon the business outlook as you see it?
Craig Farr: Lee, we want to speak for the board but they clearly made that statement and wouldn’t -- wouldn’t be raising the dividend, they didn’t have that deal of choice.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: So just using round numbers, an $0.88 dividend and divide that by -- do that by 11, let’s say, just being optimist. That’s an 8% return and maybe you get 2% to 3% growth and so it’s 10% to 11% return vehicle in a world of zero sure rate and 2.5% 10-year government, something like that?
Craig Farr: I think that’s certainly I look at it and I think to get your point. You have to look at the risk profile. I think we are still very good about the downside protection in diversification and zero point when you look at relatively risk rewards, it makes down but it’s not a huge return, but I actually think in this environment it’s such a very reasonable expectation.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much. I think that’s all I had. Okay. Thank you very much. Again, I am sorry, I missed the call by. I will listen to the replay. 
Mike McFerran: Thanks Lee.
Craig Farr: Yes. Thanks Lee. Thanks for coming.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) At this time, I’m showing no additional questions in the phone queue at this time.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference may be recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Pam Testani. Please go ahead.
Pam Testani: Thank you, [Hughie]. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings call. I’m joined by Bill Sonneborn, our CEO, Mike McFerran, our COO and CFO and Craig Farr our President and CEO elect. We’d like to remind everyone that we’ll be discussing forward-looking statements based on management’s beliefs on today’s call. These don’t guarantee future events or performance and are subject to substantial risks that are described in greater detail both in our SEC filings and in the supplemental information presentation posted to our website. Actual results may vary materially from today’s statements. We’ll also be referencing non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in the supplement. I’ll start with some quick second quarter highlights and then turn it to Mike to go over our results and Bill will then discuss the environment and his decision to retire and then Craig will wrap things up for us. Today, we reported second quarter net income available to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.39 per diluted common share. This compares to $92 million or $0.46 per diluted common share for the first quarter. We generated a 15% return on equity in Q2 making this the seventh consecutive quarter that we’ve been able to deliver returns in excess of our target of treasury by 2000 basis points. Our book value per common share increased to $10.41 at June 30 from $10.16 as of March 31. In connection with this quarter’s earnings, today our board of directors declared a cash distribution of $0.21 per common share. The distribution is payable on August 20 to common shareholders of record as of August 6. And I’ll now pass things to Mike.
Michael Robert McFerran: Thanks, Pam and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Overall, we had a strong quarter generating a 15% return on equity, consistent with our last several quarters; our results were significantly driven by gains on investments both realized and unrealized. We did see some topline revenue compression, though not unexpectedly as four of our pre-priced CLOs are out of their reinvestment periods and currently amortizing. However, we’re beginning to see those offset by capital deployed to more recent CLOs and to our national resources and commercial real estate strategies. As Pam mentioned, our second quarter net income available to common shareholders was $79 million. This consisted of $137 million of total revenues, $65 million of total investment costs, $37 million of other income and $23 million of other expenses. Total revenues decreased 2% from the first quarter; this was driven by $7 million decline in the second quarter interest income, primarily due to amortization of those pre-priced of CLOs. The decline in interest income was partially offset by $4 million quarter-over-quarter increased in oil and gas revenue. The growth in our oil and gas revenue is driven by recent deployment we have made primarily to our drilling strategy where we have now made investments over $200 million. Total investment cost declined by $16 million from $81 million for the first quarter to $65 million for the second quarter. The decline was driven by having no incremental provision for loan losses in the second quarter after taking a $11 million provision for the first quarter. We also had a $4 million charge in the first quarter relating into our retirement of our 7.5% converts now it’s a one-time charge. Other income for the second quarter totaled $37 million, which included $25 million of realized and unrealized gains from investments during the quarter. This was down from $74 million for the first quarter, which have included $95 million of gains offset by a $20 million charge relates to the conversion of our 7.5% then outstanding convertible notes. As we’ve mentioned over the last few quarters, other income will be highly variable because it’s driven by episodic sales and mark-to-market. With respect to our portfolio, I do want to highlight that after quarter-end, Cengage Learning formerly known as TL Acquisitions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We hold a $169 million par amount of their outstanding senior secured term loan and $70 million par amount of their 11.5% secured bonds through 2020, largely through our CLO subsidiaries. In addition, as we anticipate to the likelihood of restructuring, we do accumulate $15 million of their term loan and $15 million of these bonds through our special situation strategy over the months leading up to the time that they filed. While we believe we are adequately reserved against the downside, we continue to think that there are potential upside opportunities from here which is why we’ve been increasing our position. In terms of cash earnings for the second quarter, we generated $0.23 of run rate per common share or a 9% annualized cash return on equity. Total cash earnings, which includes cash gains was $0.31 per common share reflecting a 12% cash return on equity. We ended the quarter with book value per common share of $10.41, an increase of over 2% per share since March 31. And our distribution as Pam mentioned is $0.21 per common share, this is in line with the last four quarters. It’s really important to note that this distribution relates to a share count that has increased 26.1 million shares or 15% since year end. So even though the distribution is constant, we’re paying a larger amount of cash out to our shareholders at the same time, our taxable income is being spread across more shares. Next, I want to spend a minute in our interest rate exposure, which I know many of you are focused on in the current environment. From a capital structure perspective, we are primarily fund with fixed rate long-term debt and perpetual preferred equity. We’ve locked in funding at a weighted average per tax cost of less than 8% and less than 7% exclude our perpetual preferred shares. That will become even more valuable if and as the percipience, especially since we have no maturities for 23 years unless we’ve drawn our revolver. On only recourse debt that is not fixed rate is $125 million of floating rates trust preferred securities with the rate base on three months LIBOR. As you may recall about two years ago, we swapped the floating to fixed rate payment through their maturity. Also none of our recourse debt including our revolver is contingent on the market value of collateral assets. So as changing rate expectations moves after prices, we can take advantage of widening spreads and decreasing prices by buying the assets with capital that’s inflated to net volatility. On the asset side we believe our aggregate portfolio should be well positioned if we see substantial increases and long or short-term rates or both. On the short-end, we’re $1.4 billion net long LIBOR through our corporate debt holdings. If LIBOR increases materially so do our earnings. LIBOR stays low, we’re nowhere soft. The way we get squeezed is to an increase of LIBOR about 225 basis points or less since we have LIBOR floors in the majority of our debt holdings today; we’ve quantified this on Page 26 of our earnings supplement. Our leverage to longer end of the curve is not as easy to quantify, but rising long-term rates or steepening curve are the reasons why we’ve been accumulating a real asset portfolio, commodity prices and real asset income have historically correlated with long-term rates. Now I'm going to hand this over to Bill to review our strategy performance during the quarter.
William C. Sonneborn: Thank you, Mike. For the last several quarters, we’ve talked to you about our sizable cash position. We’ve held this to anticipating increased market volatility and as we’ve discussed last quarter, higher long-term interest rates in the near-term. We have begun to witness that, thanks to recent Fed comments alluding to unwinding of QE3 later this year. The average loan price in the LST index fell almost a point in June, which was the first month in the red for the loan index since believe it or not May 2012, high yield bond yields moved from all-time lows near 5.5% its over 7% in just a matter of weeks from the interest rate fears, and a tenure yield almost 275 basis points at one point during the quarter. Despite that back drop, we generated a 15% return on equity. That means that nine out of the last 10 quarters, we’ve achieved our objective of generating returns on capital greater than our target, including as Pam mentioned the past seven quarters straight. As we’ve stated previously, we’ve been focused on building a business that can produce returns for shareholders, regardless of short-term volatility. Now let’s look at each strategy, starting with financial assets. In bank loans and high yield we generated a 18% run rate and a 26% total ROE for the second quarter. We mentioned last quarter that we’re being patient on timing for launch of a new CLO. By waiting until this quarter, we are able to price a new CLO 2013-1 near post crisis tights for liability spreads. The interest rate shock that hit fixed-income markets soon after allowed us to accumulate loans at more attractive levels than we actually had originally modeled. The new CLO was initially modeled to be more than our treasury’s plus at 1000 return target, but the step back in loan prices enabled us to add about 200 basis points of projected return on equity, as a result of a better arbitrage in the initial portfolio ramp.  Looking ahead, we think CLOs will continue to be an attractive source of less interest rate sensitive mid-teens returns and we think KFN is especially well positioned in that space. As a result of recently announced risk retention rules in Europe, many traditional European buyers at CLO rated notes have been put on the sidelines. For KFN new strategy involves retaining the risk piece of its CLOs complying with the guidelines is achievable. We believe most of the CLO managers will have a more difficult time complying with such rules. We believe our latest deal met all the latest retention rules. We’re hopeful we can replicate that structure to do deals that European institutions can and want to buy. As shown in our supplement our mezzanine in special situation strategies generated very strong returns during the quarter. In mezz, we generated a 25% run rate and 34% total ROE in Q2 and in special situations, we had a 17% run rate and a 36% total ROE, with a 21% IRR since we began investing in the strategy several years ago. The recent disruption in the high yield markets could be a good thing for proprietary debt opportunities such as these. In the last few quarters, we’ve talked about how regulation and deleveraging in the banking sector have created opportunities for us over the past five years. One of those opportunities is maritime lending. European banks have historically been the dominant lenders to the maritime industry, following the financial crisis these same European banks are now stacked with massive stressed or impaired loan portfolios. As a result, virtually all of the leading lenders to buyers of maritime assets, let new build offshore oil rigs in ships are either substantially scaling back their activity or exiting the space altogether. This pull-back coincides with the material need for capital to finance new maritime assets coming online have been built over the last couple of years are available for delivery. For example, E&P companies have expanded their deepwater CapEx budgets, which will increase demand for the most advanced assets being made today, but there are a decreasing number of vendors moving to help finance those rigs and other vessels, those folks need. This is a classic supply and demand imbalance we’ve loved. And we hope to be in a position to discuss the related transaction with you soon. Moving on from financial assets to real assets, in natural resources, we generated a 14% run rate and a 29% total ROE for the quarter. Development continues to be the most active area of deployment in our natural resources strategy today. In recent years, independent E&P companies have gone through a land grab for unconventional properties, now they have substantial acreage but little cash to develop it, since most of these companies are either small levered public companies or private companies backed by small sponsors, before the Street will give them credit for the acreage, traditional banks will lend against it, it needs to be producing that’s where our capital can help and we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy. Finally in commercial real estate, we generated a 4% run rate loss and a 3% total loss on equity for the quarter, largely because the strategy is burdened by overhead without having material income yet. We committed to one new real estate deal in Q2 a 430,000 square foot portfolio of UK Retail Park Properties, as with other deals we’ve done our investment is centered on operational improvements for example, leasing up vacant space, reconfiguring elements of the properties and alike.  The transaction closed at mid July. The outlook from where we sit today has gotten more interesting since the end of Q1, for a few reasons. First, the Fed has introduced some uncertainty in the world. From a buyers perspective that’s a good thing for several of our strategies, especially relative to where things were earlier this year. In many instances, risk is being more appropriately priced and rates were becoming more real. Second, assuming uncertainty results in asset price declines we’re equipped to act. We have a strong cash position and capacity to increase it with revolver whose size is not contingent on asset prices, so we can be opportunistic when things get choppy. And finally, much of the uncertainty relates to interest rates. We think our positioning in a rising rate environment is unusually strong as Mike went through for a financial services company. Now I want to conclude with few things. First I want to address my decisions to retire from KFN and depart KKR. And second I’d like to introduce the new CEO elect Craig Farr. I’ve had an amazing experience during my tenure at KFN and KKR; I have worked with incredible team of unbelievably talented individuals. I have received thoughtful guidance from a brilliant Board of Directors and wonderful ideas and suggestions from you our shareholders and analyst. I'm very proud of all that we have accomplished together. And I have never felt better about where the business stands and its opportunities to thrive going forward. When I first was named CEO I promised you all during a conference call, I would do everything I could to maximize shareholder value. Back in March of this year, I read the latest in a number of steadies this one by University of Texas professor focused on trying to determine optimal CEO tenure as it relates to creating maximum shareholder value. The ultimate conclusion of the paper is that the optimal tenure for a CEO is just under five years. It appears that around this time, the value of continuity may start to become outweighed by the fresh look benefit of change in innovation that can be brought by a new leader. As of today, I have been CEO of KFN for just under five years, and if I’m true to my word, I’m doing everything I can to maximize shareholder value. It’s an optimal time for me to make a change.  Orson Welles once said if you want a happy ending you need to know when to end your story. As I end mine with KFN, I’m glad to be leaving you in the capable hands of my friend and partner Craig Farr. Craig joined KKR in 2006 to create a capital markets business within the firm after 12 years at Citigroup, where he had roles including co-head of North American Equity Capital Markets and head of U.S. Convertible and Corporate Equity Derivative Origination. I’ve worked alongside him for five years and I’ve seen him build our Capital Markets effort from scratch into a successful global endeavor that over the last two fiscal years has contributed around. 30% of KKR’s fee related earnings. I’ve witnessed his leadership, his intelligence and creativity drive a tremendous amount of value. I know KFN will benefit from his diverse skills and fresh look. I’m going to spend the next few months helping Craig transition into his new role, before I move on to my next challenge. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Craig Farr.
Craig J. Farr: Thanks, Bill. Well I'm new to having formal responsibility to the Company, I've been close to KFN since its IPO; I have had the pleasure of working closely with Bill, and Mike over the years since I joined KKR. And as my role at the firm has evolved, I’ve overseen certain of our credit strategies, so I've also spent a lot of time with some of the teams that invest KFN capital. I'm looking forward to be more directly involved with the company, and working with all of you in the coming years. Before we open up for questions, there are three subjects I’d like to cover. First, I’d like to share some reflections on Bill. Second, on KFN’s current positioning and finally on my near-term objective as CEO. With regard to Bill, how would I thank him for giving me such a strong starting point. When he took the reins at KFN, the situation was very different, the company faced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and KFN's shares were trading around $0.75. Bill's calm leadership, long-term focus and commitment to protecting shareholder value, not only navigated KFN through the crisis, but to a current position of stability and strength for Bill on behalf of KFN’s stakeholders, thank you for your contribution over the past five years. Today, I’m here at the Company with a capital structure that’s enviable for a specialty finance business. KFN has a sizable cash position, an undrawn credit facility, no mark-to-market liabilities, and no recourse debt maturities for over two decades, to put it simply, we have a very strong foundation for future prosperity. Over the next few months, I’ll be working closely with Mike, our team at KKR and our Board of Directors to view KFN strategic positioning, corporate structure in a plan for future growth. Bill will be serving as a Senior Adviser at KKR upon his departure. So I'll also have his continued benefit of his perspective and guidance. Finally I plan to use this time to get acquainted with many of you, with your input and support, Mike and I look forward to building on Bill's success, increasing the value of KFN on behalf of all its shareholders.
Michael Robert McFerran: Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, if you want to open the call for questions.
Operator:  Sure, thanks. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Daniel – our first question will come from Charles Miller. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, gentlemen thanks for taking my questions. With regards to the revenue mix, presuming we’ve continue to see a shift of the amortization within the credit strategy and redeployment in other strategies. How should we think about that mix going forward?
Michael Robert McFerran: That’s a great question, Charles. The one strategy that you haven't seen any revenue contribution yet – deploying capital, two is commercial real estate, so I expect in the coming quarters and especially as we enter 2014, that to also start making a more modest reasonable revenue contribution. The credit strategies while we have the legacy CLO amortizing, as we mentioned at the end of then of the last year we had closed CLO 2012-1 and at the end of the second quarter we closed CLO 2013-1. So you are going to beginning to see some credit to actual revenue offset the amortization the old CLOs. And with respect to natural resources while we’re continuing to see that growth it's also going to be a function of revenue deployment and timing of cash flows. All in all, I think in the future if I were to fast-forward a few quarters based on how we’ve committed and deployed revenues to date, we continue to see some diversification, but again I think we will be starting to level off with the CLOs wrapping up.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great thank you. And just as a follow-up, how should we think of the pipeline and the outlook of the commercial real estate strategy looking beyond your current commitments?
Michael Robert McFerran: We’ve been pretty active over the last two quarters on that strategy. I think the pipeline remains robust, we’re continuing to look in new opportunities as you can appreciate the lead time from first looking at opportunity to actually making the investment decision to funding it can sometimes be longer compared to our credit decision to buy or a traded asset where its almost immediate, but I think the pipeline remains robust, we expect the capital allocated in that strategy to continue to grow.
William C. Sonneborn:  And one aspect just to add to that is as a result of kind of some of the original real estate investments now kind of starting to hit maturity in terms of having them in the portfolio, we’re going to start seeing over the next couple of quarters outpacing substantial income produced and return produced on those investments as they mature.
Unidentified Analyst: Great I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you sir. Our next question will come from with Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. Bill, let me first congratulate you. You’ve done a terrific job, a little bit of a tailwind helping you out. But I think you should upgrade the quality of literature you're reading because I don't know many great CEOs that have done it in five years and you cannot look no further than your own firm, I don’t know how long Henry and George have been around, but certainly more than five years and et cetera but anyway, let's not dwell on that. I envy you, I’m still doing it at 70 and you’re going on your next challenge at 43. So I was disappointed in the absence of the dividend action and I’m wondering what statement – I have four or five questions as usually the case maybe I'll get them all out write them down and you can tackle them one at a time. What statement is the Board making by not raising the dividend if the four consecutive quarters of $0.21? Second, how much unemployed capital is on the balance sheet earning essentially zero? In other words if you got all the capital, if you reduce your cash to what your minimum operating cash was, how much additional loan could you make and what was a traditional lending rate that you are lending at these days? And then thirdly, I'm a little confused by a statement in your release which I don't think is correct, it says total other expenses of $23.2 million for the quarter of 2013 reflected an increase of $18.6 million during the comparable period, your prior-year-period primarily due to a higher level of related party management compensation largely resulting from issuance of the companies (inaudible) perpetual referred. What does it have to do with management compensation, maybe you can elaborate on that and then finally on the Cengage you have a $186 million of – you say properly reserved, but you wouldn’t buy more because you think there is an opportunity to create value, you can elaborate on that a little bit so these would be my initial questions?
William C. Sonneborn: Sure. I'll take the first one in the context of the statement of the board and the distribution. As we’ve talked about in previous calls the Board meets quarterly to review the distribution anyone quarter and process of doing that takes into account a number of factors and circumstances of perspective to the company. And while it is certainly historically it appears over the last two years that right around now the Board has made a decision to increase the distribution as you note that’s not the case this July. But also instant in this particular point is this issue of transition of leadership. And so I think that’s also a factor of that the Board took in above beyond traditional factors and setting the distribution for this quarter. And so that’s basically hopefully answering your question.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: Not really, it is different.
Michael Robert McFerran: The second aspect is what Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, which is when you look at the portion of our run rate, we’re kind of operating what we earn on Saturday and Sundays cash that we are sending out as a result the $26 million shares, we issued to take out the converts, it’s gone up and in addition, we’re spreading taxable income now around 15% more shares, so taxable income per share would decline by 15% on an apples-to-apples basis.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: I know.
William C. Sonneborn: But the more share should bring in more capital and the firm, which brings in more earning power. The stock started the year $10.51; the S&P is up 19%. The stock is at probably getting this on way. It is clear that the income distribution to the shareholders of measure with the share can capitalize. It’s not a vehicle that people are kind of embracing with this greatest enthusiasm. We could talk about the stock rising for $0.75 it actually went public at $0.24. So it’s $0.24 to $10.05 or whatever, we are at $11 unchanged. So I think that the investors looking at a dividend some measure of management’s view of the ongoing earning power, the current nature of the earning power. So I guess we’re looking at is your 12% cash return that was $0.31, so we’re paying at 68% of cash earnings, retaining 32% and probably retaining on the balance sheet that is probably overcapitalized. So let’s get to the second question. How much unemployed capital do you have at the present time, if we look at the $507 million of cash and cash equivalents, what would be your minimum cash requirements to run the business?
Michael Robert McFerran: Well, Lee, this is Mike. As far as minimum cash requirements, I’ll work backwards in the question. As far as minimum cash requirements to run the business, they’re deminimis because we have unfunded – undrawn revolver that has no borrowing base attached to us. So we feel very pretty comfortable actually running the business on minimal cash flow. So we think about our cash number, we’re comfortable effectively speaking for that amount. As we mentioned the balance sheet, we have over $500 million free cash at quarter end. The majority of that amount is actually earmarked to either deals that we’ve already made commitments too to which we’re actually funding at the moment through natural resources or commercial real estate or dealers that we’ve earmarked, but we haven’t actually signed commitments around yet, but we think are in later stage of completion.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: It’s not earning – but it’s not earning any return?
Michael Robert McFerran: Exactly.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: So is it reasonable to assume the stake a number – round numbers easy that $500 million or to be returning net as before loan loss provisioning of 10 points or $15 million sometime in next year or so?
Michael Robert McFerran: Our goal has always been treasuries plus 1,000, so that would imply although higher than your 10 points Lee.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: So that remain at somewhere out in the next year or so that will hopefully pickup $50 million more of income?
Michael Robert McFerran: I think you have from our view Lee, that will be our objective and we expect to have the super majority of this capital that actually out the door.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: That’s why I get back to dividend. If you think you’re going to increment your earnings by $0.25 a share, I think you should have signaled that through the dividend policy, but let’s not be the dead horse.
Michael Robert McFerran: Okay.
William C. Sonneborn: Yeah, I think two are the points you want to flag in relates to earnings and cash flow timing. As you know, we’ll do things like CLOs where you may go through a 90 day ramp up period within three month to four months; you actually are getting ratifying cash to pay debt. But natural resources and commercial real estate strategies is a longer lead time. So to-date we put about $150 million out to commercial real estate and as we mentioned on the call, we expect to start seeing over the next few quarters’ income coming back off that, but that hasn't happened yet. Similarly, in natural resources, we’re starting to see a pickup in income there talking about the J curve effect we have when the time we push the capital out and you go to a period trying to harvest that capital relatively being drilled production increases. We have over $400 million put out to natural resources and again we starting to see revenue growth there. So on a perfect road and things go as we hopeful we will make the investment decisions. We’ll see increased income across the Board not just from commercial real estate natural resources, but also from that undeployed capital. With respect to distributions, I think Bill’s – I echo Bill’s comments also say again this is evaluated on a quarterly basis based on what our cash flows are the forecast based on what we’re seeing at that point?
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: Without revealing your trading strategies, can you talk about you said you were adequately reserved Cengage declared bankruptcy at $186 million of paper plus we have added some together. You're adequately reserved the paper I think the subordinate stuff trade to zero. So could you help us…
William C. Sonneborn: We only hold as Mike and Mike's comments the secured bonds and the senior secured term loan, we own nothing subordinated in the capital structure.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: So you think you have given but your view is without revealing your strategy given with your value, you think you’ll make money here?
William C. Sonneborn: Well, I mean to make it simple, we were actually because of the way we won allowance, so actually we are reserved through what the market price was at quarter end, so to us that’s the GAAP reserving approach, we hoped this upside from there and we’ve expressed that view as to buy more of the paper. But we think we are we are protected to a down side outcome. We though it gonna be worst than where it trades we would be selling it.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: Again Bill, congratulation to you.
William C. Sonneborn: Thank you.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: I don’t know if I’m envious or what, I have to figure it out.
Michael Robert McFerran: Well I don’t, maybe actually be envious of you.
William C. Sonneborn: I don’t know, we’ll see.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors, Inc.: Okay.
Operator:  Thank you sir. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Stephens. please go ahead your line is now open.
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Good afternoon guys, (inaudible) and congratulating you Mick and Craig look forward to meeting you. First question is I think you guys outlined that there was about a $7 million reduction and interest income from the CLO portfolio this quarter. Two questions how should we think about the pace of cash flows, there is ongoing amortization in that in the other set of structures there and beyond just an amortization, is there any other variability of cash flows as these things start to wind down?
Michael Robert McFerran:  Sure. Great question, John. Yeah it’s not only the variability of cash flows but there are a couple of variables. The two actually the three key ones are, first, the pace of prepayments where the CLOs are amortizing, we experienced a pretty accelerated wave of prepayments beginning really in the middle of the first quarter through the beginning of the second quarter. And as Bill had mentioned you saw loans actually trade off in June, which was timed nicely around our new CLO to corresponding to back up and prices, vessel prepayment activity dropped significantly. The second variable is rates as we’re net LIBOR primarily through the CLOs positions, if you would start seeing LIBOR materially pickup but actually have a material impact on the cash flow and income generated from these. Third, I think material we talked about over two and a quarter percent. The third variable is, focusing around our largest CLO, where we have the most capital and we continue reinvestment to May 14, and we’ve begun the process now of two new CLOs of adding to that. So, I think look, you’re going to see, continue to see some tapering of income from the legacy CLOs but as we deploy more capital in new fields, we should start seeing offset.
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: And based on the position you held in the most recent CLO, can you give us sense of what yield once it’s fully ramped and cash flowing, what type of cash flow we’ll get on that one?
Michael Robert McFerran:  As Bill mentioned, we had, when we made the decision of price that deal. We were expecting something in that, what we usually expect in the CLO market around 13%, 14%. We’ve benefited from being able to deploy into over the down market. So, we can be about 200 basis points that so we’re feeling like (inaudible) we look out for 15%.
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Okay, great. You guys have done a very good job outlining your interest rate risk and it just haven’t visited this subjects in a while. Can you discuss if any of mark-to-market risk done in the balance sheet at this point?
Michael Robert McFerran: I mean as mark-to-market risk from P&L and so much as we carry some assets as fair value, there is no real business risk from assets that’s just GAAP earnings, none of the GAAP earnings are important, but it’s not going to impact cash flows, we have no debt tied to our assets. So we could go through for example, the fourth quarter of 2008 to repeat itself, We won’t have to post a dollar of collateral
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Okay. And then the final question I guess is maybe my last time at least in this capacity as Mike, what’s your opinion of the economic trends and going of what are you guys doing strategically to account for that opinion?
Michael Robert McFerran:  And actually John, I’m actually staying with the company. So I’m going to pass it to Bill.
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Oh, gosh I mean I apologize guys.
Michael Robert McFerran: (inaudible).
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: And my brain got messed up there, of course I meant bill, sorry about that.
William C. Sonneborn: No problem John. How are you?
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Good.
William C. Sonneborn:  The answer is we’ve been spending a lot of time over the last couple of years preparing for the environment. We’re starting to move in today, whether that’s fixing the liability structure on the balance sheet long-dated over the two decades worth of time before the nearest maturity with no mark-to-market financing, a strong cash and liquidity position, deploying capital between financial assets and real assets. We feel really good from an economic perspective, particularly domestically here in the U.S. where we actually expect economic activity to pickup in the third and fourth quarters that will spurn quantitative or QE3 easing by the federal reserve coming down from their $85 billion a month to something beginning in the fourth quarter of something in the range of $10 billion to $20 billion less per month, pleasing out over the course of next year. We think higher economic growth in the U.S. will have some impact on inflation expectation. That’s one of the reasons we have long-dated long duration assets on our balance sheet, Europe is muddling along.  We are concerned about the financial system in China and particularly in emerging markets and the export, import data continues to be very poor out of that part of the world. But we’re cautiously optimistic on the environment. The strong U.S. growth will be really good for our credit portfolio from a perspective of low default rates, very well positioned for the equity markets and we have a decent amount of equity market risk on our balance sheet for the first time over the course of the past kind of 18 to 24 months.  So I think the business is pretty much set to perform really well based upon the macroeconomic backdrop that we see.
John Hecht – Stephens Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Sorry for the name mixup.
William C. Sonneborn: Okay, no problem, John.
Operator:  Thank you sir. Our next question will come from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Good afternoon everybody and Bill congratulations and thank you. And Craig, I look forward to working with you in the future as well. And Mike I guess it’s not your five year anniversary, so, we’ll just (Inaudible). So I got a couple of one new one. One I want to kind of hone in on and then second or third one here, and when you talk about the spread, does the anticipated ROE on the CLO 13.1 can I infer that you’re looking at asset yields at about L+ 375 there?
Michael Robert McFerran: Yeah. That sounds right.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And leverage of 7.5 times, it looks like it’s slightly less levered than 12.1 or is that just a miscount on my part?
Michael Robert McFerran: No the miscount, the leverage was somewhere to 12.1 as about 10 times.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay.
Michael Robert McFerran: With 10 times total leverage it was only 88%, as of July 19, it was 88% ramp. So, if you’re looking at the assets or supply base that maybe where you’re off.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Got you. Okay.
Michael Robert McFerran: I wondered ramp will be about 10X.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, perfect. And then this headwinds from the amortization of the pre-crisis deals and I get it that you’re kind of doing this maneuvering here to try to offset that. But assuming a static yield curve, which I know is not a valid assumption, what type of ROE headwind would you assume from those pre-crisis deals?
Michael Robert McFerran: Yeah, look I mean those pre-crisis deals are generating upwards to that 18%, 19% return without taking into account the leverage we deployed capital against them. So those deals as we think can’t be replicated and so much as we benefited from pre-crisis, liability pricing being able to redeploy assets during the crisis and I’ll say being able to benefit from that activity. So I guess – certainly there is a possible we create. The way I think about the balance sheet and how you’ll think about the income going forward is the balance sheet today has been more of a barbell. We’ve done a lot of capital, both in cash and other assets that we deployed capital too but haven’t restarted our generating income yet. At the other end of the barbell, you had those legacy CLOs. As those legacy CLOs are clicking that 18%, 19% return start running off, you should start seeing income increase on the other end of the barbell, so they’ve all started reverting to the mean somewhere in the middle of that plus value level.
William C. Sonneborn:  But just one way to think about it is to answer your question following on Mike’s point is, we just mentioned 2013-1 is a 15% ROE. The legacy were 18% or 19%. So that differential of kind of 400 to 500 basis points phased in over time is likely going to be the drag unless we go through another credit crisis where our liabilities become extraordinarily valuable at the new transactions we’re doing.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Understood, understood, thank you. And then how about turning to strategy for a little bit in terms of I get that – you guys not have a good exposure to the long end of the curve, but the short end, what’s the strategy for any headwinds you’ll face as the short end rises that first 100, 200 basis points. And I’m using the short end as a proxy for LIBOR. I mean is there anything in the near-term, LIBOR obviously hasn’t moved yet. Are you contemplating, putting something on the books that will help to alleviate some of that that first piece of the move will be negative move for your income there? And is there anything that you’re planning today to try to offset some of that?
William C. Sonneborn: No that would be playing fair, I think we are conscious that we will feel a little bit of compression as it starts moving up. That’s our view in the long-term that LIBOR will go past that level, once it starts moving and may not be an overnight shifts. So we might feel that for a couple of quarters. But we don’t think it would be there for an extended period of time. I think once you start see the rates moved and that while it probably won’t move as quickly as the 10 year to last quarter, I think we think start seeing rates move at a reasonably consistent pace. Yes.
Michael Robert McFerran: May not as 1994, but we expect once they go, they start going that’s the historical presence and so to sell upside participation above 2% – 2.25% protect between 1% and 2% of LIBOR seeing that for a long period of time, it’s a pretty expensive insurance policy.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: No, I get it. Okay. Well thanks for the time, everybody.
William C. Sonneborn: Thank you.
Michael Robert McFerran: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Jason Stewart with Compass Point. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jason Stewart – Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Hi, thanks. On the real estate strategy, I mean we’re seeing a lot of larger real estate investors pickup the pace of realizations and sale activity and then it looks like you’re taking a little bit of an opposite approach. Could you talk about what you’re looking at that’s different in the generic opportunity in commercial real estate and maybe your outlook for selling a property if you improve the fundamentals and it make sense, it doesn’t make sense to own it any longer?
Michael Robert McFerran: Yeah, I mean our view of real estate is completely opportunistic, which is buy at a very good value cheap, operationally improve it and enhance it, get it leased up, get the existing lease rates up in terms of rate and then sell it. So we don’t plan on holding properties long-term. We are – we expect to have a weighted average holding period at somewhere between two and four years for each of our investments.
Jason Stewart – Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Okay. And if I could tie that question into Leon’s question earlier. How does that strategy deferred with the dividend policy given that we know it takes something like 18 months to get you to a cash fund rate of earnings? And then if you’re able to realize capital gains to the extent that you would desire to distribute those. Is that something we should consider core down the road or is that something that we should think would be opportunistic?
Michael Robert McFerran:  All right, it’s opportunistic but once these properties are repositioned CapEx is going to back into them. They’re cash flow positive and then it’s just a question of when you make the decision to actually capitalize that cash flow positive stream potentially to a core or a core plus fire, and so that’s a question based upon market conditions what cap rates are available as to when we take advantage of the option to exit but in the meantime once they’re repositioned, they become cash flow positive.
Jason Stewart – Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Okay. One last one even though it’s early on the maritime lending, I’m as far from being expert on this as probably anybody. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what this investment profile looks like in terms of leverage ROE, the size of the opportunity and perhaps your thoughts on how fast it could ramp?
Michael Robert McFerran:  We’re not prepared to go into details yet on it yet but we plan on informing shareholders in due course once something is finalized.
Jason Stewart – Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. And with that, that does conclude our time for questions. I would like to turn the program back over to Bill Sonneborn for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Sonneborn: Thank you, and thank you all for all of your trust and patience over the course of the past five years, I really like to express my thanks to Mike McFerran, Nicole, Jeff Van Horn and all of the team within KKR that support KFN they have continue to do nothing but an outstanding job for many years. And I look forward to helping Craig continue to build lots of shareholder value for you going forward. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Again this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Pam Testani – Head, IR Mike McFerran – CFO and COO Bill Sonneborn – President and CEO
Analysts:  Scott Valentin – FBR Capital Markets Daniel Furtado – Jefferies John Hecht – Stephens Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors 
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to KKR Financial Holdings LLC First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at the time. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now I like to turn the conference over to your host Pam Testani, Head of Relations of KKR, LLC. You may begin.
Pam Testani: Thank you, Mercy. Welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings call. I am joined by Bill Sonneborn our CEO and Mike McFerran our COO and CFO. We’d like to remind everyone that we’ll be discussing forward-looking statements based on management’s beliefs on today’s call, we don’t guarantee future events or performance and they’re subject to substantial risks that are described in greater detail both in our SEC filings and in the supplemental information presentation posted to our website. Actual results may vary materially from today’s statements. We’ll also be referring to non-GAAP measures which are reconciled to GAAP figures in the supplements. I’ll start the call with some first quarter highlights and then Mike will discuss our financial performance and Bill will go over the market backdrop and our strategy activity and performance. So seeing from our earning release that this is the first quarter we’re reporting results that factor in distributions on our main perpetual preferred shares. Now there are two net income lines on our income statement. Net income, which is before preferred distributions that are declared in a given quarter and then net income available to common shareholders which adjusts for the distribution. The later one is what our per share earnings figures are now based on. Today we reported first quarter net income available to common shareholders of $92 million or $0.46 per diluted common share an increase of 19% from last quarter’s net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted for one-time non cash charges of $24 million associated with retiring our 7.5% convert net income available to common shareholders increased 50%. We also generated an 18% return on equity which makes us our sixth consecutive quarter of delivering greater than our target return of 10-year treasury plus the 1000 basis points. Our book value per common share decreased $0.15 or 1% to $10.16 from December to March 31st primarily because our 7.5% convertible notes were converted into $26.1 million common shares during the quarter. In connection with this quarter’s earnings yesterday our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $0.21 per common share. This represents a 95% payout ratio on run rate and a 64% payout on total cash earnings per share if you normalize cash earnings for semiannual interest payments on our convert and that’s prior to their conversion. The distribution is payable on May 28th to common shareholders of record as of May 14th. Finally we’re holding our annual shareholder’s meeting at 9 AM Pacific today. Guideline details are available on our website at kkr.com under events and presentation. And I’ll pass things to Mike.
Mike McFerran: Thanks, Pam, and good morning, everyone. This morning we announced first quarter net income available to common shareholders of $92 million or $0.46 per diluted common share. This compares to $77 million of net income or $0.40 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2012. The largest driver of this increase was realized and unrealized gains on investments which have benefited and continued strong performance in both the equity and debt benefits. First quarter net income consisted of $140 million of total revenues, $81 million of total investment cost, $74 million of other income and $35 million of other expenses. Our total revenues increased 5% from the fourth quarter the biggest drivers here were oil and gas and other revenue which increased $3.5 million $2.7 million respectively from last quarter. Other revenues primarily consisted of dividends from a combination of special situations real estate and opportunistic energy investments. Oil and gas revenue benefited from two things increased production from the joint strategy investments we made in 2012 and higher realized prices across our drilling and royalty strategies. Total investment costs for the first quarter increased 12% for the fourth quarter at $81 million most of this resulted from the $11 million increase in our provision for loan losses we thought it was prudent to add a little allowance which now stands at 3.5% of the advertise cost basis of our loans held for investments. Other income almost doubled from the fourth quarter to $74 million in the first quarter. This positive impact was mostly from $95 million of realized and unrealized investment gains with the majority coming from realized gains on loans and unrealized gains on the equity investments (for much) markets. Partially offsetting those benefits were realized and unrealized losses on foreign exchange and derivatives mostly unrealized losses on our commodity hedges. It may seen counter-intuitive the rise in natural gas prices to be a negative for us from an earnings standpoint. And the part of our hedge is essentially locking a guaranteed sales price for a portion of the commodities we produce on our current or expected sales prices surpass that guaranteed price we experience on the loss on the value of our hedge. Marks on our hedges are offset by the assets favorable tax since we don’t market our energy investments to market under GAAP. This quarter’s results also include $24 million of one-time non-cash charges as a result of the extinguishment of our 7.5% converts that Pam described so, both of this came through other income as a $20 million loss on debt extinguishment. The other $4 million was a write off of deferred financing fees that flow through interest expense. We’ve been amortizing the deferred financing fees over the life converts so the write off that accelerates the amortization we expected to incur over the next few years. The debt extinguishment charge is a difference between the fair value of the debt component of the converts when we did the conversions and while we are carrying the debt – as of year end. While other increments and the big driver of earnings over the last year is important to remember that this large drive and gains on exits and market-to-market on the assets we account for it and estimated fair value. Both of these are highly variable with asset prices so other incomes more volatile and therefore less predictable. Finally other expenses totaled $35 million for the first quarter up $21 million from the fourth quarter the increase was almost entirely attributable to higher management and incentive fees. The management fees rose because of the new preferred common equity reissued while incentive fees were a function of the strength of this quarter’s earnings. Collectively these results drove $0.19 of run rate cash earnings per share for the first quarter including this last semiannual interest payment on the 7.5% convertible notes we eliminated straight-line in that payment as that for quarterly we generate a normalized $0.22 of run rate cash earnings per share for a 9% annualized cash return on equity. This was down from a normalized $0.26 in the fourth quarter. Looking at total cash earnings per share which includes cash gains we generate $0.03 or $0.33 normalized from that last convert payment I mentioned. This is down from a normalized amount of $0.36 from the fourth quarter. I do want to highlight that our cash earnings figures on the per share basis so they are impacted by the 15% increase in our common share count resulting from the retirement of our 7.5% convertible notes. We’re pleased to continue deliver returns at these levels despite having them over $700 million of cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. On our last quarterly call we discussed some actions we took in the first quarter capitalizing today’s historically low rates and create meaningful long term value for our shareholders. Specifically issuing perpetual preferred shares and as I mentioned terminating the conversion rights on our 7.5% converts. Having to please us our balance sheet today is now particularly strong we have no market-to-market debts our next maturity is 23 years from now and were only levered 0.3 times on the debt to equity basis. Of course leverage isn’t just a measure of percentage of equity. (inaudible) and churns are actually most important in tight spending environments like we’re witnessing today would be easy to use short-term leverage to enhance returns on lower market yields. This could have the intended effective increase in earnings in the short term but also introduces meaningful downside risk. 30 year unsecured bonds perpetual preferred equity on the core opposite end of the risk spectrum from short term total rate of return swap financing and when risk-on it goes to risk off that distinction is very evident. We’ve positioned this company have a debt structure that is insulated from short-term market volatility coupled with ample drypowder, this should enable to us to be opportunistic (inaudible) be under defensive. Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Mike. We’re having best features in the balance sheet Mike just described is the liquidity we have today. We ended the quarter with over $700 million of cash, that’s an addition to our $150 million revolver and mez notes we could sell out of our CLO position. The obvious question is why set on so much cash? We think it’s critical because of the environment we find ourselves in. As you can tell from our Q1 results 2013 began like the last few years with markets expiring and also there is for risk assets. And this was despite some less than favorable news, for example out of Europe including European unemployment statistics that didn’t even make the markets (pledge). Asset prices have been overpowered by the magnitude and demand for yield and that demand has led the loosening lending standards, this gives us pause. In a quarter full of records, record issuance, record highs we kept our focus on disciplined capital deployment that makes us contrarian in today’s world. In the credit market specifically the world record came up a lot this quarter not surprisingly the continued combination of technical and optimistic sentiment kept loan and bond yields near record, record lows of just north of 5.5% in Q1. Demand is seemingly never been stronger, CLOs had another post crisis quarterly issuance record of $28 billion in Q1 and retail inflows in the loan bonds regularly surpassed prior records in the back half of the quarter. And unfortunately all of the demand has outstretched supply given a relatively lengthy period of little global M&A volume. The majority of Q1’s record aggregate loan and high yield issuance has stemmed from refinancing, 79% of loan and 69% of bond volume reflected either refinancing or re-pricing as opposed to truly new paper within the market. So it’s a little wonder what that incremental capital deployment to our biggest strategy historically bank loans and high yields financed through CLOs was more muted this quarter. We continued ramping CLO 2012-1 to 97% at March 31, so we actually didn’t (print) at CLO in Q1. That said we did start to purchase assets earmarked for a potential new CLO. Since we don’t have any CLOs we have to ramp by a certain date, we can be patient selecting specific assets, which is increasingly important as lower quality issuers have gained access to the market. It’s easy to lose side of credit quality in today’s risk-on environment but our process and discipline have lend themselves to quality asset selection over time. Just to give you a sense we only had one high yield bond default in the company’s eight year history of investing within high yield. At times like this when risk across asset classes is been priced so aggressively we really benefit from our flexibility. Our structure led us take advantage of the breadth of opportunities sourced by our manager which we did in Q1. Much of our recent activity is been in more liquid strategies. We think these provide attractive risk-adjusted returns today not only because they have a less transparent pricing mechanism but also because the market’s current focus on liquidity makes them relatively less interesting or accessible to the marginal investor. These situations are less dependent on market technicals, and KKR can work one-on-one with the company seeking capital to set terms specific to the circumstance and their needs. Let me walk through our strategies to give you a sense of how this type of flexibility is played into what we’ve been doing. Any returns I mentioned are specific to those to common equity. Our first quarter return on average on net equity was 18% across all our strategies up from 17% last quarter. Excluding gains our run rate return on capital was 10%. In bank loans and high yields financed, generated through CLOs we generated 16% run rate and a 34% total return on equity for the quarter. The Natural Resources our second largest strategy by average net equity exposure we generated an 8% run rate and 4% total loss on equity for the quarter reflecting the mark-to-market impacted our hedges that Mike referenced. In special situations we are able to create value in loans and securities through active restructuring efforts including at EDMC and Travelport. Collectively this activity contributed to a 12% run rate and a 56% total return on capital in special situations. Our focus is remained on private opportunities and we have an active pipeline of these globally. Most recently we deployed nearly $30 million through a financing of Spanish building materials manufacturer Uralita for a private loan through its subsidiary URSA helping the company to repay current lenders and develop European information business, which has very little Spanish exposure and significant leverage to growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our mezzanine strategy generated a 21% run rate and a total return on equity in Q1. We feel we’ve been quite disciplined in building this portfolio over the last couple of years, underwriting quality credits and avoiding venturing of the risk spectrum as the lending market (inaudible). This paid off in Q1 the form of completed or announced realizations of several positions, including RBS WorldPay, IMCD and a portion of our investment in Stork. From a deployment perspective we continue to be very careful in providing mezzanine capital. On the opposite end of this spectrum from an opportunity perspective is commercial real estate. This is an area where we’ve seen the most activity since we last spoke. Our targets here our properties where we have a competitive advantage that goes beyond just the acquisition of real estate specifically in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. These are industries where KKR has an exceptionally long private equity track record and well-connected resources that can help us form a (inaudible) market areas, assets, regulation and specifically within retail tenants. These are also some of the most operationally intensive industries in real estate. We can be a differentiated buyer into the KKR’s ability to bring operational professionals and capabilities to these relevant properties. And these real estate subset sectors are also fragmented which gives us maximum optionality in terms of exits. In the quarter we committed four new transactions, the first is Legends Outlets, which is an outlet bond in Kansas City that we acquired out of foreclosure but we think we can improve the leasing profile of the company substantially. Second with Sentio Healthcare Properties a non-listed healthcare-focused REIT where we’ve committed to a 7.5% convertible preferred equity security to help that company reach scale. Third with Colonie Center a super-regional mall in Albany which we acquired from a special servicer at a substantial discount to its replacement cost. And the last was a 360-key hotel in the Midwest which we plan to substantially renovate and move up market. We expected to deploy an aggregate 90 million to 130 million to these opportunities over time over 80 million of which has been deployed as of today. On our existing real estate portfolio we generated a 72% total return on equity for the quarter and private equity we earned 37% total return on equity in Q1 greater than 12% appreciation in the first quarter. Across our strategies we remain focused on finding windows of opportunity to put our cash to work. Across all markets we’ve been looking in areas where supply demand disconnects are the greatest, often these areas are in our core strategies, sometimes they are adjacent. For example in financial services, European (bank key) leveraging has made available not just assets but even interesting businesses, for example like large ticket lending or leasing property, casualty, life insurance or annuity operations. They are no longer core to these banks but have highly attractive cash flow profiles and longer term business dynamics that are attractive. Many asset classes have begun the year on a strong note that’s why we are happy we are limited to any one of them. It’s exactly this type of environment when return is hard to earn without taking excessive risk that proves out the benefits of KFN’s flexible structure. We don’t have to buy in the private markets, KFN’s adaptability means we can get it elsewhere out of (retried) valued holdings and undervalued assets or businesses to have a cap of the work as we did this quarter. We believe that this is what distinguishes our company and it is ultimately what will drive the value we will create for you as our shareholders. Thanks for joining us this morning. We are happy to take any questions you have. Operator if you could open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Scott Valentin from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Scott Valentin – FBR Capital Markets: Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to dividend and the run rate and how we think about it going forward the dividend is $0.21 the run rate this quarter exist the convert came in was $0.22 so pretty close. Just wondering how you think about kind of the total revenue line the run rate line given selling off some of the interest earning assets like mezz and high yielding bank loan and replacing what other maybe less applicable assets. Just wondering how you think about the growth of that total revenue line and maybe that the dividend payout ratio so to speak going forward.
Mike McFerran: Sure. If you when you think about total revenue clearly a bigger growing part of our earnings over time it has been or continue to be what you see coming to other income as we do moderate capitals deployed to assets that will have more episodic gains and cash flow activity especially through what you see in our special situation strategy well you are not holding those assets as long-term yield replace you are holding them to work through a situation but exist hopefully in attractive multiple where you head in a situation. So I think when we think about looking forward on revenue we are conscious that run rate albeit important as one piece not the whole puzzle. Second Bill talked about where we stood with the point capital and commercial real estate those we’ve entered into forward transactions since our last earnings call there similar to our national resources strategy usually when you enter into one of these assets you’re going through a period of development or renovation of the asset you acquire. There is a bit of a J-curve why you are deploying some capital to prepare that assets for future run rate then you actually start to seeing some beautiful cash flows at some point in the future. So I think in reference we’ve made to-date and the capital we’ve committed should result in a revenue by increasing or else been equal.
Bill Sonneborn: Just add to what Mike said Scott that when you start $713 million of cash at quarter end that was basically earnings no income redeploying that into a income oriented assets will be material in terms of run rate on a going forward basis.
Scott Valentin – FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks guys that was helpful. And then you mentioned I guess you are collecting assets for CLO. Could you have any insight and maybe to have how much you’ve collected so far?
Bill Sonneborn: We’ve entered into the amount at this point is significant so it’s common was we’re being selective and taking our spots with them. The right thing is we’re in a clearly a very high price environment to really focus on identifying the assets that we really ignore him Mike without the fields and how to make a rush what you shouldn’t if win the next fields in hand obviously we’ll be ramping on a more accelerated basis.
Scott Valentin – FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Thank you for the opportunity. My first question is you mentioned a comment regarding taken provision higher as the prudent thing to do. Do you mind I guess just providing some additional color I mean in terms of what you have seen on the credit for in the portfolio and in essence what’s triggered the provision and I get it it’s down pretty massively year-over-year but still just looking for some color there?
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks. I appreciate it Daniel. We had a good quarter and we did the bottom up fundamental analysis credit by credit that we typically do and feel very comfortable with our portfolio where it stands today but the same time we also know where we are in a risk on environment in the growth of covenant why issuance increased leverage of a number of businesses due to dividend recaps in the life generally across the market but just feeling that it top down adjustments back to 3.5% allowance to our loans held for investment was prudent.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: So I guess the way to revisit that you are targeting the 3.5 it’s not in reaction to specific performance in the book?
Unidentified Company Representative: That’s correct.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Excellent. And then my second question and I appreciate that this could be difficult but in terms of the total the first question be what was the total dollars investment proceeds deployed in the quarter and then what has been committed over the course of the first quarter. And then how should we think about that the timing of putting this capital to work I get it that you are focusing a little bit more on commercial opportunities but I assume there is some lead time between the announcement of the opportunity and when we’ll start to see it impact the income statement. So aggregate dollar amount the timing and then just I assume T plus 1000 is the way to think about the returns there but just want to double check? Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: So we always thought it was the dollar amount we deployed growth dollars a little over $150 million actually cash out the door during since year end. As far as commitments we talked about a range commercial real estate, total commitments we entered in the quarter was to be in the results of capital going out somewhere in the range of $170 million to just a little over $200 million.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: And the answer to your follow-up question is yes we are targeting minimum expected returns of 10-year Treasury plus 1000.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: And then timing I guess between the deployment of the capital going out the door and see that reflect on the financial statements?
Unidentified Company Representative: It’s really going to be a function of which assets on the commercial real estate strategy which represented the majority of our activity this quarter. I would expect probably run rate income on a blended basis for those assets usually starting to six to 12 months after you make the investments clearly if you make any private equity investments or depending on what you are doing in the especial situations again is less focus on run rate and then any debt instruments we buy obviously starting yielding assets left again.
Unidentified Company Representative: Exactly it’s a mix bag and the year lead investment that we made during are committed to just recently as of example when asked or begin showing up in the P&L immediately.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Excellent. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht from Stephens. Your line is open.
John Hecht – Stephens: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked actually but one question is can you have the dollar amount per share of the carrying value versus the fair value at this point?
Unidentified Company Representative: We do John it’s actually.
Unidentified Company Representative: The H13 of the supplemental materials.
John Hecht – Stephens: Okay. I can get that.
Unidentified Company Representative: You see that carrying value as of quarter end so where our balance sheet book value is $0.93 and the dollar of our corporate debt portfolio with the fair market value of north of $0.95 across all of our corporate debt. So, basically two points below fair market value.
John Hecht – Stephens: Okay. I can figure that on a per share basis. And then what if the you mentioned that you consider selling the mezzanine CLO assets to create liquidity. What are you returns in those right now?
Unidentified Company Representative: They are yielding to us from the yield maturity perspective sub 8% and the cash on cash portion of that yields is sub 3% and so redeploying that into Treasury plus 1000 would be accretive to our shareholders as we find opportunities going forward.
John Hecht – Stephens: Okay. Thanks and last question is what are you looking for what should we be looking for I guess to kind of shake the market and cost risk spreads to widened to a point where we think that opportunities to go for your guys the point capital would become substantial rather than just looking for opportunities and the mix at this point?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well we are always looking John for supplying the band amounts for capital deployment we’ve been consistent in view of how much risk we are willing to take and there are areas when you want to be on your front foot and won and areas when you want to be cautious. And so we expect over as we kind of entered the seventh ending of the credit cycles of example continue to find opportunities from European bank de-leveraging some of the challenges going on in that continent we expect volatility increases the capital deployment pace will increase logarithmically.
John Hecht – Stephens: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our last question is from Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors. Your line is open.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning, Lee.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Good morning, good morning. Congratulations guys doing a terrific job. I guess you conservative world is not too conservative these days but nothing wrong with that. Just state me some brain damage I think the question may have been answered already but if you look at our earnings on our normal like a run rate to taking out usual things which I think is what the board will look at as regards to the recurring quarterly dividend is fair to say that the run rate is around $0.22 or is that understating the current run rate of earnings.
Unidentified Company Representative: I think it’s probably all of Lee this quarter we had well the normalized amount that was $0.22 but also reflected onetime tax payment equates about $0.02. So again every deals been normalized for the quarter probably would have been around $0.24.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: And that’s including the cash drag impact on the run rate.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: With that I’ll get to my second question. So you are seeing 1000 over treasuries, you have $700 million cash, you got a revolver and use of $150 million. What would you think given the fact you have no maturities for a very long period of time. What would be a minimal cash that you would want to hold to operate the business?
Unidentified Company Representative: One benefit we recall we placed our revolver with a credit facility that’s not based on a sort of asset base that we borrow against so we’ve got a $150 million credit facility is untapped and that was up to give back to working capital really whenever we need. The amount of cash we would actually need to sit down with the current quarter to run the business and service debt is frankly de minimis.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Right. So..
Unidentified Company Representative: Which is better – we’d be contend to point just about all this capital to the wide opportunities.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Right. So we could say $700 million divide that by $197.2 million shares is theoretically there is $0.35 in earnings out there on an annualized basis that we could grab once we see prudent lending opportunities?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah and plus you have the reinvestment of the mezz notes and the credit facility that we deployed into earning assets as well.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Got you, alright. This might be ahead of myself but in terms of the board view of the dividend, are you guys trying to be like Corporate America and bump this thing every July assuming the fundamental outlook is favorable and we feel comfortable I think, if the Board will review the dividend in a favorable way in July?
Unidentified Company Representative: The Board did have a discussion on the dividend this quarter, we were roughly $0.21 and we will obviously have a big discussion with Board in our next meeting and will report back to you with the outcome of that is.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Okay, good one. It looks through like in a July pattern but alright good luck, you’re doing a very good job and we all appreciate that.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Lee. I appreciate as well.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Thanks again for the follow-on opportunity. I just want to clarify something I thought I heard a comment earlier about some interest expense in the quarter that won’t be recurring or did I just misunderstand I guess should I say, should we be thinking about a different run rate interest expense for Q2 or was that just mean missing something?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, we did. We talked about we had a $24 million one-time non-cash charge related to taking out of converts, of that amount $4 million was for interest expense which was a write-off of deferred finance cost that was a one-time amount.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Excellent. Thank you for the clarity. And then my final question and I get it it’s speculative, but what’s your baseline scenario for (QE3) paper, what you expect to see in the fixed income markets and how is your strategy today in that setting you up for that expectation? Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: We expect the Federal Reserve particularly for the duration this year to keep short-term rates quite low. We do think that the change of the Federal Reserve Chairman no matter what direction President Obama goes will be more (dervish) than what we have today. We expect in 2014 long-term rates particularly focused on the tenure to appreciate substantially going from somewhere in the range of 1.65% up to three or higher as a result of kind of the curve adjusting. We think there is short-term impacts not only because of the (QE) on the 85 billion monthly purchases but also the end devaluation and Japanese investors putting $2 based assets is a defensive mechanism.
Daniel Furtado – Jefferies: Thank you for the opportunity everyone.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Sonneborn for closing remarks.
Bill Sonneborn: Well thank you all for letting us go through the quarter with you. We’ll get back to work and look forward to talk to those of you that have dialed into the shareholder meeting coming up here in a little bit. And hopefully we will have a good quarter this coming quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Pam Testani.
Pam Testani - Investor Relations: Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. I am joined by Bill Sonneborn, our CEO; and Mike McFerran, our COO and CFO. We’d like to remind everyone that this call will contain forward-looking statements based on management’s beliefs, which do not guarantee future events or performance. These statements are subject to substantial risks that are described in greater detail both in our SEC filings and in the supplemental information presentation posted to our website. Actual results may vary materially from today’s statements. We’ll also refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in the supplements. Before turning the call over to Mike and Bill to discuss our results, strategy performance, and the macro environment, let me start things off with some fourth quarter highlights. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.21 per common share, which is consistent with the distribution declared for the third quarter and a special distribution of $0.05 per common share. This brings cumulative distributions for the year to $0.86 per common share. The quarterly distribution is payable on February 28 to shareholders of record as of February 14 and the special distribution is payable on March 28 to shareholders of record as of March 14. In addition, this afternoon we reported fourth quarter net income of $77 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share and fiscal year 2012 net income of $348 million or $1.87 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter and 2012 results reflect a 17% and 20% return on shareholders’ equity respectively. Our book value per share totaled $10.31 as of December 31st, which represents a 10% increase from the end of 2011. I’ll now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike McFerran - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Pam, and good afternoon, everyone. Before beginning with our financial results, I wanted to highlight that we have changed our income statement presentation slightly to help you match up revenues and expenses for our segments, specifically natural resources. This change in presentation does not impact our net reported results, but it is useful in understanding the company’s revenue and expenses. Now, I’ll review our results for you then spend a little time discussing our liquidity and capital structure. Today, we announced net income of $77 million or $0.40 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter. This is effectively flat with net income of $77 million or $0.43 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2011. The decline on a per share basis year-over-year was related to our 7.5% convertible notes, specifically an increase in the conversion rate to account for distributions made in our common shares in 2012, and the change in our intended settlement method to all equity. Q4 net income consisted of $134 million of total revenues, $73 million of total investment costs, $37 million of other income, and $21 million of other expenses. Total revenues declined 2% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Loan and securities interest income declined in aggregate by $12 million, which was predominantly offset by the increase in oil and gas revenue of $9 million. Overall, the change and composition of our revenue is consistent with our expectations for the following reasons. First, as we have migrated capital from our bank loan and high yield strategy to natural resources during 2011 and 2012. We are seeing a growing portion of our revenue come from natural resources. However, based on where we are in the lifecycle of this strategy. We believe that we are in the expansionary phase from a revenue perspective as our assets develop. In addition we have seen securities income decline as expected due to divestures over the last six months of a significant portion of our high yield bond portfolio given the spread compression in the sector. From June 30th to December 31 we have reduced our bond holdings in our bank loan and high yield strategy by about 39% from $618 million par amount to $379 million par amount at year end. This was driven by the tight market spreads we saw in bonds in during the second half of 2012 and the relative value trade off between leverage loans which are generally senior in the capital structure and floating rates and high yields bonds which are generally supportive to loans and fixed rate. The third factor that has had a modest impact on the income is the amortization on four of our CLOs that are no longer in their reinvestment periods. Accordingly principal repayments on CLOs 2051, 2052, 2061 and 2007A are used to reduce the principal amount of senior notes outstanding and are no longer reinvested in new assets in these structures. Moving on to total investment costs, you will see that we have moved oil and gas expenses to this line item and we are now breaking out productions costs which are primarily cash expenses versus depletion, depreciation and amortization which are non-cash expenses. This should help you see trends in our national resources portfolio more clearly and give you the ability to calculate EBITDA for this strategy. Investment costs for the fourth quarter reflected a $22 million or 43% increase from the fourth quarter of 2011. This was primarily driven by the ramp up of our national resources strategy over the past year, which witnessed an $8 million increase in production expenses and a $5 million increase in DD&A. Interest expense increased by $5 million year-over-year, which was almost exclusively driven by the aggregate $374 million of 30-year senior notes we issued in November of 2011 and March of 2012. In addition we wrote off $2 million of previously capitalized costs related to our prior revolving credit facility that was replaced during the fourth quarter. Going forward assuming that all of our convertible notes are retired, this will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $13 million per year with the last interest payment made in the first quarter of 2013. I will come back to this topic in a bit when I discuss our decision to terminate the conversion feature of these notes, which is led to essentially all note holders surrendering them for conversion to shares. Other income which represents a realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, derivatives, foreign exchange and fee income totaled $37 million for the fourth quarter. This represents a $24 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2011. The $37 million primarily consists of $23 million of realized gains including $8 million from the sale of our high-yield securities during the quarter. Other income also benefited from a $4 million unrealized gain from our commodity price hedges and from $5 million of other income primarily related to fees we see during the quarter. As you have seen over the last several quarters other income experienced a significant fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter based on asset prices, repayments and gains or losses on divestitures. Other expenses totaled $21 million for the fourth quarter, which represents a modest 6% decline from the prior year period. Our reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 represents a 17% return on equity and for the full year ended December 31, 2012 a 20% return on equity. Book value per common share totaled $10.31 as of year end as compared to $10.09 as of the end of the third quarter and $9.41 as of the end of 2011. Looking at cash, on a normalized basis where we straight-lined the impact of our semi-annual convertible note interest payment, we generated a $0.26 of run-rate cash earnings per share or a 10% run-rate cash earnings return on equity and $0.36 of total net cash earnings per share which represents a 14% total cash return on equity. These amounts convert our normalized $0.29 of run rate and $0.21 of total net cash earnings per share for the third quarter of 2012. Before handing this over to Bill, I will spend a little time on our capital structure and liquidity. With respect to the former, we have made a lot of progress on already strong capital structure since we last spoke. We have operated under a pretty simple principle over the past 14 months or so, which is with rates at historic lows, we can create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders by sourcing low-cost, long-term non-mark-to-market debt. Things won’t always be this way, I can sure assure you. With that mindset, we have attempted to be both thoughtful and creative. Now, we have evolved our capital structure. Here is where we are today. We have $284 million of 30-year trust preferred securities that don’t start maturing until 2036. Of this amount, $155 million bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 7.7%. The remainder bear interest at a weighted average rate of LIBOR plus 238 basis points. But as we previously mentioned, we have entered into interest rate swaps through their maturity that lock in a weighted average fixed rate of 3.8%. We have completed two senior note transactions issuing a combined $374 million of 30-year fixed rate notes at a blended rate of 8.1%. And in January, we completed our first ever preferential preferred offering through which we issued $374 million of perpetual preferred shares with a cap 7.38% distribution rate. Last, as we announced a few weeks ago, we exercised our ability to terminate the conversion feature on our 7.5% convertible notes, which had $172.5 million outstanding at year end. We have been asked by some of you why we decided to do this. The answer is pretty simple. The convert was expensive to our shareholders. In addition to receiving a 7.5% cash coupon, each quarter that we distributed more than $0.05 per share to our common shareholders, the number of shares that we would have to deliver upon conversion increased and not by an insignificant amount. To give you a sense of the magnitude of these adjustments from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, holders of these converts were entitled to 1.7 million more shares just because of that conversion rate adjustment, an increase of 7.3%. As a result, it was only getting more expensive to take these out. We are paying $12.9 million of annual interest expense. Given that background, we believe it was in the best interest of shareholders to terminate the conversion rights of noteholders as soon as we have the chance, which is exactly what we did. The only question was how to settle no conversions in the most attractive way for our shareholders through cash payment, issuing shares, or a combination thereof. We had originally anticipated settlement conversions in the combination of cash and shares. While as our shares traded off after our announcement, that method became more dilutive. Relative to our initial plan, it was accretive to settle entirely in equity as the new shares were effectively issued at a premium to book value. For the 99.8% of conversions we have received so far, this is how we have proceeded with the settlement method that maximizes pro forma book value per share. Assuming the rest of the notes are converted and we have settled those in equity as well, our total share count will be about, it would increase by about 26.1 million shares. The estimated impact of this and the increase in equity from retirement to convertible notes would result in a pro forma book value per share of $9.84 as of December 31. This amount does not include non-cash P&L charge we expect to recognize during the first quarter of 2013 from the write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs related to these converts and the access of the estimated fair value of the debt components at the time of conversion over their par value. We planned to disclose that estimated charge in the subsequent event footnote to our financial statements in our 10-K that we will file later this month. Pro forma for the exclusion of our convertible notes and including our perpetual preferred equity issuance, our capital structure now consists of 1 billion face amount of long-term debt, perpetual preferred shares with a weighted average cost of just 7.1%. Across this capital, 64% has a remaining average maturity of 27 years and 36% is perpetual. This is a situation Bill and I sketched out as the ideal a few years ago. Long-term our perpetual low cost fixed rate capital that completely insulates us from mark to market volatility of asset prices that presents no refinancing risk. Next I want to provide you with an updates on our revolving credit facility. On November 30th, we closed on a new three year revolver to replace our prior facility scheduled to mature in May of 2014. The new revolver has a $150 million of capacity with the ability to upsize it to $350 million and critically it’s not subject to any mark to market provisions since it’s not an asset based credit facility. It’s a noteworthy improvement as compared to our old facility, which had a borrowing base where changes in asset values could impact borrowings outstanding. Additionally loans under the new facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%, which is 100 basis point reduction from our prior facility that bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%. And the new facility does not provided a cap on distributions to be paid of our common shareholders. It’s another noteworthy material improvement from our prior facility that had previously cap distributions at 65% of estimated taxable income. Based on the insulation from asset price movement that this facility provides, it gives us more flexibility, as an incremental source of capital are drawn even during severe market dislocations which will give us the comfort to deploy more capital in the future and to operate the plus cash on end. With respect to liquidity, we reported $238 million of cash as of year end and adjusted for the $362 million of net proceeds from our perpetual preferred offering. We have approximately $600 million of liquidity. About 20% to 30% of this is committed to our year earmarked for existing and identified opportunities through our national resources, special situations and commercial real estate strategy. That said, combined with our un-drawn $150 million credit facility and the ability to source incremental low cost capital to divest additional rated CLO notes. We are at great position to be opportunistic. With that I am going to hand this over to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Mike. The sentiment in Q4 continued the year’s theme of a global risk on rally despite or maybe even encouraged by the fiscal cliff trauma, yields remained the favorite play of the day and record flows pushed prices even higher than the height they reached in Q3. $85 billion of monthly buying by the fed certainly has influenced investor behavior. The S&P/LSTA leverage loan index was up 1.4% for the quarter while the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II index gained 3.2%. Between all these inflows and CLO issuance volumes over four times greater than 2011 issuers had been more active than ever. This year’s leverage loan and high-yield issuance of $812 billion beat 2007’s previous record by our whopping 20%. The abundance of buyers in the market means yield is getting squeezed and reward for talking risk is on the decline. High-yield bond yields dipped to a record level of 5.7% during the first few weeks of 2013. When you think of this situation on a spread basis the 10-year treasure went from 1.63% at September 30th to about 2% at the end of January, so the rally experienced in the fourth quarter and so far this year is even more meaningful. Shareholders were asked why we sit today with over $600 million of cash and liquidity. In our view we have entered the sixth inning of the credit cycle. We think that buoyant conditions will last for approximately around another 18 months. We have constantly stated that we will maintain discipline and focus on driving the best outcomes for our common shareholders. Even if that means maintaining excess liquidity to be in a position to drive shareholder returns when that cycle turns. With respect to our portfolio, we saw a consistent opportunity sets in our strategies in the fourth quarter. As I go through each of them, I will be referencing pages 10 and 11 of our supplement provided on our website for returns on capital. In total our fourth quarter return on average net equity as Mike mentioned was 17% across all our strategies, which was down from 26% in Q3. On a run rate basis, which excludes other income such as gains, return on equity was 14%. Our bank loan and high-yield strategy remains our largest strategy by average net equity was just over two-thirds. We execute this strategy mostly through CLOs. You can now see the breakout between balance sheet and CLO investments on page 16. During the fourth quarter, bank loans and high-yield generated a run-rate return on equity of 21% and a total return on equity of 28%. The fourth quarter’s continued spread tightening gave us an opportunity to take advantage of the CLO market. On December 21, we closed our first traditional syndicated CLO in five years, a $412 million structure at the four-year reinvestment period, non-call too with a weighted average liability spread of approximately LIBOR plus 209 basis points. KFN holds 52% of the subordinated notes or about $23 million worth. Through January 31, we had ramped about 80% of the deal into assets yielding a weighted average of LIBOR plus 408 basis points or with a weighted average LIBOR floor of just over 1%. We believe that the push for yield is driven by the Fed will only drive spreads tighter in the near-term, in loans in particular. Investors are beginning to appreciate floating rate exposure and the massive volume of fresh CLO capital recently raised must be put to work. We hope to use that tightening spread environment to print CLOs more regularly, however, we remained patient and disciplined. As we believe, liability spreads will keep tightening in the supply demand imbalance for loans today is resulting in a loan environment reminiscent of late 2006. In our second largest strategy by average net equity allocated, natural resources, we generated a 1% run-rate and a 11% total return on equity for the quarter. We continue to see strength in our royalty investments, which has been offset by slower ramp in our exploitation of proven producing properties. During the fourth quarter, we deployed $4 million toward existing commitments to royalties. We also committed $40 million, $10 million of which funded in January to a new drilling partnership with a private E&P company. Drilling opportunities today are outpacing opportunities in other of our natural resources fleets, largely due to massive supply demand imbalance in funding capital intensive development projects in the North American shale plays. Thanks to KKR’s flexibility, is able to structure these deals in a way that’s quite attractive to KFN from a risk reward perspective. In mezzanine, we generated a 23% run rate and a 27% total return on equity for the fourth quarter. As you will now see on page 17 of the supplement, the portfolio was generating a 15% total coupon with incremental upside from capital appreciation through our equity exposure linked to those investments. We didn’t deploy any incremental capital during the quarter as the backdrop has remained largely the same as in recent quarters. The strength in the U.S. credit markets means larger cap mezzanine lending in the U.S. is not as interesting for any, but the least creditworthy borrowers. The opportunities that remain somewhat brighter in Europe, with a pullback in bank lending, has enabled KFN to be a capital provider in a market that is effectively for a time acted as a capital vacuum. You saw evidence of this in our two most recent mezz transactions, which we mentioned in last quarter’s earnings call. In special situations, we generated a 9% run rate and a 28% total return on equity. We have broken out the portfolio in more detail on page 18 of the supplement. As you know, these assets are up and distressed and subject to quarterly marks. So, we, as the management team, look at IRR condition to return on equity to fully understand and measure our performance. Through December 31, our approximately $370 million of cost basis in special situations investments has generated an IRR of 18% with an IRR of 38% on fully realized investments, and 13% on those that were still in. Looking at the overall market for distressed, our highest levels of activity remain outside the U.S. We continue to see pockets of opportunities, but they are migrating away from the secondary market of distressed investments we have observed for the past several quarters and into more proprietary and private opportunities. This transition makes our KKR affiliation that much more valuable. The firm’s global reach across business idea generation and relationships have provided meaningful inroads to attractive situations. Turning to fourth quarter, we deployed or committed to deploy about $32 million. Our largest single capital deployment in the quarter was about $18 million to acquire a portfolio of underperforming loans in Australia from a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank in the UK. We are able to acquire them in a highly attractive price of $0.40 on the $1 of particularly, largely because of KKR’s comfort in restructuring the non-performing companies and taking an active role in driving long-term value creation as a fresh and new equity program. The market rally and massive flows in the leverage loans and high yield bonds in the U.S. are definitely impacting the number of secondary distressed investing opportunities we see. So, we are actually benefiting from these trends in our existing positions, such as Oriental Trading, which we sold to Berkshire Hathaway in the fourth quarter. Moving to real estate, we generated a 61% total return on equity for the fourth quarter. Given that our current investments aren’t contributing much run-rate income yet, we don’t know have the run-rate return on equity. We deployed $3 million in the quarter towards prior commitments and the team continues to see a quite robust pipeline of opportunities. Our previous investments continue to perform in line with or ahead of budget. Finally, in private equity, we generated a 29% total return on equity for the fourth quarter. We also deployed an incremental $10 million to two private equity co-investments. The first was Alliant Insurance Services, which is the largest specialty insurance brokerage firm in the United States. The other was Acteon, which is a leading UK based service provider to the worldwide offshore oil and gas and renewable energy markets. Taking a step back, we’ve spent 2012 delivering on the goals we have laid out over the last couple of years. First, we continued our diversification efforts deploying almost $400 million during the year to strategies besides our core allocation of bank loans and high yields, focusing on optimizing our ability to generate the best risk adjusted returns in capital for our shareholders. Second, we redoubled our focus on tangible shareholder value, raising our distribution for the third consecutive year, and creatively managing our capital structure to minimize dilution to our common shareholders. Third, by deploying that capital in new investments that include naturally embedded free options or low-cost options, we have positioned ourselves to protect shareholder capital in a wide variety of macroeconomic environments. Fourth, we have taken advantage of our flexibility to pivot allocations in response to rapidly changing market conditions being prudent with our cash and de-risking as asset prices have run up. And finally, by continuing to improve our balance sheet and minimize its reliance on short-dated or mark-to-market funding, we have given ourselves even more flexibility to invest when markets dislocate in a longer runway to watch those investments play out over the long-term. I note on this topic that we are able to issue over $350 million of what equates to our shareholders of tax deductible perpetual preferred equity during the quarter to the very rare type of issuance by any firm, but certainly a publicly traded partnership. Assuming an after tax cost of that perpetual preferred of approximately 4% to our common holders, such capital represents an enormous opportunity to create shareholder value. We sit here today with over $600 million of liquidity, which represents approximately 30% of our equity. If we achieve our objectives with this capital, that is to deploy it at our target return of treasuries plus 1000 basis points, maintain our discipline, and not comprise in the level of risk we are willing to take. We can drive significant additional earnings and distributions. When you combine that with our options on substantially higher Fed funds raised, inflation, natural gas prices, equity sensitive assets, you have an opportunity to drive increased shareholder value in the years to come. Our position to continue to deliver that value we feel really proud of our team that has worked so hard to create attractive opportunities for KFN and its shareholders. While not all will work, I am confident the team is focused on the right things. I want to thank all of them, but I also want to thank all of you for your support and trust. Operator, we’ll now open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)
Pam Testani: Should we start with Lee Cooperman at Omega?
Operator: Yes, the first question comes from Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Thank you for very comprehensive rundown in the performance. I just want to make sure I am kind of relating to things properly. We have roughly what the 202 million fully diluted shares presently after the (call of the) risk that’s converters are higher than that?
Bill Sonneborn: That’s right, Lee.
Mike McFerran: That’s approximately correct.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Alright, good. So, if your target lending rate is treasuries plus 1000 and then you have $237.6 million on unrestricted cash and I gather you have the credit line of $350 million which is close to $600 million you are talking about? I am assuming goal in if that cost might be 2%. So, would it be realistic to think in terms of you have unutilized lending capacity of close to $600 million that you could generate between 9 and 10 percentage point net of before loan loss provisioning and additional income. Is that a reasonable way of looking at it?
Mike McFerran: Yes, but the one thing I want to correct, Lee, is that 600 million is in cash, and in addition to that, we have $150 million untapped line of credit that we can increase to $350 million. So, if we increase that line of credit to $350 million that number will be $950 million.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: $950 million. So, theoretically let’s take 9%, 10%, that’s like $80 million or something like that on 202 or 203 million shares that if you had the lending opportunities, you could generate incremental earnings of?
Bill Sonneborn: And then above and beyond that, we have still remaining what we have been selling CLO mezz notes, which yielding kind of a cash cost of roughly 3% than we could sell in the market or redeploy. So, there is a lot of leverage there and separating to think we also have capacity for additional long-term debt raises for additional capital given the convert takeout which hurt us with the rating agencies when it was still there and the equity credit that the preferential preferred gives us?
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. And then looking at the maturities of your debt, other than a minor amount of money, you have no consequential maturing debt for 23 years?
Bill Sonneborn: Really, no maturities for 23 years, well other than a small oil and gas credit facility down and so…
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Okay. Let me go on a few other, I am pleased that I understand everything so far. What do you think is the best measure of sustainable profitability that the Board would lever off to determine a dividend, in other words, the cash run-rate of $0.27 was 11% ROE, total net earnings normalized was $0.36 or 14% ROE, what do you think as you look at the structure of your business and how you allocate different amounts of capital to different activities? Is this a 14%, 15% ROE business over time or is it lower than that those earnings that would determine the distributable cash?
Mike McFerran: Our goal is to generate treasuries plus a 1000, which will flush away based upon what the interest rate environment, so treasuries plus 1000 a day is 12%.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: 12% right, okay.
Mike McFerran: On a pro forma basis. We have parts of our portfolio that are earning quite high relative to that, but we are talking about incremental dollar in the ground just given the benefit of some of the legacy CLOs, but if that tenure goes up another 200 basis points, then you would be at that 14% return on equity.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: That’s good. And then a couple of years ago, I remember reading in the literature that you had a positive exposure rising interest rates that I think each one of your basis points would add about $10 million to EBITDA, what would that number be today?
Bill Sonneborn: So, in a supplement Lee on page 25, you will see the interest rate sensitivity of our credit portfolio. Now, it’s somewhat offset because we have lot of fixed rate debt in the holding company, but roughly you will see that the first kind of 100 basis points costs about $17 million and then we will start to creep that back. So, what we are hoping for in the context of a rate move is something more akin to 1994.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Great, great, great.
Bill Sonneborn: That would be very good for KFN.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: That’s okay.
Bill Sonneborn: In some ways we are shaping up for that as a potential possibility.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Alright, and then one last question, if 12% target ROE cash or earnings let’s say on our book value what kind of payout ratio would you guys be comfortable, you think the Board would be comfortable with. My understanding is that the cap has been removed on the new the credit facility, but I assume you’d like to retain some earnings and payout the bulk of them?
Bill Sonneborn: Yeah, I can’t speak for the Board, I’m just one member of that Board, so it will inappropriate for me to do that, but – and we have very fulsome discussions in the context of thinking about how much capital return to shareholders versus retained based upon opportunities we have, existing dry powder we have on the balance sheet and the like and so that all gets factored into the analysis of our distribution every quarter and every year.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: I guess one last observation or a question, you are set for rising inflation, rising interest rates, I guess the rest of the company would be if we go into a very deflationary environment.
Bill Sonneborn: Well, we tried to protect with that by having 30% of our common book value and cash, which is the best asset to have in deflation. So, we are trying to have a two-thirds of shareholders capital with an inflationary bet on, but we have one-third where we want to protect from our risk management if there is deflation and preserve shareholder capital, that’s one of the reason we’ve created the capital structure and yeah I’ll think of cash as an investment in certain times.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Alright, last one, you would talk about euro CLO efforts, is there anything looking perspective there?
Bill Sonneborn: We are still trying to skin that cap, it’s a very complex equation given some of the rules and regulatory regimes that have gone on and continued to transpire in Europe, but it is still strategically a goal that we have.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Alright, just congratulations to you and the whole team, you’ve done a terrific job and I appreciate it. Thank you.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Lee.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Furtado from Jefferies.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Thank you for the opportunity to ask you a question. The first one is assuming the forward outlooks for interest rate, how tight spreads are today. Is it safe to assume that for ‘13 the yield target a little bit more on the natural resources in terms of capital deployment or should we think about the deployment in ’12 as a way to model out ’13?
Mike McFerran: I mean, I think that’s a reasonable assumptions we set today, I mean if you just look at kind of what the market is saying in the contexts of the interest rate curve, it’s kind of saying very slow growth, low yield to the next five years, because if you look at kind of where the five year treasury is relatively to the 10-year treasury that implies that the buyers in the 10-year are expecting longer term inflation. But buyers that are in that kind of zero to five curve are not willing to admit that’s a possibility, and so natural resources and real estate are two reinvestments that provides cash yield (indiscernible) in different environments. So, we’ll have some capital deployment in this sector, but as we talked about that’s probably will more than a minority of our total capital. And if the CLO market which you’ve seen AAA spreads gone from like 145 to 140 now to 130, they have not tightened as fast as asset spreads have, but as they accelerate in the contexts of tightening, you could see more capital deployment and allocating more subordinated notes based upon the risk adjusted return in future CLO issuance.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Understood. Thank you. And if I may with a follow-up one, when we think about the 2012-1 CLO issuance, is it safe to assume lifetime hurdle rates of treasuries plus 1000 or how do you think about the and I get it there is a lot of moving parts there, but when you get into the deal, you must have some baseline assumption and kind of what formula are you building that CLO to?
Bill Sonneborn: For that CLO, that is the bogie, we and clearly when we take on treasuries plus 1000 nicely about that CLO to the nature of it gives us that ability for the portfolio to adjust accordingly if rates go up.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: And will there be – can you give us some guidance on how to think about the slope of the ROE if we assume all-in hurdle return or all-in IR is in the T plus 1000 range and is that relatively straight lined of is there some slope because you have that reinvestment period on the front end?
Mike McFerran: There will be some slope in the first two quarters, but then after that where you will see potentially more opportunity – so then you will actually be in that treasuries plus 1000. After that it really depends on what the credit markets do. If you saw assets that really widen out following a wave of prepayments or something you saw really in 2007 for the first half of the year it seems tight and tight and tight and the second half of the year spreads widened out then you will have the opportunity to employee a lot more capital at wider spreads. If that repeats itself then we can do better than what we are targeting.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Understood, thank you for that clarity, I appreciate it.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gabe Poggi from FBR.
Gabe Poggi - FBR: Hi, good afternoon guys my questions have been asked. Good job on the quarter.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Gabe.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Stewart from Compass Point.
Jason Stewart - Compass Point: Great, thank you. Can you give us an idea for what the average utilization on that warehouse line that was refinanced has been or maybe like the last year or so?
Mike McFerran: Absolutely, it was zero and the background on that is and as we mentioned in our remarks, A, we had liquidity where we didn’t need to use that revolving facility. And we haven’t used on for years and we frankly use that, we have that viewed that really as kind of a rainy day backup facility because the way it works it was a borrowing base where you pledge assets and declines in the fair value of assets would resolve then you have to pay it down or propose collateral. So, the benefit of the new facility we have in place is that we would actually expect to have much higher utilization because now we don’t have any negative precaution of asset price is falling. So, this gives us a lot more flexibility to use it opportunistically without the downside risk.
Jason Stewart - Compass Point: Okay and would there be a target level of cash that you would take that down to before utilizing this facility or…
Mike McFerran: We definitely would run we have – as we talked about pro forma $600 million of cash toady so we would have drawn that with a much a cash on the account. What it does change for us is Bill and I can operate the business with a different mindset of being able to run the business with a very small amount of cash knowing that we have that tech without any restriction.
Jason Stewart - Compass Point: Okay and then one last question. I think in one of your answers you said you may have sold some of the retained CLO notes I think 2007-1D was one and then the most recent, have you sold any of those subsequent to quarter end, it doesn’t look like was I missed it they were in the fourth quarter?
Mike McFerran: There was a small amount at the beginning of October that we talked about on our last call. There were none subsequent to quarter end and today we still hold and it’s in our supplement the number is about $85 million still of those Class D notes.
Jason Stewart - Compass Point: Got you. Okay, thank you for the questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Laws from Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Hi thanks for taking my questions and I appreciate all the data in the supplemental pack. To kind of follow up a little bit with what Daniel asked earlier kind of looking through the different business segments or targeted asset classes, it seems like you don’t find the mezzanine as attractive here and what you do see you prefer Europe over the U.S. And it looks like you did make some investments in special situations private equity and natural resources especially is that accurate. And then maybe can you comment on page 23 you kind of lay out a little bit of the commercial real estate strategy and maybe what type if any growth you guys think that occur there in 2013?
Bill Sonneborn: Sure good question. The U.S. mezz market and the reason that we just haven’t deployed there is we’ve tried to be pretty vocal of shareholders that we kind of have risk tolerance we will undertake and then we want to get that treasuries plus 1000 return with that risk tolerance. And because of the strength of the high-yield market the capital market here in the U.S. and the competition of lots of business development companies that focus exclusively or almost exclusively on the U.S. mezz market or second lien market, the return per unit of risk hasn’t met our threshold. So, where we found more opportunity is in Europe where there is fewer competitors. That being said a return of M&A volume which has also been slow in the U.S. could change that equation from the supply demand balance domestically. So, that’s the issue from a mezz perspective, how we thought about the asset class. When it comes to thinking about real estate, we can provide that disclosure on page 23. My answer is we do expect to announce and you will see press releases potentially in the next few weeks or months of additional asset acquisitions targeting those things again they can protect shareholders’ capital given acquisition at well below replacement cost have an opportunity to provide yield and have upside depreciation particularly in an inflation area.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Great and then I guess one kind of more housekeeping comment, on the share count obviously we had a higher diluted number given some of the – I guess balance sheet restructuring going on which seems like you guys have done a great job of that. Can you give us an idea of what we should look at is a fully diluted share count kind of going forward in our models?
Mike McFerran: Sure, so what you are seeing at December 31st, the reported share count number on the income statement is consistent with the assumption that we would settle all of the converts with the shares.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Right and so that’s the number we should look at as far as go forward or will you settle some of those conversions?
Bill Sonneborn: (Not followed) I think today with cash so that would capture most of the converts than we have may go on top of it, but as we expressed the total increase would be 26.1 million shares.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: So, that’s what we should look at the increase from that the number that’s on the balance sheet.
Bill Sonneborn: Yes, that will be the increase in outstanding shares.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Perfect. Again thanks for my questions and congratulations on very nice quarter.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jasper Burch from Macquarie.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: Hey, good afternoon guys. Bill I saw you said in the opening remarks that you expect buoyant conditions for at least another 18 months and it sounds like you are talking about in terms of spreads that are available on new investments does that sort of mean that we should expect relatively modest net investment unless we see some sort of disruption in asset pricing or credit spreads?
Bill Sonneborn: Well, I mean, especially there is lots of variables to that question, I did say we expect buoyant market conditions in the context of some in the credit markets to continue for at least 18 months and being the fixating of the credit cycle. And the reason being that may not impact capital deployment is talks about answer another question CLOs are very attractive asset class in periods of tightening credit spreads particularly when the liability side tightens at the same pace as the asset side. And you are starting to see liability spread they are tightened by 10 basis points just in the past six weeks they may tighten even further that moved down in the context of those structures locking in senior secured loans. And that treasuries plus 1000 and the optionality on that liability cost is extremely valuable for our shareholders. So, there is ways we can deploy substantial amounts of capital even in kind of those pretty strong credit market conditions that we’ve been experiencing over the past six months.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: Thank you, that’s helpful. And then completely different direction we’re seeing some I guess not quite peers, but similar companies announced, are not similar companies, but peers guys like New Castle announced splits, splitting of their companies and it’s definitely given them some sort of valuation premium with the individual parts are being looked as more valuable than the whole. I know that the operational flexibility is sort of one of your trademarks that’s been really helpful to the shareholder returns through the downturn. And I was just wondering do you think that your share price that you have given a full credit for the various parts and sort of what sort of upside would we have to see in your mind to sort of evaluation in order to consider something like that?
Bill Sonneborn: Jasper, all good questions and I think we’ve talked in previous calls that we are very, very focused on shareholder value and so yes we have a REIT sub, yes, have an MLP sub and so to the extent that – as those scale over time, the only way we can unlock true shareholder value is through swaps or spin-offs, it’s always something we are opened to consider, that’s an embedded option and quite there is an example of an embedded option we carry in the structure that we can unlock if market condition suggest that’s the best way to drive value for our common holders.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: Okay, well, thank you for taking my questions and nice job in the quarter.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)
Bill Sonneborn - Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you all, I appreciate again your trust and confidence. We look forward to getting back to work and trying to hit the targets we set out for us. Thanks.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Craig Larson – Head, IR Bill Janetschek – CFO Scott Nuttall – Global Head, Capital and Asset Management
Analysts:  Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer Roger Freeman – Barclays Michael Kim – Sandler O’Neill And so just to name a few Howard Chen – Credit Suisse Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs Robert Lee – KBW 
Operator: Good morning and welcome to KKR’s Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Sean. Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I’m joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO, and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We’d like to remind everyone that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements. We’ll also refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. This morning, we reported quarterly economic net income of $510 million and year-to-date economic net income of $1.8 billion, almost four times greater than last year’s figure. This translates into $0.69 of after-tax economic net income per unit this quarter and $2.42 per unit for the first nine months of 2012. The key driver here is the appreciation of our private equity funds, which increased approximately 6% in the quarter and for the first nine months of 2012 are up 20%, outperforming the MSCI World Index by over 600 basis points so far this year. Focusing on our cash metrics, total distributable earnings are $333 million for the quarter and for the first nine months of 2012 are $903 million, up over 40% relative to the first nine months of 2011. This growth originated from both realized cash carry as well as realized gains from our balance sheet. We announced a quarterly distribution of $0.24 per unit, of which about $0.15 came from carry and $0.09 came from fee-related earnings. This is not only a record for cash carry, the highest quarterly figure since we’ve gone public, but also the 10 consecutive quarter where we have seen cash carry in the distribution. Finally, two additional items of note. The first relates to our XI North American private equity fund, referred to internally as NAXI. The investment period for the 2006 Fund has officially come to a close, and, consequently, the investment period for NAXI, the successor to the 2006 Fund, commenced at the end of the quarter. You’ll see, for the first time, NAXI listed on the “Investment Vehicle Summary” table on page 20 of our press release, and fundraising will continue here into 2013. Bill is going to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact this has on our financials, now that NAXI has turned on and the 2006 Fund has moved to the post-investment period. And the second topic is Prisma. We’re pleased to announce that the transaction closed on October 1, and starting in the fourth quarter, Prisma will be reflected in our financial results within the Public Markets segment. The addition of Prisma provides us with the ability to provide customized hedge fund solutions to our clients and an attractive platform, which we can leverage to create new, more liquid products. This transaction, as you’ll recall, is the first strategic acquisition for us, and we are excited to officially welcome our newest colleagues to the firm. And with that, I’ll now turn it over to Bill.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We ended the third quarter with record assets under management of $66 billion, up 8% from last quarter and 13% from the same time last year. Investment appreciation contributes to a portion of the increase, helping offset distributions to LPs in the quarter, but the majority of the AUM growth was due to the fact that we now include $6 billion of capital we have raised so far for NAXI. It is important to remember that these numbers do not factor in an additional $15 billion of committed capital: $8 billion from Prisma, $4 billion ASIA II, $1 billion of the Texas Teachers mandate that we have not yet allocated and about $2 billion of capital in other vehicles that will be included in AUM once it is invested. As of September 30, our fee-paying AUM was also the highest we’ve reported, totaling $50 billion and representing a 6% jump from last quarter. Similar to AUM, the addition of NAXI’s third party capital positively impacted our fee-paying AUM, which more than offset the reduction in fee-paying assets of our 2006 Fund as it transitioned into the post-investment period. We’ve been getting a lot of questions about fund roll-off, so I wanted to spend some time on this. Let’s walk through an example using the 2006 Fund and NAXI. As Craig mentioned, in September, the investment period for the 2006 Fund ended and NAXI was activated. That said, we are still able to make follow-on investments in the 2006 Fund portfolio. If you turn to page 20 of our press release you will see $1.3 billion of uncalled commitments remaining in the 2006 Fund and we plan to invest these funds in the future. Turning on NAXI impacts our fee related earnings in two ways. First, we have raised $6.2 billion of capital so far, including our GP and employee commitments, and we are entitled to a management be on the third-party portion of that capital. As you may recall, the blended fee rate for the 2006 Fund was about 125 basis points. The management fee we will receive on NAXI is closer to 140 basis points, based on the capital raised to date. Second, when NAXI turned on, the 2006 Fund switched from the investment period to the post-investment period and the management fee the 2006 Fund is now based on invested, not committed, capital. As of September 30, the 2006 Fund had about $12 billion of remaining invested capital and we are now entitled to a fee of 75 basis points on remaining costs. Keep in mind, as we sell assets, the remaining costs will go down and so will our management fees associated with the 2006 Fund. Turning to our segment results, in Private Markets, fee-related earnings were $45 million, up 23% from last quarter and 8% from last year. Transaction fees, including the first closing of the Alliance Boots sale, helped to increase our fee-related earnings this quarter. For the first nine months of 2012, fee-related earnings were $119 million, down 30% from the $170 million we earned over the same time last year. Its year-over-year decline was largely driven by two things. First, in 2011, we had substantial termination payments in the first quarter related to the IPOs of Nielsen and HCA, which amounted to net fee-related earnings of about $38 million. Second, the $2.9 billion of capital we invested in the first three quarters of 2011 resulted in greater transaction fees than the $1.8 billion of capital we’ve invested so far this year. The 6% write-up in our private equity portfolio, combined with higher fee-related earnings in the quarter, translated into ENI of $214 million. This is up over 20% from the last quarter and year-to-date ENI is more than 2.5 times last year’s figure. Moving to Public Markets, fee-related earnings were $23 million compared to $12 million in both the last quarter and last year. This growth is attributable to significant incentive fees, which contributed about $18 million to our earnings. Third quarter ENI was $35 million, reflecting $12 million of net carried interest this quarter, primarily from our Special Sits accounts. This is the largest quarterly carry figure that we have reported in this segment. However, it is only beginning to reflect the true carry potential for this business. There is an opportunity for carry to become increasingly significant over time, as we continue to put more capital to work in carry-eligible funds. Touching on Capital Markets and Principal Activities, fee-related earnings were $23 million for the quarter, up 7% from last quarter, but down 50% from the third quarter of 2011, which benefited from over $800 million of syndicated equity. Third quarter ENI in this segment was $261 million, driven by 5% appreciation on our balance sheet investments. Year to date, our balance sheet investments are up 22%, significantly outpacing the 2.5% appreciation at this point last year. The continued growth of our balance sheet results in $9.82 of book value per share, up 6% from last quarter. This is another record quarter for our book value, and in total, our book value has increased 20% since the beginning of the year, including a 75% increase in unrealized carry, to $733 million. On a cash basis, we had a strong quarter of realizations, driving total distributable earnings of $333 million for the quarter and a distribution of $0.24. Scott will review our exit activity in more detail later on, but the Alliance Boots transaction and the sale of units deal led to a record $0.15 of cash carry in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect two realizations to benefit the next quarterly distribution. First, the most recent Dollar General secondary settled just after quarter end and we anticipate the impact to the distribution from fee paying co-invest vehicles to be about $0.2. We also announced a $2.50 special dividend at HCA. Half of our investment is held in the Millennium Fund, and it should result in cash carry of about a $0.01. Also, given the significant realizations that we’ve had so far this year, the accrued tax distribution is currently north of $0.35 per unit. The ultimate size of the tax distribution will depend on the results for the reminder of the year. Since cash carry remains a big focus for many of you, I wanted to provide an update on netting holds and the progress we’ve made since last quarter. As we’ve mentioned, we refer to the netting hold as that aggregate amount by which any private investment in a fund is marked below cost, net of cash profits from sales of other investments in that same fund. We are able to pay out cash carry when investment is realized, as long as the fund is marked above costs in total and the netting hold has been built. It’s important to remember that most of our active private equity funds are not subject to a preferred return, with NAXI being the exception. Back in July, we disclosed the size of the 2006 Fund netting holds. At the time of our call, the domestic partnership netting hold stood at approximately $1 billion and the 2006 Fund overseas partnership netting hold was filled after factoring in the proceeds from the Boots transaction. Additionally, Europe II’s netting hold, pro forma for Boots, was about $1 billion. Today, the 2006 Fund continues to accrue carry because it is marked well above cost, 1.4 times costs at the end of the third quarter, or 3 times on a realized and partially realized basis. When you adjust the netting hold at September 30 for the realization activity since the end of the third quarter, the 2006 Fund domestic partnership netting hold has decreased from $1 billion at the time of our last call to about $550 million today. As you’ll recall, netting holds can move in both directions and this was the case in the 2006 Domestic Fund this quarter. The overall reduction was driven by the realized gains from both the September Dollar General secondary and the HCA special dividend, but offset this was a markdown in Samson this quarter from cost to 0.8 times costs, which increased the netting hold by about $150 million. Turning to the 2006 Fund overseas partnership, this vehicle paid $0.10 of carry in the third quarter from profits associated with both Boots and the Unisteel transaction. Therefore, 2006 Fund Overseas is in a cash and position and currently has approximately $5.8 billion of remaining value. Moving onto Europe II, at the end of the third quarter Europe II is marked at 1.2 times costs and continues to accrue, but not pay, carry. As of September 30, the netting hold on this fund has been reduced from $1 billion to about $850 million. The big driver here was a write-up of KION, where an expected infusion of capital from a strategic investor increased our valuation from 0.4 to 0.9 times costs. In summary, we feel really good about the progress across all of our funds, especially 2006. Today, we are generally paying cash carry on $16.5 billion of private equity remaining value, which includes the $5.8 billion in 2006 Overseas. We are also getting closer to paying cash carry on the other $20 billion, and remember, none of the historical private equity capital is subject to a preferred return. I’ll now pass it over to Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. When we think about the third quarter, we see five main things of note. The first is our distributable earnings growth. Craig touched on this earlier, but we’ve had a strong cash earnings trajectory in our business. Let, me give you a few statistics. Our total distributable earnings for all of 2010 and 2011 were $740 million and $780 million respectively, of which 35% and 25% came from, realized balance sheet gains. When we factor in all of the activity year to date, including the realizations since quarter end, our distributable earnings so far this year are $1.2 billion, so we’re only 10 months into the year, and we’re already 60% higher than 2010’s full year results and 50% higher than 2011. The second area worth touching on is our level of monetization activity. Since our last call, we’ve been very active on the exit front, benefiting from both strategic and capital markets activity. On the strategic front, four main things happened in the third quarter. First, step one of the Alliance Boots sale to Walgreen’s closed. Second, we sold Unisteel to a strategic buyer for close to two times our cost, marking the first full exit from our Asian private equity fund. Third, Tempur-Pedic has agreed to buy Sealy. And finally, we announced that a Chinese power company has agreed to make a strategic investment in KION. Since quarter-end, we announced two monetizations through the capital markets. A few weeks ago, we executed our fifth Dollar General secondary in the last 13 months, all of which were priced at higher valuations than the last. With this deal, we’ve now realized cumulative proceeds of approximately 3.5 times our cost. Including the shares we still own in the company, our investment in Dollar General is valued at 4.8 times. We also announced another special dividend at HCA. Including this dividend, KKR has received cash proceeds from HCA of greater than 1.5 times our cost, and including the stock we still own, our investment in HCA is valued at 3.9 times. Through these exits, we’ve returned $4.2 billion of cash to our private equity funds and carry-paying co-invest vehicles since June 30, and $7.5 billion so far this year. In aggregate, our private equity funds on page 20 of our press release are currently marked at 1.6 times costs and, on a realized and partially realized basis, 2.7 times. And more importantly, all of our private equity funds are valued in excess of cost today. The third item of note is fund raising. We’re pleased with the $10 billion of traditional private equity capital we have raised year to date. $6 billion of the $10 billion came from the first close of NAXI back in the first half of the year, and we got the $6 billion faster than we would have thought. We then focused our attention on the Asia II fund raiser and have seen significant interest in that fund. With another close of Asia II now behind us, we’re focused on progressing with our pipeline of accounts for NAXI and we expect a final close of $7 billion to $8 billion of capital when fund raising concludes next year. Regarding Asia II, recall that last quarter we announced a $3 billion first close which is also faster than we would have originally thought. We’ve seen interest grow and are now at $4 billion of capital raised to date. We’ve set a hard cap for the fund at $6 billion, including the GP commitment, and we have a strong pipeline. The first Asia Fund continues to perform well and is currently marked at 1.7 times. As a reminder, we raise capital for private equity in three different geographic areas: North America, Europe and Asia. This is a bit unique, as most firms have global funds. So to understand how much capital we have for private equity, you need to aggregate the individual geographic pools. Year-to-date, we’ve closed on $10 billion of capital in North America and Asia, and that excludes our $6 billion Europe II Fund, our $1 billion China Growth Fund and the $2 billion of remaining dry powder that we have for investments in our 2006 and Asia funds. When we look at what this means for our business in aggregate, the key takeaway is that we have $19 billion of capital for our global private equity franchise so far. Of the $19 billion of total capital, about $16 billion is dry powder, so we have a significant amount of capital for our global private equity business and we haven’t finished fund raising for NAXI and Asia II, which will continue to increase these amounts. The fourth area of update is real estate. Building out our non-private equity businesses remains a priority for the firm and our real estate franchise is a good example of this. Since our last call, the team has been involved in three investments, which have been funded through a combination of our North American private equity fund, capital from the balance sheet and KKR Financial. This is still a nascent business for us, but we’re seeing great early traction and a strong global pipeline of opportunities. The last area we want to touch on in Prisma. As Craig mentioned earlier, we officially closed the Prisma transaction on October 1. Prisma’s assets continue to grow at a healthy rate and are now $8.1 billion, which is up from when we announced the transaction in June. Investors have awarded Prisma $800 million since the announcement of our transaction in June and $1.4 billion since the beginning of the year. We see real value in the combination of KKR’s global footprint and Prisma’s focus on providing customized solutions to clients, and we’ve been very pleased with the support of Prisma’s clients and the market for the combination. Pro forma, all else being equal, the inclusion of Prisma in our numbers would increase our assets under management from $66 billion to $74 billion, and our fee paying assets under management from $50 billion to $58 billion. Looked at another way, Prisma increases our Public Markets AUM by 50%, from $16 billion to $24 billion. So when we look at the quarter, there are few things to take away. We’ve had continued strong investment performance. Our private equity funds are up 20% year-to-date and we continue to see strong performance in our non-private equity businesses. We’re giving cash back to our investors through both strategic exits and capital markets exits, and there’s more on the horizon. We’ve had good fund raising momentum, leading to record AUM and fee-paying AUM. And we closed Prisma, our first ever acquisition, which gives us a great platform in the growing hedge fund business. All of this together has yielded record ENI of $1.8 billion for the first nine months and significant cash back to all of us as shareholders. Here is another way to look at it. In the first nine months, our balance sheet investments have generated $1 billion of earnings and are up 22%. Our non-balance sheet efforts, between carry and fee-related earnings, have generated income of about $800 million. In aggregate, this is $1.8 billion of earnings on an average $6.3 billion of book value. So another way to think about our results is that we have generated a return of 28% on your and our book value in just the first nine months of the year. Thanks again for joining the call. And we’re happy to take any questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer: Two things. I wanted to first just make sure I understood the hand-off between the base management fees on – with the NAXI and the 2006 Fund. So if I just go back to the 2006 Fund there was $17.6 billion earning 125 basis points, so that’s roughly $220 million on an annualized basis. And you now say that 2006 is about $12 billion at 75 basis points, so that would be $90 million. And then we add $5.9 billion for NAXI at 140 basis points; that’s somewhere around $80 million or $85 million, so that would add up to about $170 million on an annualized basis. So if that’s all that happens then it seems like your base management fees would step down by $10 million or $12 million. But then, if Asia II, with $4 billion comes in at say 125 billion, that would be about $50 million. So when it all turns on, it seems like it should be a wash. Am I doing my math correctly?
Bill Janetschek: You are, but you’re a little off, only for the fact that when you think about the $17.6 billion fund, we weren’t collecting a fee on the entire amount because first, you have to back out the GP commitment, and then don’t forget, there was a significant, significant commitment from KPE when the original transaction took place and we actually weren’t receiving a fee on that capital. So it’s really going from $15.1 billion down to $12 billion. So on a blended basis it’s $15.1 billion at 125 basis points going to now $12 billion and a little more than $12 billion at 75 basis points. And then right now, based upon the numbers we just walked through at $5.7 billion at 140 basis points. But keep in mind, we’re continuing to raise capital for NAXI. And as long as we receive commitments by December 31, the way our documents work, is we’re going to be able to accrue the management fee for that signed commitment all the way back to October 1. So the way to look at it is, right now, all things being equal, we’re probably going to be, maybe in the fourth quarter, down a couple of million dollars for the quarter, assuming that we don’t raise any capital and we’re not assuming that at all. So any capital you raise would bring us closer to just being relatively flat, which is what I said on the last quarterly call. Now two, and you hit the nail on the head with Asia. When you think about it, Asia is a $4 billion fund. We’ve already got signed commitments for Asia II of $4 billion. So as it goes from Asia to Asia II, that fee is the same. So all things being equal, the management fee will be flat. The big benefit, though, is Asia goes from the investment period to the post-investment period, and roughly, we have about $3.5 billion, or will have, of invested capital in that fund, where we’ll get a, receive, a 75 basis point fee. So that’s going to be very accretive, once Asia goes from the investment period to the post-investment period.
Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer: And do we have a estimated time line on when that happens?
Bill Janetschek: My guess would be, that would probably be first quarter, maybe second quarter of 2013.
Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then secondly for me, I guess, I thought KION was an interesting case study, and there was a transaction announced in August. And what we know from the public record is that you bought KION initially for $4 billion, according to press reports, and it was marked down to, I guess, pennies on the dollar at one point. And the transaction from the press release that KION had, it looked like the market value of the equity at the terms of the investment was about $2.3 billion, but now it looks like you have it marked on your balance sheet slightly above cost. And so I wonder what pretty pieces of the puzzle am I missing there and could you walk us through how that transaction worked and how we came to have this marked up at where it is now?
Bill Janetschek: Sure. Generally, we don’t comment very specifically on how we build up our valuation for any particular portfolio company, but I just want to give you a couple of snippets to think about when you’re trying to walk from I think what you think the KION value is on that strategic investor coming in and where we’re carrying it right now. And you could see that if you look at the co-investments where we have KION right now and where we’re carrying it is about cost.
Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer: All right.
Bill Janetschek: Last quarter we were carrying it at 0.4 times. The one thing to keep in mind is this strategic came in and only is buying a 25% interest in KION, and it was part of a more significant transaction where they also came in and bought 75% – sorry, 70% of the hydraulics business. So it was a combined transaction, and although we used that information in coming up with our valuation, we didn’t put total weight on that. In addition, keep in mind that this transaction didn’t close in the third quarter. It’s expected to close in the fourth quarter, and once that transaction does close, we’ll probably see a slight uplift in the carrying value of KION in the fourth quarter.
Chris Kotowski – Oppenheimer: All right. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Bill Janetschek: Thanks, Chris.
Scott Nuttall: You bet, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Scott Nuttall: Yeah. We can hear you.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Okay. Great thanks. The in NAXI 140 basis management fee, I understand why that’s higher than the prior one, I guess, because you have the hurdle rate now. Do you view that as a premium to sort of what others are getting in the market? Because it’s – it seems that competitors are, for a general purpose private equity fund, are typically more like 125 basis points?
Bill Janetschek: No Roger, I mean, the difference between where we were in 2006 and where we are in NAXI is that when you raise the size of significance like the 2006 Fund up to a certain amount, we were charging 1.5% and over a certain amount then we were charging a reduced rate. So on a combined basis, based upon the capital that we actually did raise of the $17 billion, the blended was 1.25%. For NAXI, we aren’t at that peak rate right now and so the total amount of fees that we’re going to be receiving is the 140 basis points that I referenced. And I would say that if you look at other managers in this space of equity being raised, or commitments of that size, 1.5% is market.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess that kind of leads to the second part of the question, which is, I guess, you mentioned that commitments up till December 31 will accrue management fees from October. And I guess the question is why wouldn’t someone wait until January, then? What changes? I mean, does the fee rate change, or what?
Bill Janetschek: No. What’s going to drive an investor to invest – and there are investors that are looking at investing in NAXI will be, when we’re actually going to be closing that first investment because the way our documents work is that if you’re not committed in the fund when the first investment is made, you actually don’t – you don’t get that investment.
Scott Nuttall: And Roger, it’s Scott. The only thing I would add to that is in a lot of instances, limited partners will have a certain budget that they need to allocate within a calendar year. So that may drive people to get something done before the end of the year. But I think also really the impetus is now in place, because recall in the last call, we said that the NAXI fund had not turned on. It has now turned on. So there, to Bill’s point, are transactions that will be getting done in the NAXI fund, and I don’t think people are going to want to miss those.
Bill Janetschek: And just to be clear, because I want to make sure that based on what Chris asked earlier, if an investor waits until December and they close in December, they’re going to pay a full quarter of fee.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Right.
Bill Janetschek: Just like someone who is already in the fund today.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Right. Okay. Then sort of my last couple of questions here. In the Public Markets, actually, can you give us an update on how the long/short team is doing? And secondly, just sort of strategically with Prisma now, when you look at your footprint across sort of liquid market space, do you think you’ve kind of got what you need to build from there, or are there holes at this point?
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Roger, it’s Scott. I’ll take those. The long/short equity team has been doing well. It’s been a tough year for long/short equity generally in the hedge fund space and our team outperformed the market, and so we’ve been pleased with the performance. As you know, we’ve only been in that business for a bit over a year. We just passed, not long ago in August, our one year anniversary. So we’re pleased with the performance. Frankly, we’ve been focused on getting investment performance, as opposed to scaling the business, so the overall size of capital we manage is somewhere between $400 million and $500 million today. But we’ve been really pleased with the performance, especially the last several months, where we’re continuing to gain momentum. And so more to come on that in future quarters. In terms of Prisma and the footprint, I think we’ve now got, between Prisma and KES plus our liquid credit businesses; we’ve got a significant amount of capital, $20 billion plus in liquid investments and liquid alternatives. So we’ve got real scale across equity and credit today. And I think there is more to do. I think, when you look at the amount of capital rotating into liquid alternatives, there’s a lot of opportunity for us remaining in that space. You know that we’ve launched, or are in the process of launching, a high-yield mutual fund, some closed-end funds, we have our private BDC that we’ve talked about in prior quarters. So we think there’s a significant amount of opportunity in liquid alts, and we continue to look for teams to continue to build the firm out reasonably organically, and then also potentially for acquisitions as well.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Kim with Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Kim – Sandler O’Neill: Hey, guys, good morning. First, just in terms of fund raising more broadly, how are you thinking about potentially coming to market with small or more specialized strategies versus the bigger regional private equity mandates that maybe give you a bit more flexibility to invest where you see the greatest opportunities? I suspect it’s a bit of both, but how do you see that balance playing out going forward?
Scott Nuttall: Hey, Michael, it’s Scott. Look, I think it’s a great question and I think balance is the right word. So, if you think about it, we do have our three big geographically focused private equity funds in North America, Asia and Europe, but if you think about what we’ve been doing more broadly as a firm, we have been building out a series of other strategies that are each more modest in size and more specialized in focus.
And so just to name a few: China Growth Fund, which we raised not that long ago, obviously focused on smaller investments in China, minority investments in particular. We’ve got the Infrastructure Fund, which we closed earlier this year. We have our Natural Resources Fund, which is a very specific targeted, focused investment area in conventional oil and gas. We have special situations. We have direct lending. We’ve got a recently launched energy income and growth fund, which is yet another strategy in oil and gas, broadly defined. So our view, right now, is we like having both. We like having the kind of flagship bigger funds, but we also like the specialized focus of these smaller funds, diversifies our bets, allows us to invest behind our ideas and each of those businesses with performance, we think, gives us an opportunity to scale pretty meaningfully. And, as you know, in our business, if you have good performance and the investment opportunities are there, Fund II and III can be meaningfully larger than Fund I. In addition to that, we’re doing specialized separate accounts for other opportunities to access some of these interesting investments around the world.
Bill Janetschek: Right. And just to add on, I mean, if you take look at page 20, the special situation vehicles, we’ve raised, in public markets, about $2 billion. And so those vehicles are fee-generating plus carry-generating, and those are based upon investor demand. And let’s not forget also on the Public Markets side, we also have the Mezzanine Fund that we closed on about two years ago...
Michael Kim – Sandler O’Neill: Got it. And then, maybe just a follow-up on the realization discussion. Can you talk about what you’re seeing out there in terms of the IPO market versus strategic sales, versus secondary sales and dividend recaps? Is it fair to kind of expect more on the secondary sale and dividend recaps going forward, just given kind of the market dynamics?
Scott Nuttall: I’d say, Michael it’s going to be a mix of all of those. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’ve seen more strategic sale activity the last 12 months than we’d seen in the prior 36 months plus. So there has been more strategic activity. It is going to be a bit lumpy as to when it happens, but the nice thing with a strategic sale is you can often get all your capital out. So it’s quite efficient. I do think we’ll see some more of that; it’s just very hard to predict how much will occur. And so I think the primary place where we can control outcomes is on the secondary front. We do have a meaningful amount of our portfolio, 30% give or take, in more liquid investments – the HCAs, Dollar Generals, Nielsens, et cetera – where we have already taken a company public and have started accessing the public market through secondaries and dividends to get cash back to our investors. I think you’ll see more of that. Dividend recaps we’ve done relatively selectively, and there’s just been a couple of situations in the past where we’ve done it, and we’ll look at those from time to time.
Craig Larson: Michael, just to add on on that, it’s Craig, this is actually a very good example from a dividend recap, which Bill has touched on, but we will look for those credits that are modestly leveraged, that generate meaningful free cash flow and tend to be more mature businesses. So if you think of HCA in that framework, it obviously generates significant free cash flow and is leveraged very reasonably, given both its cash flow profile, as well as relative to its peers. And the other point on HCA is when you think of the most recent dividend recap, it’s actually pretty modest from a leverage impact. HCA has about 440 million shares outstanding, EBITDA of over $6 billion, so a debt-financed special dividend of $2.50 a share would actually increase the debt to EBITDA figures by less than 0.2 of a turn. And the second point on the dividend front, which is actually interesting, which I think is just worth touching on, is related to that is the strength of leveraged credit markets, and they certainly have been very strong. I think you saw some of that in terms of the incentive fee that we received this quarter in the Public Markets business. But its strength is also we’ve seen beyond straight dividend recaps and the like. We’ve actually been very active working with the portfolio companies to take advantage of the market conditions to refinance indebtedness within our portfolio where it makes sense. So in the third quarter alone, we actually refinanced over $14 billion of debt, and that’s roughly half of what we’ve done year to date. So again, that’s just another point related to this topic that’s worth thinking off.
Michael Kim – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.
Craig Larson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Hi, everybody.
Craig Larson: Hi Howard.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Scott, I just wanted to return to NAXI for a minute, if I take a step back the secular tailwinds of underfunded LPs and wallet share consolidations seem to be intact, pretty happy about the improving performance of the portfolio, and you’ve distributed $7.5 billion over the life of 2006 Fund. So if I add all those factors together, I guess, I’d thought you’d ultimately land the fund size above $8 billion and we’d see a progression to the $6 billion from earlier this year. Did I overrate all those positives, or is there some other disconnect that you all are seeing out there?
Scott Nuttall: I think you’ve characterized it reasonably well, Howard, terms of the overall backdrop. But what I would tell you that the $6 billion close that we got to in the first quarter; we did get there reasonably quickly. And then, frankly, a lot of our investors started to focus on the Asia II Fund, and we had a significant amount of overlap in terms of our investor base between those two geographic areas and I think, just given how their internal processes work, some of them decided to work on Asia ahead of NAXI. And now what’s going on is they’re kind of got that work done. We’ve got to $4 billion in Asia. And remember, we launched that at the beginning of this year. So that happened much more quickly than I would have anticipated. And so if you’re looking back at the beginning of the year, I would have thought we’d have a bit more for NAXI and reasonably amount less for Asia. It just happened to be that Asia got more traction much more quickly than anticipated. And now that we’re through the investment period for 2006, the focus is returning to NAXI while people finish their work on Asia II. So, I wouldn’t take any big great message from it. And the $8 billion, I gave $7 billion to $8 billion, maybe we can do better. We think $7 billion to $8 billion is a reasonable range, based on what we see today, but we have through early next year to finish the fund raising process. But if I ask you to even go higher up, kind of 20,000 feet, if you think about capital that is allocated to buyout funds, it’s quite cyclical. And so in 2006 and 2007, there was $450 billion committed to buyout funds, and last year, that number was about $70 billion. And so when we think back to the 2006-2007 period, and think about raising capital for larger scale funds in this new environment, it’s a completely new world. And so, to Bill’s point, we raised about $15 billion of third-party capital for the 2006 Fund and that $15 billion compares to about that $450 billion that was committed in those two years, so about 3%. And if you look at what we have raised between NAXI and Asia II, it’s $10 billion so far, and relative to the amount of capital that’s actually been invested, the $70 billion last year and a similar number this year, our market share in terms of what we’re actually getting committed to KKR versus the rest of the market has gone up considerably. And so you’ve got that broader backdrop in which we’re all operating.
 :
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: That’s all really helpful context. Thanks for that, Scott. And just staying on fund raising for a minute, and shifting over to the Public Markets, the performance across the multiple public market strategies continue to look really good. I realize some of these strategies are newer for you all, but just given all of what you just said, how do you think about scaling up each of those major strategies and really ramping up the external fund raising with the other timeline that you have for the other major funds?
Scott Nuttall: Sure, let’s maybe take it in pieces. So if we focus on Public Markets first, we’ve got two components of our credit business that’s worth commenting on. One is what we call the alternative credit businesses. So you’ve got the mezz business, which is in the process of investing its first dedicated mezz fund and so far, to your point, the performance has been great. And we’ll seek to raise a second fund here in the not-too-distant future depending on deal flow. But we feel good about our ability to scale that business. That’s going to be an episodic fund kind of business.
 : So I think with between mezz, special sits and direct lending, we see a lot of opportunity as we get to Funds II, III, IV, to have quite a bit of growth, and, frankly, not a lot of change on the expense side, because we’ve invested ahead of revenues. When I move to the liquid side of credit, we manage about $12 billion, give or take there today. We have been competing for institutional mandates and winning our fair share. That is an area where, frankly, you need to have multi-year track records and we’re anniversarying some of our track records, which is quite helpful in terms of being able to get in the finals pitches, and I think we can continue to scale in high-yield and loans. In the institutional side, we’re also spending time with high net worth investors across the credit platform. And then, as I mentioned, we’re starting this retail effort, which we think the liquid credit strategies are perfectly suited for, and our first two strategies there are going to be focused on high-yield and closed-end funds. And you can see how we’ve grown the AUM and fee-paying AUM in the Public Markets business; a lot of that is just continuing to get traction across these credit strategies. And then as you move to your question on Public Markets, as you move to the hedge fund side of the house, Prisma’s got a lot of momentum and great investment performance, and so our focus is integrating the team and that’s gone very, very well. And as I mentioned, we’re continuing to win client mandates, frankly, ahead of our original expectations. So we see a lot of room for growth, because keep in mind, private equity is about $1 trillion market. If you aggregate everything we’re doing in credit and hedge funds, it’s about a $4 trillion market. So we have a significant amount of room to run here.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great, thanks for that, Scott. And then, just finally from me, you’ve been helpful on the past to just highlight the continued high single digit revenue and EBITDA growth that you’re seeing in the portfolio. From all the data that you and the team compile, how are you seeing those growth rates progress in a lower GDP environment? And can you just give us a flavor for what the team is doing to think about and drive like the next leg of value creation and EBITDA growth? Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Well, just to give you a quick update, we do track it every quarter. So our private equity funds, on a global basis, the businesses that we own, revenue growth of about 7% last 12 months and EBITDA growth of about 9%. And that’s how we look at, which is weighted by where we have dollars of that exposure on the equity side. I would say in terms of color, U.S. operating environment is not great. We’re kind of bouncing on the bottom. Some weeks it feels a little better than that, some weeks it feels a little worse. But the overall economic backdrop is uncertain, to say the least. And so we’re encouraging our management teams to focus on what they can control and invest for the future. In some cases, we’re making add-on acquisitions and we’re investing to take market share from our competition, with a keen focus on managing expenses and keeping efficiencies up. But overall, to the economic backdrop, more the same; just kind of blah. Europe, frankly, looks a little tougher lately. We’ve had good outcomes. We – actually, the European portfolio EBITDA has held up really well. The growth in the value of our European portfolio this year is marked up 38% year to date for our European private equity portfolio. So the companies have held in there well, but if you really look at what’s going on, we have exposure in Northern Europe, which has been reasonably well insulated. We have very little exposure to Southern Europe, and so that’s served us well. But having said all of that, harder to get revenue growth, more headwinds the last few months than the prior six. It’s just a more difficult operating environment generally. Asia is a bit of mixed bag, frankly; some headwinds in China as we’ve seen that economy slow a bit. Overarching comment though, if China’s GDP growth is 7% versus 9%, 7% is still pretty good. And we’re focused on areas that are not export driven. So think of local consumer – consumption-led businesses, the kind of growing middle class. And so our businesses, we think, are well insulated, but a little bit slower, but nothing that we’re all that anxious about, and the businesses across Asia seeing significant organic EBITDA growth, kind of teens kind of numbers. So overarching comment is it’s a bit of mixed story, but in terms of what we can focus on, which is driving the performance of our companies, 7% top line, 9% bottom line, private equity funds up 20% year to date, and we’re continuing to see real operational value creation by focusing on investing into some of the dislocations.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks for taking all my questions, Scott.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs: Hi, everybody, it’s Marc Irizarry, Goldman Sachs.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning, Marc.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs: Good morning, guys. I just want to go onto, back to NAXI for a second. Scott, can you talk a little bit about sort of the mix of LPs in that fund that you’re seeing and the sort of re-up rate? And then I have a – and how that compares to some of the other strategies, if there’s a difference in terms of re-up rate and also the LP mix? And then the pace of commitment seems a little bit, maybe a little bit, maybe it’s happening a little bit faster, it seems like, maybe the outlook is that things are going to pick up. Are you sensing that velocity of money in sort of large cap LBO and private equity world is becoming more of an issue, i.e., maybe the J-curve effects are playing a bigger role, and how LPs are thinking about putting money to work in alternatives?
Scott Nuttall: Sure. I’ll try to tackle both of those, Marc. I think in terms of NAXI, look, we’ve had a very nice re-up rate, which is what led us to kind of the sizable first close and relatively quick first close that we had. As we sit here today, about 27% of the LPs in that fund are new to KKR, and so when you have a new investor, it tends to be smaller, so it’s about 10% of the capital, but about 27% of the LPs. If you compare that to Asia II, as an example, those numbers are 38% of the LPs in Asia II so far are new to the firm. So, and that’s also 10%, 11% of the capital. So we’ve been very happy with the re-up rate and frankly, we’ve also been happy that we’ve been able to gather new clients for the firm and build new relationships. It’s just that they tend to start out smaller when it’s a new relationship and so we’re seeing that dynamic a bit. But I would tell you it’s really quite pleasing to us that we’ve got several clients that have been with us for five, 10, 20, in some cases 30 years, that have come into NAXI, and in a lot of cases Asia II, as well. In terms of the second question, about what we’re seeing and the broader question about large cap LBOs, I think it’s continuing to evolve. We’ve seen this in our industry over the course of the last 20 to 30 years that there tend to be situations and times like these after a period where larger funds get raised and it takes time to get cash back. Investors feel flush, they wonder about when they’re getting their cash flows back, so the allocations to new funds get smaller. And so we’ve been working our way through that period as an industry. Obviously, Asia, as we talked about, with $4 billion in our first fund and capping the second one at $6 billion, that’s maybe an exception to what I’m saying. But North American buyouts, frankly, what we’re seeing is I think more and more cash going back to investors than they would have anticipated a year ago and that’s going to cause people, over time, to allocate more to the space again. And so I think number of people have taken a wait-and-see kind of approach, and I think with valuations continuing to increase and cash flow continuing to increase back to them, we’ll see more allocations starting to occur. So I think this is viewed by us here as really just part of the cycle that we’re used to living in and over time it will just continue to play out. And the other thing I would say is the way we think about it, we do not get as stressed, given we’re used to that cycle. So if you think about how our business works, if NAXI is smaller than 2006, then NAXI will get invested more quickly, and then we’ll be out raising a successor to NAXI that much more quickly. And also, we have our capital markets business which allows us to, frankly, get economics on third-party AUM, but doesn’t actually show up in the fund. So we feel pretty good about the backdrop, and as long as we keep performing and giving cash back, we’re optimistic about where we’re going.
Bill Janetschek: And Marc, just to give you an idea on cash back to the LPs, Scott mentioned earlier that the capital we returned to our LPs this year is roughly going to be about $7.5 billion, based upon information we know right now, and that number was $6 billion last year. So we’re returning capital to our investors. And just one other point: keep in mind that three or four years ago, when we were in the cycle of raising capital, we didn’t have our client and partner group. And now we’ve got a client and partner group of, a dedicated team, and they’re about 40 strong right now. So as Scott said, it’s cyclical, so when we actually enjoy the cycle up, when we have that team to go out and raise capital, the amount of capital that we have the opportunity to raise is going to be higher the next time we go through the top end of the cycle.
Scott Nuttall: And Marc, one more thing, just to see you have the backdrop, the other thing we are seeing is a continuation of the trend of investors consolidating their relationships. And so I think we’re going to see more capital allocated to alternatives and they’ll want to do more with fewer, and that’s why, frankly, it’s very helpful, as we sit here today, to have several things to talk to them about – PE, credit, hedge funds, energy, real estate, et cetera.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs: And then just to follow on with that client and partner group, is your distribution sort of fully integrated, if you will, in terms of the ability to sort of cross out all those products?
Bill Janetschek: It is fully integrated, so we have one team that focuses across all of different product areas, including working with their colleagues at Prisma, and we track this in terms of how we’re aggregating new clients and our cross-sell statistics, and those are continuing to improve: we’re at 1.7 average products per customer. Interesting thing is if you look at the top 25 clients, there are 3.6 products per client, so we’ve got a lot of opportunity there on the cross-sell front.
Marc Irizarry – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.
Robert Lee – KBW: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott Nuttall: Good morning.
Bill Janetschek: Hey Bob.
Robert Lee – KBW: I was wondering if you could maybe go back – going back to Prisma and update us on how we should think about some of the flow-through of some of the financial impact as it relates to fee-related earnings and potential carry. I’m going to work on an assumption that, to the extent it can generate performance fees over time, that a lot of that will accrue to the existing staff. Could you maybe just kind of work us through some of the structure and how we should think of it financially?
Scott Nuttall: Sure, Robert, it’s Scott. We haven’t disclosed much about the Prisma transaction or the economics of that business, but just to give you, something to work with, so, as I mentioned, third party AUM, a bit over $8 billion at the end of the quarter. And if you look at the kind of revenue economics associated with the business, it is not going to be a lot different than other hedge fund to fund businesses out there. So think, on average, 80 to 90 basis points all in, in terms of total fee, both incentive and management fee revenue, to assets. So it’ll give you a little sense about how to think about the top line. Highly profitable business; it was actually structured in such a way that the team didn’t keep its incentive fees per se. What happened is that all kind of gets consolidated into KKR and then they have a big earn-out over time that will allow them to participate in the performance of the business in that manner.
Robert Lee – KBW: All right. Great, that’s helpful. And also, just want to see if I could – just to make sure I understood some of the Asia Fund fee dynamics, Bill, and it – when Asia I flips to kind of its – I don’t know, I guess I’ll call it harvesting phase, it goes to a 75 basis point fee on fair value. Is that correct?
Bill Janetschek: Remember, our funds, traditional private equities, are either based upon committed capital or invested capital so...
Robert Lee – KBW: Right.
Bill Janetschek: It could be based on invested capital.
Robert Lee – KBW: Okay.
Bill Janetschek: So if we fully deploy $4 billion, and let’s assume that we sell – and we have sold some investments off of Asia as of today -that number, when the crossover occurs, is about $750 million of costs returned to our LPs, we’re going to be collecting a 75 basis point fee on the $3.25 billion.
Robert Lee – KBW: All right. Great. Actually, that was it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Bill Janetschek: Sure
Scott Nuttall: Thank you, Robert.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Hi. Just one follow-up. I’ve listened to your answer to Marc’s question couple minutes ago. This notion of investors, this time circular, waiting to see money, capital returned, and then re-upping. Is that – with your close on NAXI coming up next year, I guess, first quarter, is sort of the assumption there in your minds that you’re going to have a reasonable amount of realization and capital distributions over that time period to kind of get some of those – maybe some of larger investors over the hurdle?
Scott Nuttall: I wouldn’t necessarily take that message. I think there – we are optimistic over time about giving more cash back. But what I would say, Roger, is that a lot of the events that we’ve had year to date, frankly, have given them more confidence that there’s going to be more good outcomes and liquidity coming off the portfolio, and that has helped kind of have the focus go from Asia back to NAXI a bit. So they understand that there is quite a bit of upside in the 2006 portfolio, we believe. And the other thing that’s, frankly, been the impetus is what I said about just turning on the fund. So now, actually, there’s a reason to move because they’re missing deals. And so I think it’s more of the combination of the residual effect of all the cash we’ve been giving back, plus the fact that they’ve actually got a reason to make a decision in the near term.
Roger Freeman – Barclays: Okay. Helpful. Thanks.
Scott Nuttall: Thank you.
Operator: I’m not showing any other questions in the queue. I’d like to turn it back over for closing comments.
Craig Larson: Thanks, Sean. We’d just like to thank everyone for joining and thank you for your interest in KKR. We’ll speak to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to KKR's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to Craig Larson, Head of Investor Relations for KKR. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Larson: Thank you, Cynthia. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by Bill Janetschek, our CFO; and Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. We'd like to remind everyone that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements, and we'll also refer to non-GAAP measures on this call which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. This morning, we reported quarterly economic net income of $546 million compared to $747 million last quarter and $315 million in the second quarter of 2011. This translates into $0.74 of after-tax, economic net income per unit, more than double what we earned in the second quarter of last year. The big driver of our strong results was a 5.1% increase in the carrying value of our private equity investments this quarter, which outperformed the S&P 500 and MSCI World Indices by about 800 and 1,000 basis points, respectively, and an even greater appreciation in our balance sheet investments, which were up 7% this quarter and 16.5% year-to-date. Over the first 6 months of the year, our private equity portfolio has appreciated by about 14.5%, meaningfully ahead of the S&P 500, which is up 9.5%, and the MSCI World Index, which has increased approximately 6% year-to-date. We're happy to review with you 3 exciting pieces of news for the firm. The first of these is the strategic partnership between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, in which Walgreens will acquire a 45% stake in Boots, creating the first global, pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. This transaction is a great reminder of how meaningful strategic exits can be for us, and while our work is certainly not done here, we think this is a wonderful first step. Bill is going to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact that this transaction has on our financials. In addition, there are 2 strategic events this quarter, which we're excited to review. First, as announced in June, we've agreed to acquire Prisma Capital Partners, a leading provider of customized hedge fund solutions. And second, this morning, we've announced the formation of a partnership with Stone Point Capital to help further our third-party capital markets efforts. Scott will provide more detail on both of these strategic initiatives and their growth opportunities. Finally, before we move on, I want to touch on something that we introduced in our last earnings call. We've decided to provide additional detail around our distributable earnings metric. As we have defined and reported this metric historically, it has excluded income generated from the balance sheet since it has been our intention to reinvest that capital in the business. However, as we've seen some investors focus on this metric across the industry, distributable earnings under our historical definition did not represent the total cash earnings profile of our franchise, as any realized gains from the $5 billion of investments on our balance sheet would not be reflected in our reported distributable earnings. To help better frame this, we've introduced 2 new lines in our press release. You can find them at the bottom of Page 6. The first is net realized principal investment income, and it includes realized investment gains from our principal investments, net of any realized losses, plus dividends and net interest income. This, combined with our legacy distributable earnings, equals the second new line, total distributable earnings. With the new disclosure, we hope to reflect the overall cash earnings profile of our enterprise on a comparable basis with others in the industry. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk you through the drivers of our performance and give an update on netting, and then we'll have Scott discuss the environment and what we've been focused on across our different business.
William J. Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. Our assets under management was asked $61.5 billion as of June 30, down slightly from both last quarter, as well as the same time last year. Our AUM was positively impacted by the appreciation of our investments and the capital we've raised in the quarter. But this was offset by large distributions to our LPs as we continued to monetize our private equity portfolio. We ended June with over $47 billion of fee-paying assets under management lagged from last quarter, but up 2% from a year ago. The year-ago increase was driven by capital raising in both the Private and Public Market segments. These figures do not factor in almost $11 billion in capital raised through closings to date from our first close of our North America Fund; our first close in Asia 2, which occurred this quarter; the portion of the Texas Teachers' mandate that has not yet been allocated to specific funds; and some other vehicles that pay fees only when capital is invested. Turning to our segments. In Private Markets, fee-related earnings were $36 million, down slightly from both last quarter and last year. We do not have any termination payments this quarter, which are generated by portfolio company exits and can therefore cause spikes in our fee-related earnings. In the first 6 months of 2011, our fee-related earnings were augmented by $40 million of net termination fees associated with Seven Media, HCA and Nielsen, and this is the main reason for the year-to-date decline of fee-related earnings. The 5% write-up in our private equity portfolio outweighed lower fee-related earnings in the quarter, translating into ENI of $175 million. This is up over 35% from the second quarter of 2011 but down from last quarter when our funds were up 9% compared to 5% this quarter. Touching on Public Markets. Fee-related earnings were $12 million compared to $15 million last quarter and $21 million last year. The decline versus the prior period was driven by lower incentive fees, which more than offset any increase in management fees as we continue to grow our fee-paying capital in this segment. Moving to Capital Markets and Principal Activities, fee-related earnings were $21 million for the quarter, up 5% from last quarter and up 20% from the second quarter of 2011. Despite the lower level of private equity transaction activity we're seeing, our Capital Markets business still performed quite well. We have benefited from this business's global footprint. About 1/3 of our revenue this quarter came from outside the U.S. Additionally, almost 40% of revenue was derived from our third-party initiatives. We reported ENI of $365 million in this segment, driven by the performance of our balance sheet investments, which appreciated by 7%, outperforming our portfolio by 200 basis points. The outperformance of our balance sheet relative to our portfolio is largely due to the significant appreciation in Alliance Boots, Dollar General and HCA, where the balance sheet had additional exposure through its co-investments. This strong performance translated into book value per unit of $9.28 at the end of June, up 7% from last quarter and the highest book value figure we reported as a public company. In total, our book value has increased 14% since the beginning of the year, including a 57% increase in unrealized carry to $660 million. Total distributable earnings were $406 million for the quarter, which is the largest it has been in any quarter since we went public, up $570 million year-to-date, up 27% from last year. As Craig mentioned earlier, these numbers now include income from our balance sheet. Total distributable earnings have more than doubled since last quarter and last year as we have started to see significant sales from investments on our balance sheet. This translates into $300 million of realized balance sheet gains in this quarter alone, which we plan to reinvest in our new business initiatives. Keep in mind, this $300 million does not include the impact from Alliance Boots, as that transaction has not yet closed. This was an active quarter for us on a realization front, and our distribution benefited from carried interest we received from these exits. We fully exited Hilcorp and also closed on the sale of the El Paso joint venture. Because of the type of income these investments generate, they were structured in separate investment vehicles in the '06 Fund, so we were able to pay cash carry. In addition, we earned some carry from co-investment accounts that invested in Dollar General alongside the '06 Fund. Approximately $0.02 of this distribution relates to these accounts. We also completed a Nielsen secondary offering at around 2x our money, which is in the Millennium fund and therefore generated cash carry. In total, this translated into $0.06 of cash carry for the quarter, marking the ninth consecutive quarter where we've seen cash carry in the distribution. That carry, combined with $0.07 of fee-related earnings, equates to a distribution of $0.13 per unit. Given the significant realizations we've had so far this year, the tax distribution that we would pay based upon activity year-to-date would be approximately $0.20 per unit. In addition, the first step of the Alliance Boots transaction will result in about another $0.10 a unit. So if there were no other realizations for the rest of the year, except for Alliance Boots, the year-end distribution would be at around $0.30. This figure can go up or down between now and year end, but given the size of the number, we thought that it was worth giving you an update on where it's been based upon what we know today. And now on to netting. Since the timing of cash carry remains the topic where we know there is a lot of interest, I wanted to give you an update on netting holes and the progress we've made since last quarter's call. As we explained last quarter, there are separate partnerships in the '06 Fund for domestic and foreign investments, each of which have their own netting hole. As a reminder, we refer to the netting hole as the aggregate amount by which a fund investment are marked below cost, net of cash profits from sales of other investments. Back in April, we disclosed the size of the '06 Fund's netting holes. At the time of our call, the domestic partnership netting hole and the overseas partnership netting hole stood at approximately $1.3 billion and $125 million, respectively. Remember, none of our active private equity funds have preferred return. So as long as a fund is marketed above cost in total and a netting hole has been filled, we are able to pay out cash carry when the investment is realized. Let's walk through how this applies to the '06 Fund. The '06 Fund continues to recruit carry because it is marked well above cost, 1.4x our cost at the end of the second quarter, but 3.5x on a realized and partially-realized basis. However, as of June 30, there's still some netting holes to be filled due to write-downs and certain investments in the funds. The domestic partnership netting hole has been reduced from $1.3 billion to about $1 billion when you factor in all the activity this quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by the gains from the June Dollar General secondary offering. To put that in perspective, the '06 Fund's remaining public positions at June 30 prices were valued at $3.3 billion. $2.5 billion of the $3.3 billion is profit, so we have a $1 billion hole versus $2.5 billion of embedded profits in our public investments alone. If we sold just 40% of the public positions, the domestic netting hole would be filled. And remember, this doesn't factor in the privately-held companies that make up about 2/3 of the remaining value in the '06 Fund domestic investments. Turning to the '06 Fund overseas partnership, the netting hole was slightly north of $100 million as of June 30. The netting hole, however, does not reflect the impact of the Alliance Boots transaction, which we expect to close in the third quarter. Given questions on this transaction and the potential impact that this could have on netting, I want to give you a little more color on this. If you apply the expected cash proceeds from step one of the Alliance Boots transaction, not only would we fill the '06 overseas netting hole on June 30 evaluations, but we'd have approximately $500 million of excess gains. So we'd actually pay out about $100 million of carry, or about $0.08 a unit net of the carry pool. In addition, we have some carry-paying co-invest vehicles that are invested in Alliance Boots, from which we would earn about $0.02 of carry. In short, if step one of the Alliance Boots transaction closes, we would not only fill the '06 overseas netting hole, but we would expect to pay out a total of approximately $0.10 of cash carry per unit, and we will have returned approximately $2 billion of cash back to our investors. We also wanted to help you think about netting as it relates to our second European Fund or Europe 2, since the fund is now valued above cost. At the end of the second quarter, E2 is marked at 1.1x cost. It is therefore accruing, but not paying cash carry. As of June 30, the Europe 2 netting hole is approximately $1.3 billion. And if you included the expected proceeds from step one of the Boots transaction to this fund, the number would be reduced to about $1 billion. In summary, we feel good about our continued progress across our funds and remain focused on increasing the percentage of our assets that are in position to generate cash carry, distributable earnings and ultimately, cash distributions to our unitholders. I'll now turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. Well, it has certainly been an interesting last few months. As we look around the world, we've seen the U.S. consumer pull back, European sovereign concerns continue and slowing growth in Asia. This economic and market backdrop is tough to navigate, but it is providing us with compelling investment and business development opportunities. Like past quarters, I thought it'd be helpful if I take you on a quick walk around the firm to give you a sense of the activity we're seeing across our businesses where you're going to hear a lot of consistent themes from the last few quarters, with a number of transaction and strategic announcements that helped support these themes. Let's start with private equity. If we look across our private equity businesses, transaction activity continues to vary by region. Asia remains busy as our private equity team continues to find attractive investment opportunities. In the second quarter, we invested over $100 million in 2 investments: TVS, a logistics company in India; and China Cord Blood. We also announced an investment in GenesisCare, an Australian medical services company. In Europe, we continue to be more active in the U.K., Germany and northern Europe relative to southern Europe. Last quarter, we closed on $150 million investment in Fotolia, a provider of digital services. Also, since quarter end, we've announced the acquisition of a majority stake in WMS, a German consumer products business. In North America, we announced $100 million investment in Sonus last quarter. Overall though, transaction volumes in North America remained low. CEOs and boards are focused on the uncertain global economy and questions on areas like tax and regulatory reform. We have, however, seen a pick-up in activity over the last few months and are actively looking at a number of opportunities. In addition, the capital markets are open for the right types of transactions, but it remains difficult to predict how many of these deals will actually get done. On the private equity business development front, this past quarter, we established a presence in Latin America, with the appointment of Henrique Meirelles, former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, as a senior adviser to the firm. We believe that his knowledge and expertise will add tremendous value to our global portfolio. We're excited about the prospects for the region as we build out our efforts, beginning with the planned office in São Paulo, Brazil. Now turning to our private equity portfolio. The punchline is we continue to focus on growing revenues and improving operating margins. And on a trailing 12-month basis, the revenue and EBITDA of our companies grew 7% and 6%, respectively. And if you actually weight the performance by the amount of equity exposure we have to each company, revenue is up 10% and EBITDA is up 9%. And the progress we've made at the company level is translating into fund performance. In aggregate, our contributed private equity funds are currently marked at 1.6x cost, and it's 2.8x cost on a realized and partially realized basis. Our funds have appreciated 14.5% year-to-date, significantly outpacing the MSCI World by over 800 basis points. In terms of realizations, we have a saying internally that if our portfolio of companies perform, exits tend to take care of themselves. Dollar General and Alliance Boots are great examples of this. Last month, we executed our fourth Dollar General secondary offering in the last 9 months, all of which were priced at higher valuations than the last, with the most recent transaction at over 5x our costs. This quarter, we also executed some strategic exits. Most significant was the announcement of Walgreen's acquisition of a 45% interest in Alliance Boots. Boots is the second largest investment in our funds, with over $2.1 billion invested in our '06 Fund and Europe 2, plus approximately $400 million in carry co-invest vehicles and an additional $300 million of co-invest from our balance sheet. The company has a strong management team who has driven exceptional performance since the 2007 acquisition, growing EBITDA at a 10% annual growth rate. This is a meaningful transaction for us. Last quarter, we held Alliance Boots at 1.1x our costs. It's a very complicated transaction structure. The bottom line is that this quarter, we're marking Boots at 1.9x our costs. As a result of the transaction being announced but not yet closed, we are accruing income in our financial statements this quarter based on the 1.9x valuation. There are 2 main consequences of this write-up of Boots. The first is that our funds have been marked up meaningfully by $1.6 billion. And when you combine that with the carry paying co-invest vehicles, it's around $2 billion. This results in accrued net carried interest of more than $200 million in the second quarter. The second is that our balance sheet has increased in value by over $250 million. Said simply, Boots contributed approximately $450 million of pretax economic net income in 2000 -- in Q2. This is all on a noncash basis since the transaction has been announced but is not yet closed. We expect step one of the Boots transaction to close in the third quarter, which will have a substantial cash impact in Q3. We expect the 2 main components of the cash impact to be first, a carry distribution of about $0.10 per unit, which we expect to pay as part of the third quarter distribution. The second is significant cash coming back to the balance sheet of approximately $250 million, representing $130 million of realized gain, which will increase both our total distributable earnings, as well as our cash balance. This all relates to step one of the Alliance Boots transaction, and we will keep reporting back over time as we get closer to step 2. We also closed on the sale of the El Paso joint venture to Kinder Morgan this past quarter. This JV, focused on midstream investments, was established in December 2010. And like some other recent private equity energy investments of ours, namely E3 Sources and Hilcorp, was sold at an earlier stage in its life cycle than we anticipated, but at an attractive return. After only 18 months, we sold the JV to Kinder Morgan at around 2x our cost, generating an IRR in excess of 60%. From a fund-raising standpoint in private equity, we've had a $3 billion first close on our Asia 2 fund, a terrific start to a fundraise that was launched back in December of last year, and we remain focused on fundraising for NAXI. Now into energy and infrastructure. Here, we continue to be active on the investment front. Back in April, we purchased proved developed producing properties from WPX Energy in Texas and Oklahoma. We invested over $130 million in this transaction, which was the sixth investment by the KKR Natural Resources Fund, or KNR. In addition, we held closes on our KNR and Infrastructure Funds in the quarter. So at this point, including the funds and the separately managed accounts, we currently manage $4 billion of AUM across these strategies that did not exist 2 years ago. We remain focused on scaling our energy and infrastructure businesses. Most recently, we've created an energy income strategy that will invest in less-developed oil and gas fields plus royalties in energy-related mezzanine transactions, all with a meaningful yield component. Now turning to our Public Markets segment. Our tradable leveraged credit strategies maintained top quartile performance since inception, and our mezzanine fund and special situations vehicles have posted gross IRRs in the range of 13% to 18% since inception. Our solid track record here has enabled us to continue to raise capital, adding an additional $500 million across various strategies this quarter. This includes an additional close for the KKR Lending Partners fund during the second quarter, bringing the total fund size to approximately $300 million. Fundraising dialogue with our investors remains focused on our leveraged credit strategies in back loans and high yield, as well as our special situations and direct lending strategies, in particular. In an effort to further expand our credit platform, we recently announced that we filed with the SEC to offer 2 new products in our Public Markets businesses: a high-yield mutual fund and a closed-end credit opportunities fund. Upon effectiveness, these new products will provide retail investors, including registered investment adviser clients, an opportunity to invest in alternative assets. Our firm's most recent experience in the retail market is with Corporate Capital Trust or CCT, a business development company that we sub-advised which was launched last year. We're pleased with CTT's progress to date as we have seen AUM grow from approximately $250 million at the end of Q1 to approximately $425 million at the end of Q2. We're excited about the opportunities for us to offer our growing suite of liquid alternative products to individual investors. Finally, in our Public Markets segment, I want to spend a few minutes on the liquid alternative space and the Prisma transaction. We've been interested in the hedge fund-to-fund space and expanding our liquid alternatives for several years now. And we think this is a business where you can benefit from having immediate scale. Prisma's $8 billion in AUM will allow KKR to further penetrate the over $2 trillion hedge fund market, which is benefiting from growing institutional allocations. The team's track record is quite impressive, and their ability to deliver strong returns and differentiated, customized solutions to their clients has translated into AUM growth. Prisma's assets under management have nearly doubled since 2009. We feel very good about the deal construct. We expect to pay some upfront consideration, most of which will go to take out AEGON, and all after-tax proceeds received by the management team will be reinvested in the funds and subject to a 5-year lock-up. This ensures a longer-term management commitment and aligns the team's interests with their clients. There's also an earn-out component payable 2 and 5 years after the closing that has been structured to be accretive to the firm. All of this is subject to the transaction closing, which we anticipate in the fourth quarter. The growth avenues Prisma provides are very interesting. It increases our breadth of liquid product offerings, supplementing our current direct hedge fund efforts through KES and our liquid credit products, increased distribution opportunities through introducing Prisma to KKR's client base as well as cross-selling KKR's products to Prisma's clients. Just to give you some statistics. As of July, KKR has approximately 425 clients. When you look at Prisma's client base and focus on the institutional portion, they currently have about 120 clients, and there's very little client overlap with KKR. Just to give you a sense of Prisma's 50 largest clients, only 2 are KKR investors. This cross-sell opportunity which goes in both directions is exciting for us. It just gives us another way to win. Perhaps most importantly, the transaction leverages a strong cultural fit between our 2 organizations. We have a shared vision about how to build our hedge fund platform over time by offering our clients solutions that cut across the entire liquidity and risk spectrum. So as we think about our hedge fund businesses today, we have a direct investing platform that consists of our KES team, which is our long, short equity strategy. We're also analyzing other potential direct hedge fund opportunities. Hedge fund-to-fund is the next part of our platform, and the addition of Prisma is integral to achieving our hedge fund vision. We believe the Prisma team can help identify and diligence other hedge fund teams and platforms for the firm and help us grow in this space. So what does this all mean? Well, our $8 billion in hedge fund-to-funds will complement our existing $16 billion of credit AUM, yielding $24 billion in total AUM in our Public Markets segment. We will now have a scale offering in liquid credit, alternative credit, direct hedge funds and fund to hedge funds, and will be well-positioned to help our clients interested in getting exposure to liquid alternatives. The other recent piece of strategic news is our partnership with Stone Point Capital to capitalize and scale our third-party initiative within our Capital Markets business. We continue to see dislocation in the capital markets as regulatory concerns heighten and markets remain volatile. Dodd-Frank, Basel III, Volcker-- all impact the ability of banks to extend capital. We are committing $150 million from our balance sheet, together with $150 million from Stone Point's Trident V fund to jointly form a partnership to provide capital market services to third-party companies and sponsors to help them achieve their objectives. We will manage and operate the partnership on a day-to-day basis, and we'll share board and governance rights with Stone Point. So it's been a busy quarter. When you look back on all that's happened, we see 3 things of note. First, we've continued to create value within our Private Equity portfolio, which is leading to more carry and more distributions. Alliance Boots is a great example of this and demonstrates the power of carry in our business model. Second, the Prisma acquisition increases our scale and relevance in the hedge fund space, which has been an important part of KKR's longer-term strategy. This development, plus the introduction of 2 investment products for individual investors, will help us further scale our Public Market platform. And lastly, our JV with Stone Point will allow us to further develop our third-party focused capital market efforts in a capital-efficient manner. So against the uncertain macro backdrop, we feel good about the progress we're making and great about the opportunities in front of us. Thanks for joining the call and we're happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You had some great monetizations, and I realize you still have a lot of significant competitive gains associated with those positions, Scott. But how do you think about the next tier of the monetization pipeline? Maybe some thoughts on some of the more recent vintages and how close you see them to an event and monetization?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Thanks, Howard. Look, I'd break it into a couple of buckets in terms of access to liquidity and exits. The first is, we obviously have a meaningfully sized public portfolio and our private equity funds. We have-- about $9 billion of our private equity portfolio is in companies that are already public. Many of which we've already started to execute secondary offerings, so that I think is kind of the most visible form of liquidity coming back. Secondly, and we talked about it on prior calls, we're seeing some pick-up in the strategic activity. Boots is a great example of that, but if you think back, we've had Hilcorp, we've had East Resources, we had -- and we've had Seven Media in Australia. There's been a series of strategic exits. And if you think about our portfolio, we're getting into the more mature phase for a good portion of our assets under management in our Private Equity business. So the transactions that were done, kind of call it 3, 6 -- 3 to 6 years ago are getting to the phase where we can start to think about monetizations. And the reason that we share the EBITDA and revenue growth statistic every quarter is that's what we keep an eye on, because we find that if we can keep growing EBITDA, we're able to find exits for those companies. So it's hard to be precise as to timing, but we feel like we're making progress.
Howard Chen - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Understood. And then my second question, the firm's been less acquisitive than some of your peers. Clearly, Prisma is kind of a change in that. So I'm just curious where else do you see opportunities where it may make sense to do something via an acquisition versus pursue it or de novo.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I think -- just to be clear, it took us about 36 years to do our first acquisition. And so Prisma is the first one we've actually done as a firm and all the other growth we've had has been organic and hiring talent into the firm. Look, the way we think about this, Howard, is we -- if you think about KKR today, we've got our Private Equity platform, we've got energy and infra. We have real estate, credit, hedge funds and capital markets. And as we've continued to look across our platform, really the one scale business we have continues to be Private Equity. Everything else, we have opportunities for meaningful growth. And a number of those businesses have been started in the last few years. So our tendency will continue to be organic growth across those different platforms. But as we look to scale globally across those different businesses, we'll look at acquisitions from time to time, and we will consider growing both inorganically as well as organically. But it's taken us a bit of time to do the first one. There's nothing imminent in terms of a second, but we will look across all those other platforms and see if there's anything interesting out there where there's a good cultural fit and a good strategic fit.
Howard Chen - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. And then finally for me. On Stone Point, maybe I just need to learn a bit more about it. But I'm just curious, what does the JV exactly bring or accelerate that you couldn't do on your own?
Scott C. Nuttall: I think it's a couple of things. One, we were finding a lot of opportunity in the middle market, Howard, to provide capital to both companies and sponsors. Frankly, what we hear from our clients in that space is that the banks have pulled back meaningfully from the standpoint of providing capital. And so as we've been out with our Mezzanine business, our direct lending business and our Capital Markets businesses, we hear that as a recurring refrain. And so the first thing that the JV will provide is dedicated and incremental capital to provide services and balance sheet to that part of the market. So you'll see us underwriting debt, you'll see us underwriting equity, you'll see us providing other services to those companies. A lot of this, frankly, we were already doing as part of KKR. And Bill mentioned 40% of our Capital Markets revenues in the quarter were actually from third parties. But this joint venture will allow us to have a dedicated pool of capital and a dedicated effort against that third-party space. And so we'll be putting $150 million in, we're partnering with Stone Point, and they'll do the same, and we'll seek to grow the business together. I think the other thing it provides us is a great partner. And Stone Point has a lot of access to sponsors and companies in the middle market space. They've built financial services firms over their long history, and so I think they will be able to bring their own relationships and business to bear as we seek to grow the third-party business further. So I think -- well, we view it as an opportunity to have a great partner, have a dedicated effort in the space and really provide more capital and services to the middle market, which is sorely in need of it right now.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just first on the marks this quarter, can you just talk about the different moving parts under the surface as it relates to the public companies, the privates, as well as the Alliance Boots transaction?
William J. Janetschek: Okay, sure, Michael. This is Bill Janetschek. We drill down on the details. When you take a look at our public portfolio, we were actually up about 0.3%. So even though the S&P was down 2.8%, we still, even just on our public marks, over-performed. When you take a look at the private, if you actually excluded Boots, then the most part, our private portfolio would be relatively flat to a little down. So overall, the way to think about it is we got a significant uplift in this quarter from the Boots write-up from $1.1 billion to $1.9 billion, which Scott mentioned earlier, as well as a little bit of an uplift on our marks on our public positions.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Got it, that's helpful. And then more of a bigger-picture question, but as you start to increasingly scale some of your newer complementary businesses like hedge funds, energy and infra, real estate and the new retail funds, how much success are you having getting existing clients to invest with you for a new strategy? Are they comfortable with your ability to generate returns across businesses where you might not have had a track record or historical expertise?
Scott C. Nuttall: Thanks, Michael, it's Scott. We've had quite a bit of success on that front. And one of the things we monitor is, kind of, our cross-sell statistic, which continues to move up. But we've been quite pleased. What we used to do historically, frankly, before we expanded into these newer businesses, it's been 8, 9 years ago now, is we used to just talk to the private equity staff within institutional investors. And what we've done now is we've moved up meaningfully, and now we're talking to chief investment officers, we're talking to heads of fixed income, real assets, equities, real estate, the public side and the private side. And so we've been able to kind of share our expertise and our perspectives with institutional investors in a much broader fashion. And so the conversations have really changed. Whereas before, it was solely PE, now it's how should they think about asset allocation, where is the world going. And we have our macro team, which is spending a lot of time with investors on that. And then we really plug them into all of KKR. And so we've been really pleased with the receptivity of our investor base to several of these newer businesses. And as we've scaled capital across credit, energy and infrastructure, hedge funds, et cetera, we have seen quite a bit of support from that client base.
Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just finally, I haven't talked about it in a couple of quarters, but just can you give us an update on KES in terms of fundraising and maybe some performance trends you're seeing there.
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. KES, the reason we didn't mention, not a lot new this past quarter, Michael. So there's not a lot to report. Frankly, given the choppiness of the markets, we decided a quarter ago to pull back a bit from third-party marketing. As you know, we started with our own balance sheet capital, raised some external capital and then decided, let's just focus on performance. We've been really happy with the performance so far. The team is meaningfully outperforming the equity long short peers in what's been a really choppy market. So as we kind of get back into the marketing mode in future quarters, we'll give you a fulsome update. But our perspective on this is, if we have the performance, dollars will flo,w, and that's really been the focus the last few months.
William J. Janetschek: And Michael, just putting a number on that. Right now, as of June 30, capital that's managed by KES is a little north of $400 million.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bill Katz with Citigroup.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Most of my questions have been asked. But just sort of curious, as you think about where you are now in the life cycle platforms and these external additions plus sort of scaling some of the other nascent businesses, what's your thought process on the growth of fee-related earnings? Is there some still heavy lifting to do on expenses, or should we anticipate a little margin improvement for FRE?
William J. Janetschek: Well, I'll tackle the expense question first, and then maybe I'll slip it over to Scott as it relates to the revenue growth. But if you take a look on where we've been on expenses, year-to-date, we're actually, for the first 6 months, down slightly. And that's with, remember, bringing on a lot of people in 2011 and 2012. So we've been pretty deliberate on managing expenses. And I don't think you're going to see a whole lot more margin improvement as it relates to expenses. On fee-related earnings, obviously, we've just launched a lot of these platforms. And so when you take into account a few years from now, we're hoping that the second fund is going to be bigger than the first fund. Take for example, Mezzanine Fund or infrastructure. So you know how it works, Bill, in that you have an existing fund. Once you go through the investment period, you're going to receive a post-investment period beyond that fund, as well as then taking on to your fee-related earnings a new fund at an investment period fee. So we hope to see significant growth on the new initiatives that we've launched. Another point is that we've brought on a real estate team, and the goal is to eventually launch a fund. Right now, there's no income being generated from the real estate team as it relates to fee-related earnings. But again, we were optimistic that we're going to be raise a fund and bring that strategy online, and that will actually increase fee-related earnings as well.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes. Bill, it's Scott. I guess the way I would think about it is we've invested a lot in establishing these new platforms. So we have a significant amount of expense running through our income statement with the associated revenue not there yet. So most of that has been done. We are still investing in some areas. We're still focused on building our distribution team. In our Client and Partner Group, we're continuing to look for new direct hedge funds. We're continuing to invest in real areas, like real estate. But I would tell you that I'd say the vast preponderance of the investment ahead of revenues is done. And as we raise first-time funds, and to Bill's point, critically second- and third-time funds, we'd expect there to be positive operating leverage.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's helpful. And so big picture question with the sort of push into retail. Can you talk a little bit about how that came to pass, whether that was sort of a pull-forward from the retail distributors or your decision? And what kind of anticipated growth would you be thinking for in there?
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes. I think it's hard to get specific on growth. Maybe the way I'd characterize it, Bill, the way we think about our strategy for distribution generally is historically, we focused exclusively on institutions. And the way that we think about the world, there's $35 trillion, give or take, of third-party managed assets held by institutions. And so that's predominantly been our focus, in trying to be more relevant to that group. But there's also over $20 trillion in retail hands. And historically, KKR had not spent time talking to individual investors. About 18 months ago, we started a high net worth and family office platform and started the process of actually talking to individual investors directly for the first time. And that has actually proven to be quite successful so far, and so that's been a very good experience. And so that's kind of part 2-- is high net worth family office has been kind of a more recent focus. And we spent a lot of time thinking about the retail space as part of that because the vast preponderance of that $20 trillion that's out there is actually in individual hands. And you've heard us talk on prior calls about why we want to have more liquid alternatives. One of the reasons is it's -- we think it's of interest to institutional investors, but we think it's also highly of interest to individual retail investors. And so what really drove this was our broader thinking about where pools of capital are in the world and what those pools of capital need right now in this very low rate environment and this volatile stock market environment, and we think a lot of the products that we offer in the alternative space could be quite relevant and helpful to those individuals. That's really what drove it. And so this is an initial foray. It is hard to predict where it's going to end up for us, but we think it's a big market, and we're going to work away, and we'll keep giving you updates.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Maybe I missed it, but I wonder if you could give us an update on the commitments to NAXI. In the beginning, you said something like that there was $11 billion of committed funds that is not yet in fee-paying AUM. Did I get that right, and is that including NAXI, or what was that?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Chris, it's Scott. The $11 billion that we referenced was really made up of 4 components. The first is the $6 billion initial close that we had announced in NAXI earlier this year. Then there's the $3 billion first close that we had for the Asia Fund. The third component, the $1 billion or so of the Texas Teachers strategic partnership, has not yet been committed. And then the fourth component is a kind of accumulation of a series of mandates that we have where we don't get paid economics until the dollars are actually invested. And so think of that as committed funds, and as we make investments, the fees will turn on. And so that's the $11 billion. And then on top of that, once we close the Prisma transaction, there'd be another $8 billion on top of that number. So that's kind of what you can think of as AUM that is coming on a gross basis. But more broadly, maybe across fundraising, generally, I'd say the way we look at the world right now, people want Asia, they want energy and they want yields. So if you think about what's happened this quarter, our energy business, we had KNR and infra closed. We've now got $4 billion in that platform, quite a bit of institutional receptivity to what we're doing in the energy space. Credit, we continue to scale that business, and you can see the fee- paying AUM continue to grow there. So it's all consistent. Our Asia Fund, we had a $3 billion first close after 6 months. It was, frankly, a faster and larger close than we had anticipated. And so just to give you a sense, we're really happy. 45% of the investors in that first close are brand new investors to KKR, period. That's only about 13% of the capital, but it's 45% of the number of investors. So the Asia 2 fund is off to a great start because we've got a lot of folks working behind that. But your question on NAXI, we had our first close in February. We were quite pleased with that first close, given the challenging environment for this type of fund. We have until February 2013 for a final close, and so we're working our way on that. Our perspective is it's a great time to be investing in North American buyouts. But the selling process is a bit prolonged because we're still investing the 2006 Fund. So as investors think about making commitments it's -- there's no rush per se. So there's been no material close in February, and we'll give you an update next quarter. It's just hard to predict where things will end up.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And do you ever have interim closes before the final close, or between the first and the final, or is our next data point in February 2013?
William J. Janetschek: No. The next data point where we'll really communicate a number to you will be for sure on September 30, because on September 30, that's when the investment period will end for the '06 Fund and the NAXI fund will turn on. And so just to give you some clarity on what the fourth quarter is going to look like, we'll report to you what the NAXI number is as of September 30.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And I wonder, so you have about $1.5 billion in uncalled commitments left in the '06 Fund. Do you anticipate that -- is that primarily there for other newly initiated transactions? Or is some of that reserved for follow-on transactions in companies that you may already be invested in?
William J. Janetschek: Chris, this is Bill. You're right. You're referring to -- on Page 19, we've got about $1.5 billion of dry powder in '06. About half of that, we're going to keep for reserve, and the other half, we're going to use to make probably 1, 2, maybe 3 investments in between now and the end of the investment period.
Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, any -- are there any updates you can give us on some of the companies that are marked below cost, either in terms of fundamentals or refinancing efforts on some of them? If you can, you can, but...
Scott C. Nuttall: I don't think there's a lot of incremental detail we can provide, Chris. Some of those companies will be reporting their own earnings in the next couple of weeks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So I just wanted to ask about -- as you think about how to fund future growth beyond -- obviously, you've been busy in the last quarter or 2 and with today's announcement, but how do you think about your balance sheet investments, how mature they are? And could we see another wave of potential future growth once some of those investments get into kind of exit mode, especially from the KPE investments?
William J. Janetschek: Matt, this is Bill. Obviously, if you take a look at our balance sheet, we've got about $5 billion invested in, predominantly, private equity investments. But that percentage has come down quite significantly since we've gone public. Over the next several quarters, we would hope to and anticipate more realizations off our balance sheet, and that would give us more liquidity. But right now, if you take a look at where our balance sheet stands today, we've got about $1.2 billion in cash, and we've got reported commitments in the press release of about $600 million. But when you think about all of the other things we've mentioned either today or on prior calls, where we've committed $300 million to real estate, we made a significant commitment to NAXI, which isn't reported in that number, same holds true for Asia 2, as well as commitment to Special Situations, as well as making a commitment to the energy strategy. That number tallies anywhere in between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. So although on our balance sheet it looks like we're liquid, we are liquid but with a lot of commitments. What I will tell you is that we will -- and we have monitored the liquidity on our balance sheet. And to the extent that if it ever got to a point where we couldn't deploy capital at a very attractive rate of return, we would think about making a tweak to our distribution policy. But for what we've got in the pipeline right now, we don't think that, that policy is going to change anytime soon.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.
Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just sticking with the balance sheet for a second. Can you guys help us understand, obviously, it's a lot of capital that you have at the GP level. In some of the new strategies, do you expect that you'll start off with bigger co-investments than you -- in the new strategies such as real estate? Were you going to start off with bigger co-investments in more your own capital sort of devoted for those strategies? And how should we think about the returns that you can generate on that capital versus returning it to shareholders?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Mark, it's Scott. I think the answer is yes. The newer strategies, we are dedicating more balance sheet capital to them. For example, real estate, we've committed $300 million off the balance sheet ahead of having a fund basically to build a portfolio and start to build a track record in that space. And then we'll go out at some point and talk to third-party capital about joining us in that endeavor. Same thing in energy. We've committed $300 million to a variety of different energy strategies to continue to scale the energy and infrastructure business. And as we've launched new credit funds, you've seen us do the same thing. So we do view the balance sheet as a real competitive and strategic advantage for us, and we've been using it to scale a number of our businesses organically. And it makes a big difference. When you go talk to an institutional investor and you tell them that we're going to commit $300 million, do they want to commit $100 million? It's much more compelling than if we ask them to commit $100 million and we commit $300 million. So we found that it's helping to drive this new business formation and accelerate our growth. In terms of how we think about the returns, we really like the returns we're getting off our balance sheet. I mean, you heard in the first half, our balance sheet's up 16%-plus, and that's just in 6 months. And so we have a number of investments there that are still seasoning. We think there's a lot of upside in those balance sheet investments. And frankly, when we look at the ROE we're able to get from seeding new businesses, if you think about just seeding a new fund with $100 million in capital and if you only raise $1 billion of external capital and you work through the math, the ROE is something like 40% or 50%. And so we really like those economics, both from what we already have and what we're doing with the capital, which is why we're pursuing this strategy.
Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then I guess a question maybe for Bill. I guess we've got a good taste to what the gross AUM will look like in terms of the $11 billion in shadow AUM, if you will. What about the outs from some of the distributions? How should we think about sort of what the fee paying AUM would look like, net of maybe the Boots transaction? How do you sort of enter this quarter in terms of fee paying AUM?
William J. Janetschek: Well, Mark, you are right. When Scott gave you the AUM and fee paying AUM, that is the growth on mind with both the NAXI and Asia 2. What will also happen is when Asia and '06 goes from the investment period to the post-investment period, we're going to be getting paid not on the investment capital rate but the post-investment capital rate, and it will be on just the capital that's invested at that time. And so just to give you an idea on NAXI in particular, when NAXI comes online based upon what we've disclosed to you of the capital raised to date of about $6 billion and the '06 Fund rolling from the investment period to the post-investment period, that will happen in the fourth quarter of 2012. You're going to see fee-related earnings stay relatively flat on that crossover. With regard to Asia, we've already mentioned that we've already raised $3 billion on our first close, and that fund won't actually come online until we invest through the rest of the Asia Fund. And so that could happen maybe in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2013. But there, we haven't sold many investments in Asia. And so the step-down of the assets, of fee paying assets under management isn't going to be a significant drop. And what we are going to do is pick up the entire capital commitment to the Asia 2 in the quarter that, that crossover takes place.
Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. And then the -- when you said flat for the fourth quarter, does that assume the '06 Fund, does that assume that the Alliance Boots cost base is out or that Alliance Boots is out of the '06 AUM?
William J. Janetschek: Mark, I don't want to get too granular on the question. I mean, what I'm saying to you is just directionally, and that would be taking into account the Boots.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I think, Mark, to be really clear, what Bill was talking about is the management fee impact, the revenue impact, of the '06 Fund rolling into the NAXI fund. So we're not suggesting to you that we think fee-related earnings are going to be flat in the fourth quarter. We don't know what they're going to be in the fourth quarter as we sit here right now, given transaction activity is going to drive a lot of that. It's purely a management fee revenue point based on the $6 billion that we've announced and disclosed so far.
William J. Janetschek: Right. And clearly just on the impact from '06 and '06 going from the investment period to the post-investment period and NAXI turning on.
Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. And then Scott, I don't know, can you give us just a little more on Prisma? I don't know if there's any financial details that you could share with us or the transaction itself. Just trying to get a sense, I guess, of-- with all the capital that you do have for at the GP, how you think about the restructuring these deals or sort of what -- what sort of -- what your tolerance is for how much capital you want to spend on the acquisitions?
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Look Mark, we haven't disclosed the details of the acquisition. So I'm not going to be able to give you any economic numbers, per se. But the way we think about it is in some of our businesses, we do think that acquisition can be an interesting way to get some scale. And the Prisma acquisition is one that, frankly, we've been working on for the better part of 2 years. There is a historical relationship between the principles of Prisma and some of the senior folks here at KKR. So there was a real familiarity with the individuals, and frankly, a cultural similarity that made this feel quite good to us. The way that we think that these transactions should generally be structured as with a lot of value on the back end as opposed to a lot upfront. And so that's generally the construct we've come up with. So a lot of the value is in the earnouts, which have been structured to be highly accretive to us. And as we think about growing the rest of the KKR through acquisition, I think you'll find that we'll probably pursue a similar approach, some upfront value but more on the back end so their incentives are in line with all of ours.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just to come back to the-- sort of the cash balance commitments, et cetera. I mean, as you kind of look forward, as the KP investments liquefy, I mean, did you think that the way that you're thinking about this is, is that you'll be growing new funds, et cetera? That eventually, you'll have $5 billion-plus, maybe less, some capital used for upfront payment on acquisitions, but the bulk of that is going to be sitting alongside various funds that you have launched or are launching.
Scott C. Nuttall: Yes, I think that's generally right, Roger. I would say it's probably 3 uses. The first is to seed new businesses and invest alongside our institutional and other partners in our vehicles. The second would be to support the growth of our Capital Markets business, where we do selectively take some capital risk to drive the fee growth. And the third would potentially be to the prior discussion, acquisitions. So I think you'll see the balance sheet probably over time look more like the distribution of our AUM. Right now, it's highly private equity-focused because of the legacy KPE strategy. But over time, I think you'll see it be far more diversified, and our hope is also to start to generate a more recurring yield.
Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay.
William J. Janetschek: And Roger, you've seen that to date from when we went public, I had mentioned this earlier, if you take a look at the components of our balance sheet, we're much more diversified today away from private equity than when we were -- when the transaction closed because I think when we actually closed the transaction, 97% of our balance sheet was in private equity. And now we've provided the details to you, yet you could see that, that percentage away from private equity has increased significantly.
Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right, okay. And then just more broadly speaking on reg opportunities. You mentioned -- and your Stone Point comment kind of reminded me of something I was thinking about with Blackstone last week. Some of the other businesses, traditional businesses within the dealer space, I'm thinking commodities, for example, other structured businesses, are getting a lot tougher, given, particularly, Basel 2.5 and 3. And I'm wondering if any of those types of businesses can be of interest to firms like yours that can be structured inside of funds. And one of the things that Tony James had said, which was a fair point, is that putting a business inside of a fund in a traditional sense, do you have some sets on those? And how do you put an ongoing business into a fund. I'm wondering if -- how you think about that or if you did something you think about and whether you could do it if you could provide some sort of secondary liquidity for investors, either that you would provide or facilitate a secondary market and actually have a fund that just kind of continues to run.
Scott C. Nuttall: Sure. Roger, it's Scott. I think -- look, the way that we think about this, it's frankly consistent with how we think about all of our strategies as a firm. And the first question that we ask is, can we do it well by having it integrated with the rest of KKR? And frankly we're good at. And so providing capital to middle market corporates and sponsors up and down the capital structure is very straightforward, something we understand. We've been providing capital to companies for 36 years. That's something that's right down the middle of the fairway. When you get into some of these more esoteric businesses, different trading businesses, commodities, other things, frankly, it stretches the strategic logic to such an extent that I don't think you're going to see a lot of activity from us there. We're going to continue to stay focused on things that, frankly, go back to those core principles that I mentioned.
Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, helpful. And then on netting holes, just quickly, when you cross those, say, in a European Fund, do you automatically -- do the cash -- does the cash carry automatically kick in? Or is there discretion if you're kind of close but yet over where you decide to hold back on the distributions just to keep a buffer.
William J. Janetschek: No, I mean it's quite mechanical. What we've got is based upon the partnership agreement. When we sell an investment, you take a look at the portfolio. And if any portfolio investment is carried below cost, you have to return capital to our LPs or rather until that number goes to 0. Once you cross over that point, the rest of the profit is going to go 80-20. So we know exactly what the netting hole is each and every fund at the end of each quarter. And as long as we have a realization, we satisfy that netting hole. The remainder goes out 80-20, and that turns into a cash carry.
Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And lastly, you talked -- you mentioned Brazil and establishing spreads there. How are you thinking about that opportunity set? I mean, could we see a Brazil fund in the next year or 2?
Scott C. Nuttall: Hard to predict. It's nothing planned in the near term, Roger. It's -- I think what you'll see us do is invest in that part of the world out of the North American Private Equity funds, and NAXI is predominantly going to be investing in that part of the world for us in the near term.
Operator: We will take our next question from Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: This is -- most of my questions have been asked, but I'm just curious to know with the Alliance Boots transaction, has that at all impacted, or changed or influenced any of the conversations you've had with-- whether it's fundraising and the NAXI or any of the others? I mean, or is it really just kind of that's what the perspective LPs perspective is, so it's kind of business as usual? Or has that somehow influenced how people are thinking about the space and return profiles and opportunities?
Scott C. Nuttall: Robert, it's Scott. I think people were pleasantly surprised, would be my characterization. We've been giving our investors updates on how Boots was performing operationally. But as I said, it was held at 1.1x cost last quarter. It's a 2007 investment, a very large investment. We have been saying for the last several years to our investors that we actually feel quite good about the investments that we made in the 2006 and 2007 period, certainly relative to the market and even on an absolute basis. If you think about Dollar General, HCA, Nielsen, now Boots, we've had a number of very good investments from those periods. So I think they've been pleased with that. The biggest source of capital for Boots was the 2006 Fund. And so as we talked to investors about NAXI, one of the things I mentioned is investors like Asia, they like energy, they like yield. North American buyouts has not been as in favor as some of those other asset classes. But as we've had our conversations continue with investors in NAXI, it helps to underscore the point we've been making to them that we see a big opportunity in buyouts. And so I think it is going to be ultimately somewhat helpful as we continued those discussions and that you've seen the '06 Fund move from 1.3x cost to 1.4x this quarter. And the other thing I'd say is cash back helps a lot in fundraising. And we are giving a lot of cash back to investors, and so we think that will ultimately yield positive results for us over time as well.
Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: And maybe just one follow-up on the energy yield strategy you mentioned. I just wanted to clarify, is that a separate fund that you're out starting to fund raise for, or was that a component of kind of the recently raised -- some of the recently raised energy strategy?
Scott C. Nuttall: This is a newer strategy. It's a bit of a different approach than what we had in KNR. The KKR Natural Resources fund was really kind of more proved, developed producing assets. So think of it as you've already developed the underlying opportunity and you're just extracting the commodity. This strategy energy income is going to be royalties, which is a somewhat different space, and we have a joint venture there that we're so far funding off our balance sheet and through KKR Financial, and also proved undeveloped producing. So think of it as fields that are at an earlier stage in their life cycle, so higher potential returns but meaningful cash yield. So it is different than what we're doing in KNR.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up question from Bill Katz with Citigroup.
William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Tough to think I have one, but I actually do. Actually 2 questions. First is, as you talk to institutional clients, has there been any sort of structural shift in their appetite for alternatives at this point in time? And separately, coming back to your discussion on the balance sheet, and I was just sort of looking through it during the Q&A here. Is there a point-- and I appreciate what Bill was saying about in terms of sort of near-term cash flow needs, but is there a point where you reach that you could actually get to assume a self-fulfilling recycling of GP commitments to the point that you can actually start to transfer some of the yield to unitholders, if you will, rather than sort of early investing into fee-related earning initiatives?
Scott C. Nuttall: Bill, it's Scott. I'd say in terms of the question about structural shift in appetite for alternatives, we think that there is a structural shift. So of the $35 trillion of institutional assets I mentioned that are managed by third parties, by our accounting, about $4 trillion of that is in alternatives. And so we think that we were going to continue to see the other $30 trillion, some portion of that shift into alts. And if that happens, you don't need a lot of shift on a percentage basis to have a meaningful impact on the $4 trillion figure. And so we do think that there's an ongoing structural shift. And on a weekly basis, we're seeing institutions increase their allocation to alternatives as they seek ways to generate return. And that shift to alternatives is broad-based. It's private equity, it's real assets. It's a variety of different credit opportunities. It's real estate, and it's hedge funds. And so we've seen a meaningful shift, and we do think that alternative asset allocations are going to continue to grow from institutions that are already in the space. And frankly, we're also finding that institutions that don't invest in alternatives are starting to. Because they look over the last 10 years, and they have had no return from their public equity strategy and their fixed income bucket maybe has generated 2% or 3% for the last decade. And their liabilities are growing at 8%, and the math doesn't work. So we think that is going to result in a pretty meaningful shift in assets over time, at least as it's relevant to the $4 trillion that's currently in the market. So we're excited about that. And that's why you see us positioning ourselves to get in the way of those close. Because as we look about it around the firm, we've had quite a few offerings in the illiquid space, and now with Prisma and KES and a lot of what we're doing in credit, we've got more offerings in the liquid space, and that's where a lot of the flows are going, we think, in the near term. With respect to your question on the balance sheet, it's hard to predict how things are going to evolve over the long term. Right now, the balance sheet is pretty fully invested and very fully committed and invested. So that is not something that we're thinking about today. But over time, if the balance sheet generates a meaningful yield, and we have, frankly, usage for the capital that aren't as high return as they are right now, we'll consider whether or not it makes sense to pay out some of that yield to investors, but that's down the road. We're not thinking about that right now, given all the opportunities we have to grow at the firm.
William J. Janetschek: Right. And Bill, we talked about this on occasion. Remember, keep in mind that 65% of KKR is owned by KKR executives. So to say we're not focused on this point would be an understatement.
Operator: And gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Larsen, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any closing comments.
Craig Larson: Great. Thank you, Cynthia, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-25 09:00:00) =====

Analysts: Gabe Poggi - FBR & Co. Daniel Furtado - Jefferies Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill & Partners 
Operator: In our natural resources, working interest and royalty holdings are carried at amortized cost under GAAP. For our debt and natural resource holdings are adjusted to estimated fair value and our book value per share is $10.67 or a $0.68 premium to the book value we reported this quarter. For the first quarter our run rate cash earnings per share totaled $0.26 per common share, which equates to an 11% cash return on equity and total net cash earnings per share totaled $0.36, which equates to a 15% cash return on equity. I do want to highlight that our run rate cash earnings per share reflects semi-annual coupon payments on our convertible notes payable on our first and third quarters, which when normalized in a straight-line basis results in run rate cash earnings per share of $0.29 or at 12% cash return on equity for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $0.27, a $0.02 decrease, normalized earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. As we have discussed on previous calls, one of our strategic goals for the past year has been to source low-cost, long-term capital so that we could deploy it accretively when market opportunities are attractive. During the quarter we sourced incremental capital through the issuance of $115 million of 30-year of senior notes that bear interest at 7.5%. This pricing compares favorably to our first 30-year senior note offering we did last November, which was done at a rate 8.38%. We have now raised $374 million of 30-year financing at a blended cost of 8.1%. In addition to sourcing incremental capital through issuing holding company debt, another attractive source of investible cash, given the current credit environment, has been through divesting certain rated tranches we hold in our CLO subsidiaries. During the quarter we generated approximately $32 million of incremental capital through the sale of $42 million face amount of our holdings of Class D notes from our CLO 2007-1 transaction. This sale enables us to redeploy capital that had a sub-4% cash yield based on the sales price we achieved through incremental opportunities that we believe will be accretive to both earnings and cash flows for shareholders going forward. We currently hold an additional $162.5 million face amount of these Class D notes, which have divested at the same price as the transactions we did in the first quarter, would raise an additional $124 million of low-cost capital for redeployment to incremental opportunities. Taking our 30-year debt issuances together with the CLO truancy sales we accomplished in the quarter, we have now generated approximately $406 million of capital with the blended cash cost of 7.6% that we believe we can deploy attractively for shareholders. Next, Mike will take you through the specifics of this quarter’s results. Mike?

Michael McFerran: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today we announce net income for the first quarter of 2012 of $88 million or $0.47 per diluted common share. This compares the net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $77 million or $0.43 per diluted common share. Net income for the quarter consisted of net investment income, before provision for loan losses, of $84.4 million, a provision of loan losses of $46.5 million, other income totaling $78.9 million and non-investment expenses of $32.8 million. Comparatively, net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 consists of net investment income of $90 million, no provision for loan losses, other income of $13.7 million and non-investment expenses of $27.1 million. Then investment income reflects gross investment income of $137.9 million as compared to gross investment income of $136.4 million for fourth quarter of 2011. Interest expense, including interest expense to affiliates, for the quarter totaled $53.6 million compared to $46.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in interest expense is driven by $5.7 million of interest expense for the HR senior note offerings from last November and this past March as well as an increase of $2.3 million in interest expense due to payments on CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A subordinate notes held by affiliates that increased due to the higher cash distributions on these notes during the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. It is worth noting that $2.1 million of interest expense for the quarter relates to $112 million of our outstanding 7% convertible notes that mature this coming July. We are currently holding cash on balance sheet to pay for the redemption of these notes and currently don’t expect to issue any additional debt to refinance them. During the quarter we recorded a provision for loan losses of $46.5 million. I did want to spend some time reviewing this amount and our allowance for loan losses with you. As disclosed in detail in our quarterly filings with SEC, our allowance for loan losses consist of two components; an allocated reserve and an unallocated reserve. The allocated reserve pertains to loans that we have determined are impaired or, put another way, where we believe it is probable we’ll be unable to collect all payment due. The unallocated component of our allowance for loan losses pertain our portfolio of loans held for investment that are not impaired. Our balance of loans held for sale are not included in our allowance for loan loss reserve analysis as they are already carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value. Reflected at $46.5 million provision we recorded during the quarter, our allowance for loan losses totaled $235.8 million as of March 31. Of this amount, $34.5 million reflects our allocated reserve, $241.4 million reflects our unallocated reserve. We estimate the appropriate level of our unallocated reserve by risk stratifying our loans held for investment portfolio into three categories which are loans where we have heightened concern, loans where we have moderate concern and loans where our concerns are low. For each category we apply a range of probability of default and loss severity assumptions to arrive at an upside case, base case, and downside case.  As of March 31, we have loans issued from ten issuers with an aggregate par value of $1.12 billion and an amortized cost of $1.08 billion that we classified as being of heightened concern.  Approximately 88% of the amortized cost balance of loans classified as being of heightened concern, consists of the following holdings: First, $311.4 million amortized cost amount of loans issued by Modular Space Corporation, second, $309.2 million amortized cost amount of loans issued by Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company, or TXU, third, $205.3 million amortized cost amount of loans issued by First Data Corporation, fourth, $69.2 million amortized cost amount of loans issued by Realogy Corporation and, fifth, $60.7 million amortized cost amount of loans issued by Caesars Entertainment Operating Company.  Through review of our loan portfolio this quarter with particular sensitivity to the loans we have designated as being of heightened concern, especially TXU, we determined that it was prudent to increase our allowance for loan losses to $235.8 million, which represents approximately 4% of the amortized cost amount of our higher loans held for investment portfolio.  Another way to think about it, is that of our $235.8 million total allowance for loan losses, $201.4 million is unallocated, which represents approximately 20% of the $1.08 billion of loans where we have heightened concern.  The next topic is our other income for the quarter, which totals $78.9 million. Of this amount, $63.6 million stems from net realized and unrealized gains on investments, of which $43.5 million consists of realized gains during the quarter. Other income also includes $9.1 million of net realized and unrealized gains on derivatives and foreign exchange, of which $4.7 million is from our commodity hedges related to our oil and gas work in interest holdings.  Next I'll review our performance by strategy for the quarter with you briefly. Page 15 of our supplemental presentation, which Andrew referred to in our opening remarks, shows our run rate return on equity and total return on equity by strategy for the first quarter. The total run rate return on equity for the quarter of 6.8% reflects the $46.5 million provision for loan offices we reported during the quarter. Similarly, our bank loan in high yield and mezzanine strategies reflect approximately $46.1 million, and $400,000 of the $46.5 million total provision, respectively.  Next, with respect to our natural resources strategy ROE computations there are two key points to note. First, net investment income reflects our unhedged revenue. As we head to the majority of the production from our work and interest investments, the benefit from the hedges we have in place is reflected in other income, which is included in total rate of return, ROE, but not run rate. This amount totaled approximately $900,000 within the quarter. Second, our returns were negatively impacted from $1.4 million of acquisition costs which is a $69.8 million of working interest we acquired during the quarter. As we've disclosed in the past, acquisition costs related to incremental oil and gas purchases are expensed at the time of purchase rather than capitalized and deferred. Next I wanted to spend a moment reviewing our current liquidity. As of March 31 we reported unrestricted cash on our balance sheet of $526.8 million. Of this amount, $112 million is being reserved for the repayment of our outstanding 7% convertible notes that we repay this coming July. In addition, approximately $142 million is earmarked for identified and/or committed opportunities that are expected to fund during the second quarter. This results in approximately in $273 million of investable capital as of March 31 available for further deployment and excessive opportunities that we've already committed to and expect to fund. Now I'm going to hand this back to Bill.
William Sonneborn: Thanks, Mike. Last year we reached a key milestone in diversifying and lowering our cost of capital through becoming an investment grade company for the first time in the company's history. We leveraged this ratings issue nearly $375 million in 30-year notes at weighted average interest cost of 8.1%. Why is this important? Because we are concerned with the implications of massive global central bank easing. Even setting aside Europe and the long term refinancing operation or LTRO, U.S. monetary and fiscal policy has been sized at four and a half times what authorities did in this country during the great depression and now total nearly 38% of GDP. When you include actions taken in addition by the ECB and Japanese Central Bank, we felt it was prudent for our shareholders to lock in a long-term fixed low cost of capital in a period in which global interest rates represent negative real returns. We cannot predict whether significant effects will emerge in 2013, 2014 or beyond, but we see substantial inflationary pressures building on the global economy, particularly in emerging markets through wages. Just look at the commodity markets as an early indicator. In addition to lowering our cost of capital and extending the maturity profile, we made great strides in moving our assets more toward our strategic asset allocation targets. As we have previously shared, we have felt it prudent to balance our financial assets consisting predominately of corporate credit with real assets, natural resources and commercial real estate. While a majority of our exposures will remain focused on opportunities within credit markets, we believe that we can achieve very attractive and consistent cash flow and total rates of return in real assets while improving risk adjusted returns in aggregate to our shareholders. We currently are targeting approximately 60% of our capital to global credit opportunities, 20% to natural resources and 15% to commercial real estate with the remainder to other opportunities including some modest private equity. At last year we executed on several transactions through our growing natural resources strategy and deployed our committed deploy over $210 million of capital. We have continued this phase of activity into 2012 including additional capital deployed or committed to be deployed during the first quarter to acquisitions of overriding royalty and working interests in oil and gas properties as well as a commitment to a consortium alongside Schlumberger and Tech Petrol, which will redevelop and provide service and optimize production of certain wells in Ecuador and returned for a fixed dollar fee per barrel of incremental production produced. In addition, earlier this month we announced our investment in Yorktown Mall outside of Chicago. We're excited about the current pipeline of opportunities we are working on within commercial real estate. Shareholders may ask why we have created such substantial exposure within these real assets to natural gas as part of our natural resources strategy. The answer is supply and demand. We believe it is only a matter of time before natural gas becomes more of a global commodity such as gold or oil. While the U.S. has tremendous supply, areas such as Europe, Japan, China, Korea and India will likely have even bigger demand. It's not difficult to see the attractive arbitrage opportunity in buying 20 plus years of natural gas at a spot price of $2/mcf when global markets price it at much higher premiums. In addition, because of our propriety sourcing and use of hedging and ability to add operational improvement, even with natural gas prices down 56% for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2012, we have generated attractive risk-adjusted returns through this strategy to our shareholders. But even with all that deployment, we ended the quarter with $527 million of cash. We're almost $415 million net of our $112 million of convertible bonds maturing in July.  Again, shareholders might ask, "What is management doing with all that cash?" The answer to that is simple. It's not a surprise because we believe that Greece will likely default again within the next 12 months. It's also not a surprise since Greece has been in default the majority of the time since 1800. We also believe that global sovereign debt imbalances will continue to substantially shorten credit cycles relative to what we've experienced in the past from historic averages of two to three years to even short periods like six months.  We are focused on driving returns for our shareholders and the best time to have capital is the same time that it is hardest to obtain. We are ready. We expect a substantial opportunity to deploy this cash to very attractive returns in the near future. We did this in August and September of 2007 when markets dislocated and we did it in May of 2010, both of which have resulted in very good returns for our shareholders, some of which have been realized in the first quarter. We believe we can do it again. In addition to pulling capital, we continue to deliver substantial total and cash returns to shareholders. For the first quarter of 2012, a return of equity was 20% and our total cash return in equity to shareholders was 15%. Our current strategy for capital deployment is born through the philosophy that different asset classes will provide differing risk-adjusted return profiles across changing macro and micro economic cycles. Ultimately we are focused on opportunities where we believe our manager has a pronounced and defined competitive advantage to which we can continue to drive returns for our shareholders. With that, we'll open this call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: In the case of your question on capital appointment and the first quarter was an interesting one which we kind of met our pace in terms of deploying capital. We had raised in the context of the November debt offering. But because of the strength of credit markets, we were able to realize on a number of investments we had made in previous quarters prior to raising that debt offering at attractive prices where we felt those assets had the chief fair value. So, what you see is effectively a recycling, if you will, of capital deployment in accordance with what our plan was based upon the pipeline with realizations, taking advantage of what the market gave us. And so, as we've said today we have a pretty attractive pipeline, as Mike went through, in the context of a number of investments that we will expect to deploy in the second quarter and we're waiting with some good dry powder for the next turn in the context of market volatility event which we expect will happen in the near future and we want to be ready for it.

And so, as we've said today we have a pretty attractive pipeline, as Mike went through, in the context of a number of investments that we will expect to deploy in the second quarter and we're waiting with some good dry powder for the next turn in the context of market volatility event which we expect will happen in the near future and we want to be ready for it.
William Sonneborn: In the case of your question on capital appointment and the first quarter was an interesting one which we kind of met our pace in terms of deploying capital. We had raised in the context of the November debt offering. But because of the strength of credit markets, we were able to realize on a number of investments we had made in previous quarters prior to raising that debt offering at attractive prices where we felt those assets had the chief fair value. So, what you see is effectively a recycling, if you will, of capital deployment in accordance with what our plan was based upon the pipeline with realizations, taking advantage of what the market gave us. And so, as we've said today we have a pretty attractive pipeline, as Mike went through, in the context of a number of investments that we will expect to deploy in the second quarter and we're waiting with some good dry powder for the next turn in the context of market volatility event which we expect will happen in the near future and we want to be ready for it.
Gabe Poggi - FBR & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. One quick follow-up because you guys are obviously, seeing as evidence by what you've done over the last two quarters a lot of pitches to hit in natural resources on the commercial real estate side. Do you think, just from 20,000 feet has KKR's or KFN's vantage point from the commercial real estate perspective turned the corner? Are you seeing better pitches to hit there? Is there more flow, more Yorktown-esque opportunities as compared to call it nine months ago or a year or so ago, as you guys talked about increasing equity allocation to that asset class?
William Sonneborn: Yes, as were getting closer to see MBS maturities and interesting enough you have this weird dynamic going on in commercial real estate between very, very low cap rates in traditional core real estate and very, very high cap rates when you go 20 miles outside of city center in the context of things that need some operational enhancement. And so, where we're seeing much more activity in terms of our pipeline is in those opportunistic situations where, again, we, through the managers’ competitive relationships, can drive some enhanced value creation at those properties as a major source of return. And that pipeline has continued to build both domestically and internationally.
Gabe Poggi - FBR & Co.: That's helpful. Thanks guys, good quarter. And thanks for the color on the provision.
William Sonneborn: Thanks, Gabe.
Operator: And from Jefferies we'll now go to Daniel Furtado.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Morning, everybody. Thank you for the time. I'm sorry if I missed this but the detail on the OpEx increased, can you help me to understand the movement from 4Q to 1Q and how to think about that going forward?
Michael McFerran: Sure. When we acquire a working interest in for our natural resources strategy, acquisition possibly related to those are expensed rather than capitalized and amortized over the life or natural life of the asset. That is just really a function of GAAP as acquisition of oil and gas working interest is treated as business combinations.
William Sonneborn: GAAP follows cash basically there. So, you will see lower initial returns and then much higher returns once you get through the initial acquisition cost being expensed. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Got you. Thank you. And then the other question is did something occur in the first quarter that made you adjust your probability and severity outlook assumptions for these "heightened" concerned loans or was this an inclusion of additional loans into that category?
Michael McFerran: There was no change in the category. We continue to look at that portfolio, while we are hopeful for good outcomes, we thought it was prudent to increase it. We are conscious that we did see some of TXC's bonds get downgraded during the quarter and price declined and some of its loans were as witnessed.  But all in all, we felt, especially as Bill referenced in his comments, we are going to be entering an environment where concerns are on Greece and sovereign debt. It could create some choppy waters. We felt it was better to strengthen the balance sheet with additional reserves before that period is experienced.
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Got you. Okay, thank you. Then one more, quick one if you don't mind? This $150 million debt issuance, is it safe to assume that no interest was recognized in the quarter from that issuance?
Michael McFerran: No, interest? No, we accrued interest expense from, I mean it was a small allowance from the date we did the deal in March through the end of the quarter, but it was a small amount. There was no cash interest expense on it. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Okay, okay. Great. Thanks a lot for your time, I appreciate it. 
William Sonneborn: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will go next to Michael Sarcone with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Hey, good morning, guys. 
William Sonneborn: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: First question on the allowance, again. I know things can change over time and situations can get worse, but do you feel like this resent provision you took in the increase in the allowance, is that really a kind of very worst case scenario you've built in there or could you foresee another allowance build?
Michael McFerran: I think, look, worse case is definitely a hard statement to make, so I wouldn't want to go that far. I mean, 4% of our entire portfolio is reserved for it, which people look at historical performance leverage loans, feels pretty prudent to us. We feel very comfortable with that reserve level.  But that being said, I wouldn't want to make any statements because, frankly, I don't have a crystal ball on how the future can play out.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: No, I understand.
Michael McFerran: We feel good with where we're sitting today. 
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Okay. And then can you just give us an update on what you are seeing in the CLO market, you're thoughts there and the potential for any new transactions?

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-09 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the KKR & Co. L.P. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Larson. Please go ahead, sir. 
Craig Larson: Thank you, Rachelle. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO, Bill Janetschek; and by Scott Nuttall, Global Head of Capital and Asset Management. 
 We'd like to remind everyone that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our SEC filings for cautionary factors related to these statements, and we will also refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release. 
 This morning, as you may have seen, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings. A few highlights. Our fee-related earnings were $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus 2010, and for the full year, fee-related earnings increased 31% to $417 million. Our fourth quarter distribution is $0.32 per unit. This includes $0.09 of realized cash carry and our fourth quarter tax distribution. 
 Beyond delivering strong operating results, we also had a very busy quarter on the new investment front across all of our segments. This ranged from the $7 billion acquisition of Samson Resources, which ranked as the largest private equity-backed transaction in 2011, to our infrastructure, China Growth and Mezzanine funds and to our special situations business, which continues to be busy, particularly in Europe. In total, we completed over $27 billion worth of transactions in 2011. 
 We thought, though, we would begin with a topic where we know there is a lot of interests, fundraising. We're happy to announce that we've continued to raise capital since year end, principally from 2 areas. The first of these is the initial close of our 11th North American private equity fund, referred to internally as NAXI. We are now at the $6 billion mark, having closed on over $5.5 billion of commitments at this point and with expectations of at least another $500 million in the near term, subject to documentation. 
 This is only the initial phase, and while we are limited by private placement rules in elaborating further, we think $6 billion is a great start. It adds to our $40 billion of existing private equity AUM and brings dry powder to over $13 billion after only the first close on this fund. 
 Second is the strategic partnership with the Teacher Retirement System at Texas, which, we're pleased to say has now been finalized. We were selected to manage $3 billion of TRS capital across a variety of asset classes within our Private Markets segment and our alternative credit strategies within our Public Markets segment. In a few minutes, Bill will walk through how NAXI and the TRS strategic partnership impact our financial statements, and Scott is also going to spend some more time on our fundraising initiatives, including the launches of 3 new funds across our Public and Private Markets segments. 
 Before we move on, I also want to bring your attention to an upcoming event. On March 12, we'll be hosting an investor presentation focused on KKR Capstone, our team of operational experts and how Capstone differentiates our Private Markets investing platform. We'll put out a press release beforehand with information on the live webcast. We hope you'll be able to join us. 
 And one additional note about the distribution. The record date is supposed to be February 21 and not the 20. We'll be confirming this publicly later today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill. 
William Janetschek: Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. Our continued progress in raising capital and building out new businesses drove a 31% increase in fee-related earnings in 2011 to $417 million. We've now organically grown our fee-related earnings by nearly 70% since 2009. 
 We also reported gross distributable earnings of $196 million, our highest quarterly number as a public company. Our fourth quarter fee-related earnings of $117 million was our second best as a public company. Remember, this doesn't include fees on the new capital we've raised since the end of the year. 
 Our PE funds, which are the biggest drivers of ENI today, since they make up most of the carry-generating balance sheet assets, were up 2% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. This compares to 2010 appreciation of 11% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the full year. Because valuations appreciated less in 2011 than in 2010, you saw a decline in our ENI both for the quarter and the year. 
 If our public companies alone had been valued on December 31 at the stock prices they closed at yesterday, our ENI for the quarter would've been an additional $300 million or approximately double what we've reported. But remember, this is just a point-in-time estimate. 
 Relative to the market though, our 4% growth for 2011 compared to a 5% decline in the MSCI World Index, so our full year performance reflects 900 basis points of outperformance. And if you look back over the last 2 years, our portfolio was up 36% versus an increase of just 7% for the MSCI World. So in short, the outstanding performance on fee-related earnings, much of which came through IPOs and continued transaction activity, was somewhat masked by a less significant mark-to-market appreciation, meaning less mark-to-market carry and less balance sheet investment income. 
 On a cash basis, strong fee-related earnings and a strong quarter of modernizations drove gross distributable earnings up 24% year-over-year. This led to our largest quarterly distribution as a public company, $0.32. And it's important to remember that this is before some of our big funds are paying cash carry and in a realization environment that still hasn't fully normalized since the financial crisis. 
 As a reminder, our distribution policy is to retain gains on our balance sheet assets so we can reinvest in our business. But since those gains may generate flow-through taxable income to our unitholders, we do make a year-end distribution to cover the estimated tax liability associated with this flow-through income. This portion of the distribution amounted to $0.13. 
 Our AUM at the end of the year was $59 billion, and fee-paying AUM was $46 billion, both up slightly from the end of last quarter. At year end, our book value stood at $8.29 per unit, including net cash of approximately $500 million. 
 Touching on our segments. In Private Markets, we put more than $3.5 billion of capital to work this quarter, about 50% of which was through our funds. This drove a substantial uptick in transaction fees, leading to an increase in fee-related earnings of 39%, relative to the fourth quarter of last year. As we discussed, ENI was lower, given the more limited increase in valuations this quarter relative to the same time last year. 
 The full year showed essentially the same trends for both fee-related earnings and ENI. Capital deployment and monitoring fee termination payments contributed to a 24% spike in fee-related earnings, even after taking into account the additional costs incurred in building out our business operations, fundraising and real estate teams. 
 Moving on to Public Markets. This quarter, fee-related earnings and ENI were more modest than in the same quarter last year for 2 reasons: first, we've continued to invest in the build-out of our newest strategies. The KKR equity strategy team joined us from Goldman Sachs, at the start of 2011, and we've also been expanding our special situations platform. Second, we earned a smaller incentive fee at KFN. However, management fees were up 27%. This was driven by the significant new capital raise in the business over the last year at attractive fee rates and with potential to generate future carry. Looking at the full year, we grew total fees in the segment by about 22%, with the roll on of management fees from these new strategies, but this was largely offset by expenses associated with building out those strategies, many of which are just beginning to raise capital and generate fees. 
 In Capital Markets and Principal Activities, KKR Capital Markets or KCM, had a record-breaking quarter and year, generating its best quarterly fee-related earnings and 66% growth for all of 2011. The team's equity syndications effort did more than just drive fees, they also facilitated our ability to add attractive new investments to our portfolios. 
 On the Principal Activities side, we saw an increase in the value of our balance sheet investments but to a lesser degree than last year. As a result, other investment income declined for both the quarter and the year. 
 I thought it would help to discuss the impact recent fundraising will have on our financials. Remember, the fee-related earnings growth I've gone over is all before you factor in the inflows we've recently announced. For NAXI, we expect that in the fourth quarter, we'll begin accruing an investment period management fee. All third-party capital in the new fund will be added to fee-paying AUM at that time. At that point, the management fees on the 2006 fund will step down to 75 basis points on remaining costs. 
 Regarding Texas Teachers. As we've mentioned, the partnership is focused mostly on our Private Markets segment, with some allocation to our alternative credit strategies. Some of those dollars have already been committed. $1 billion of the $3 billion is already accounted for in our AUM and fee-paying AUM. The simplest way to think about the economic impact of this partnership is that over time, additional AUM and fee-paying AUM will show up in our figures as the partnership makes commitments to new funds we raise. And given the recycling provisions in this relationship, we would expect the total $3 billion in -- to grow as we perform. 
 I'll now pass it over to Scott. 
Scott Nuttall: Thanks, Bill. Hi, everybody. Thanks for being on the call with us today. Now that Bill has taken you through the financial results, I thought I'd take some time to talk about the progress we're making in realizing our vision for the firm. 
 Our view is that the financial and capital markets are changing. Many traditional providers of capital are impaired, but the needs for capital are greater than ever before. This dislocation creates an exciting opportunity for us. So in addition to optimizing the value in and growing our private equity business, we're working hard to invest into the dislocation and scale our newer businesses. 
 Our goal is to be able to invest behind our ideas and partner well with our clients to help them take advantage of the opportunities in the market. To accomplish this, we're working to achieve several objectives. If we do these things well, we'll continue to make progress as a firm, and the financial results will follow. 
 Let me spend a few minutes talking through each. The first goal is creating value for our clients. We feel very good about the progress we've made on this front. Our private equity funds are up 36% in the last 2 years, meaningfully outpacing the Public Markets, which were up 7%. Our funds are currently marked at 1.5x cost, and the realized and partially realized investments in these funds have returned more than 2.8x costs. 
 And our private equity portfolio continues to perform operationally. The EBITDA of our companies grew over 7% over the last 12 months. In addition to private equity, our energy and infrastructure platform continues to perform well, generating mid-teens returns, and our Public Markets businesses remain top quartile performers. 
 The second goal is monetizing investments when it's sensible to do so. Here, even with the volatile market conditions we all experienced in 2011, we had a great year. We had over $5 billion of realizations in our private equity portfolio in 2011 at an average of 2.4x our invested capital, and more than $9 billion of realizations over the last 2 years at an average of 3.4x invested capital. 
 Approximately 30% of our portfolio or $9 billion is now in public stocks, which allows us to exit more readily. We're also seeing strategic exits start to pick up, with 5 sales to strategics last year. In Public Markets, we've been taking gains when it's sensible to do so and locking in attractive returns for our partners. So overall, cash back is a good story for us. 
 The third goal is to source attractive new investments. Here, we had an extraordinary year. We see this as a good environment in which to be investing capital, and we've been investing aggressively. We closed on $26 billion of new private markets investments during the year. Total equity in these transactions was $13 billion, of which over $4 billion came from our funds and the rest was syndicated to various partners. 
 In private equity, we announced or closed on 16 new investments in 2011, including 6 growth equity investments, 7 LBOs, 2 joint ventures and a corporate carve-out. We also began investing out of our Infrastructure Fund, where we've now competed 4 investments. 
 In Public Markets, we also had a busy year, investing more than $1.1 billion through our Mezzanine and special situation strategies, and the level of activity continues to increase as we take advantage of the pullback of traditional lenders. 
 Our fourth goal is to monetize more of the content we generate. An important part of our vision for the firm is to be able to invest behind our ideas in scale and when we source a transaction, be able to retain as much of the economics on that transaction as we can. Building adjacent investment capabilities allows us to do that. 3 years ago, if we sourced an infrastructure investment, we had nowhere to make the investment. Now we have over $2 billion in dedicated funds through which we've been able to act on our ideas. This is now the case in energy and infra, liquid credit, alternative credit, real estate and public equities. So we're acting on far more of our ideas than ever before. 
 Our Capital Markets business also allows us to monetize our content. It gives us an ability to syndicate excess equity and debt in our own transactions and in many cases, retain economics on what we syndicate. In 2011, our Capital Markets revenues were up 62%, and our fee-related earnings were up 66%, so we feel like we're seeing real traction here. 
 Samson is a great example of how our Capital Markets business is allowing us to punch above our weight. The equity requirement in the Samson transaction was over $4 billion. While we spoke for $1 billion, we decided that to execute our strategy with the company, we needed to control it. So instead of being a 25% holder alongside several other sponsors, we decided to bring the excess $3 billion of equity to others, so we ended up being able to speak for the entire $4 billion, control the company and make more money in the process. This business has grown from $34 million in revenues in 2009 to $170 million in 2011. 
 The fifth goal is earning the trust of our investors. Without this trust, we cannot build our firm. We're making great progress on this front as well. We've grown from about 275 investors 2 years ago to approximately 400 today or an increase of about 40%. Including where we are on NAXI, we've raised over $10 billion of capital since the start of 2011, almost double the $5.4 billion raised in 2010, and that $10 billion figure includes only a portion of the capital from TRS. 
 In addition to NAXI, we were able to close our Mezzanine Fund, add to our energy and infra funds, scale capital on our liquid credit businesses and launch our first equity hedge fund, all last year. We remain very busy on the capital raising front and recently launched fundraising for a new direct lending strategy, Asian private equity and special situations. We have made and continue to make a meaningful investment in distribution around the world. Here again, the expenses show up before the revenues, but with the goal of significant investor growth. We believe it is an important investment to make with a high return over time. 
 The sixth goal we've got is to create more scale in the newer businesses we've launched. If you step back and think about it, we really have one scale business at KKR, which is private equity. It's a wonderful business, where we have about a 4% market share in what is about a $1 trillion global market. Our other investing businesses: energy and infrastructure, real estate, high yield, leverage loans, mezzanine, distressed, hedge funds are all at relatively early stages in their evolution. 
 Two exciting things about this from our standpoint. First, the end markets in these businesses are materially larger in aggregate than private equity, roughly $6 trillion, so we have a lot of room to run. Also, the expense for these businesses is already burdening our P&L. So as we raise new capital, the flow-through from revenue to profits should be quite high. 
 So how are we doing overall? Well, we now have $12 billion in leverage loans and high-yield, $4 billion in energy and infrastructure and $3 billion in mezzanine and distressed. We're an aggregate of $19 billion in non-private equity assets, all built organically. Most of this was achieved in the last few years, and the momentum's growing. Our committed energy and infra capital grew over 100% last year, and our mezz and distressed capital grew 37%. 
 We continue to use our balance sheet to further accelerate our momentum in these businesses. Since our last call, we've committed $300 million to seed 2 new energy strategies and $100 million to launch our direct lending strategy. As we scale capital in these areas, we expect our AUM, fee-related earnings and our carry opportunity will benefit. 
 But we can't do any of these things without retaining our culture and attracting and retaining great people because we're passionate about getting this right. Our greatest accomplishment is that we've been able to grow our firm globally and into multiple asset classes, while keeping our one-firm culture intact. While we have a lot to do, we feel great about our progress in 2011, especially considering the very large investments we're making in new people, new businesses and distribution. 
 Our fee-related earnings were up 31% in the year and about 70% since 2009. Our PE portfolio beat the global market by 900 basis points last year and was up 36% over the last 2 years. Our investment performance in energy and infra and public markets remains very strong, and our distributable earnings were up 23% last year, and our distribution is up materially. 
 We think it's a great time for us. We're sourcing attractive new investments on a global basis and generating strong returns for our clients, which is allowing us to scale our businesses and grow our firm with a consistent culture. We remain resolutely focused on execution, and we're excited about the future. 
 Thanks for joining the call. We're happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Bill Katz with Citi. 
William Katz: Scott, I just wanted to -- maybe one of the themes you had highlighted, you've sort of laid out a few, but in terms of the number of LPs that have participated in the, I guess, the North American #11 fund, the NAXI fund I guess you're calling it, how many are sort of new, if you will, versus maybe your existing LPs? And how much maybe outside of the United States versus inside of the United States? 
Scott Nuttall: Bill, just give you some color. About 50%, roughly half, are from the U.S. and about half is from non-U.S., which is about what we would expect, with really broad-based support. And remember, this is just a first close so we've got another year of fundraising ahead of us. But to just give you some color, it was pension plans, sovereign wealth, insurance companies, some financial institutions and high net worth as well. We would expect in a first close a very high percentage to be re-ups from prior funds, and that's what we found here, that the majority and the vast majority kind of think about it is 3/4-plus of the first closers are existing relationships with us, and then we've got a very long list of prospects for the second and subsequent closes. 
William Katz: Yes, that's helpful. And second question is just in terms of the Texas account, it seems like there's a lot of that going on. I think a couple of your peers have had similar type of dynamics. So 2 questions. One is to help frame maybe the economics of the business. I guess, there's been some discussion of fee give-up but longer-lived capital. And the second part of the question is are there others behind this from a pipeline perspective that you can see? 
Scott Nuttall: Sure. I think the way to think about it is this is highly accretive type of relationship for us. I think what we're finding is a number of institutions, and we've talked about this on prior calls, are looking to consolidate the number of relationships they have and really go from kind of a siloed one-product relationship to a multiproduct relationship. So if Texas is going to give $3 billion to 10 groups, maybe we get our $300 million of that. But in this instance, they decided to give us $3 billion outright on a long-term basis with a recycling provision. So as we perform, the $3 billion of AUM will increase over time. The fee give-up is not a meaningful figure, frankly. This is a -- the way I would think about it, it's highly attractive and highly accretive for us. And over time, we think this is going to be a big win for us and for them. So think of it as multiproduct, long term, large scale and broad based across most of what we do as a firm without a meaningful give-up on the economics, some give-up but not meaningful. In terms of others, we'll see. I mean, this is hard to -- they're hard to get done. It took us a couple of years to get this strategic partnership with Texas completed. There are other dialogues going on out there, but it's hard to predict how many will actually get over the finish line. 
William Katz: Okay. One last one. I think if I got the numbers right in the capital [indiscernible] and private equity, it sounds like about 50% equity contribution, just sort of given the improvement in the markets and so forth and a little bit of an opening in the funding markets in the United States, in particular, has there been any kind of relaxation of that trend? Or is it -- maybe just a big picture of how you sort of see the allocation going forward to the equity and debt in incremental private equity deals. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, sure. I'd say that the market right now in the U.S. is a little bit different from Europe, Bill. So I'd say the U.S. is probably 30% to 40% equity in transactions. Europe's probably going to be 40-plus percent at this point. So I think last year, you had some numbers that maybe -- some deals that maybe skewed the number a little bit, including a deal like Samson which was a big transaction that had more than half equity in it. But I'd say, the overall markets are 30% to 40% equity contribution today. 
Operator: And next, we'll move to Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Carrier: Maybe first question, maybe just when we think about the mark-to-market and the returns just in the quarter, the color on the public portfolio as of today, it's helpful. If I think about the private side though, when I think about this quarter, when you look at what drives those valuations in terms of the assumptions, the discounted cash flows, as we continue to get some incremental better data out of the U.S. on the economic or the macro front, like, how should we expect that to change? Or were there many changes made in those assumptions this quarter but the likelihood that those could get incrementally more positive if this data continues? I'm just trying to figure out the value on the private side versus the public. 
Craig Larson: Sure, Michael. Scott, I'll take that one. The first thing I'd say, and I'll come around to trying to address your questions, I would not get too focused on the quarter. So keep in mind -- you got to remember in Q3, our portfolio was down 8.5%, but the market was down 14%. And for the year, we outperformed by 900 basis points, and for the last 2 years, we outperformed by 29 percentage points, so 2,900 basis points. So we're not as focused on the quarter-to-quarter, and we're really happy that we're outperforming the market so -- by such a large margin over the last couple of years and in 2011. Specific to Q4, what we found is that the publics did perform well. Our publics went up but a bit less than the market, just happened to be mix. And the privates, some of our private portfolio companies adjusted their longer-term projections down a little bit, which impacted their DCF valuation somewhat in the quarter. But keep in mind, that was done in a bit of a different environment in the fall, the world feels a little bit better today. So the way we look at it is, it is a moment in time, I think you've got the right interpretation. As management teams get more optimistic about the economic environment and the prospects, in the longer term, you would expect those DCF valuations to move up but there was not a material change in approach in the quarter. And I think what Bill said on the prepared remarks is really important. It is a moment-in-time calculation. Our publics are up 11% in the last 5 or so weeks, so that impacts our income statement meaningfully and would've basically doubled our ENI for the fourth quarter on that basis alone, created the better part of $300 million of incremental earnings just by that move, all else held equal. 
William Janetschek: Right. But again, it's just a moment in time, and so we control when we exit investments. And so even though the S&P was up, say, 12% in the fourth quarter and our publics were up 7%, 6 weeks later, our public portfolio is up 7.5% and the S&P is only up 7.5%. So it's really hard to just fixate on a particular mark at a particular quarter end. 
Michael Carrier: Yes, it's helpful, all the color. And then maybe on the exit side. You guys have probably been a bit more active than maybe the overall industry. But when you look at especially on the public side in terms of going through the market, is that environment getting better, just given the increase in the overall market levels, conversations out there? It seems like it's been more subdued, and there's been more strategic sales than outright, like IPOs. But just any color on that? 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, I'd break it into a few buckets. I think first is where we're seeing a lot of our realizations is around companies that we have that are already public. So I mentioned that, we've got about 30% of our portfolio is already in public stocks, so companies like HCA, like Dollar General, like Avago that have already gone public, and what we're doing is secondary offerings to sell down our position. And what we're finding is as our companies continue to perform, those stock prices are performing quite well. I mean, HCA is up 30% since the beginning of the year. We've got other companies like Rockwood up 40-plus percent since the beginning of the year. 
William Janetschek: And XP is up 40%. 
Scott Nuttall: So we're seeing good performance, and as the companies perform, there's an opportunity to monetize in the secondary market. And that's actually where you've seen a lot of our realizations happen. The second dynamic is strategic sales, and that has been relatively quiet the last few years. We are seeing that start to pick up. I mentioned 5 strategic sales last year, which was a big increase over the prior. We've been particularly active in our energy businesses in the strategic sale area. And I think that will continue to pick up as corporates are sitting on a lot of cash. And I think that one of the big beneficiaries of increasing confidence at the CEO level will be increased M&A activity. And so I think that will aid our strategic sales. In the IPO market, frankly, it's very company-dependent and it's kind of almost week-to-week. But since we've got so many companies that have already jumped through the IPO window, that's probably the least important consideration as we sit here today. 
Michael Carrier: Okay. And then just you mentioned on some of the new funds, I think there was a lending one, the Asia private equity and the special sits. Just any color or update on progress on some of those new products. 
Scott Nuttall: All 3 of those relatively early, so it'd probably be better to give you an update in next quarter and subsequent quarters. 
Operator: And we'll next move to Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital. 
Roger Freeman: I guess first just on the Texas Teachers, is there a rough timeline that you anticipate the rest of that capital flowing in, like over a 1- to 2-year period? 
Scott Nuttall: Roger, it's Scott. I would expect the capital will start to flow -- will flow in over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years. 
Roger Freeman: Okay. And then how does the recycling work? Is that over a specific period of time like if you have realizations early on then you can reinvest those? 
Scott Nuttall: Think of it as -- basically, the way it works is that we can recycle all of the capital, so the entire $3 billion, and then a portion of the profits that we generate on that capital. So we'll get to use the $3 billion over and over, and as we generate profits, we get to take a portion of those profits and recycle them back in. So the $3 billion of AUM, that will start to show up over the next few years, should grow over the subsequent several years. 
Roger Freeman: But I forgot to say, does that have a lifespan to it? Or is this just perpetual? 
Scott Nuttall: It is very long term. The lifespan has not been disclosed by them or us, but think of it as much longer than your normal fund relationship. 
William Janetschek: Think of it as long-term capital. 
Roger Freeman: Okay, great. And then I think you touched on this a bit, but you've seen a nice increase in number of clients, the 250 to 400. Maybe of this 400 now, how many of those are invested in 2 strategies? Or maybe how many are in 3 or more? I'm just trying to get a sense. You're both growing the client base as well as cross-selling. And I'm curious how you view that opportunity. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, we think that's a big opportunity, Roger. So on average, I think the number is about 1.6 products per client, and as we've added meaningfully to the number of products we have, we are just starting to make a real dent in that figure. And so I think the opportunity for us is exciting on both fronts, and we've talked a lot about adding to the number of clients but I think you're right, the cross-sell opportunity is pretty exciting as well, and we're really just starting to get traction on that in the last year or so. 
Craig Larson: The only thing I'd add on that, Roger, is if you think of the capital that we added in 2010 in particular, a lot of that was in first-time funds, it was energy, it was mezzanine, it was infrastructure and the like. So as we are now marketing some of the more traditional strategies like the North American private equity fund and second Asia fund, et cetera, that's certainly something that we're very focused on. 
Roger Freeman: Okay. Can you remind us how... 
William Janetschek: Keep in mind, we're in the early innings here because we just started launching these new strategies over the last 2 or 3 years. And so that's why it's so important that we've got the client and partner group to actually get out there and introduce these new products to a whole host of current and new investors. 
Roger Freeman: Yes, and that was actually my other question. How big is the sales team today versus when you had the 250 clients? And how much do you expect that to still grow? 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, roughly just -- rough just as we had, at the end of '08. You see, that is our starting point. We had about 4 people marketing product for KKR globally. We now have over 40 people in that group, probably 20 to 25 of those client-facing and the rest, more in the service and support side. So we've made a meaningful investment in that area, and we'd expect those numbers to continue to grow this year. 
Roger Freeman: Great, all right. Just lastly, what are your updated thoughts on opportunities for the firm in the new regulatory environment, when you think about factoring in Basel, Dodd-Frank with respect to the dealers, particularly I'm just thinking something like Volcker, which from -- given a market-making standpoint, you have a capital markets business on the balance sheet, like there to be some opportunities to buy liquidity on a short-term basis, rehabilitating some of the credit markets if they become uneconomical. 
Scott Nuttall: I'd say that the opportunities are pretty exciting for us coming out of all the regulatory change. As we'd discussed in the past, a lot of the traditional sources of capital to the markets are seriously impaired for all of the reasons you've talked through and all your reports and what we're seeing on the regulatory fronts impacting that as well. We think with Basel and Volcker, that's only going to increase. And so if you think about what that means for us, I'd say there's really 2 primary benefits. One is just investment opportunities. So you've seen us really try to scale our special situations business. That business is spending a lot of time today lending to providing capital to companies that don't have alternative sources. It's also spending a lot of time with banks, and today, particularly in Europe, that need to sell assets. And so the opportunity for that business is very exciting. We're also seeing that in our alternative credit strategies. So a lot of companies, especially middle market companies, are finding that their banks are not providing them with capital anymore. So what we're doing is we're stepping into the fray. Our Mezzanine business is doing that, we've launched this direct lending strategy we mentioned. That business is providing senior loans to companies that need capital. And so we're seeing opportunities in those parts of our business, and so we've really been scaling quite a bit. And part of the reason that opportunity is there, Roger, is that the traditional providers are either out of those markets permanently or temporarily, and so we're stepping into the void. The other thing that is providing the second opportunity for us is really talent. What we've found is that under Volcker and as these banks have been trying to figure out how to operate in this new regulatory regime, they've been letting people go, they've been getting out of businesses. The prime example of that for us is the Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies team that we brought over and started that hedge fund that Bill mentioned last year. So that team came over en masse and joined us. It's not clear to me if it hadn't been for the Volcker Rule that, that would've happened. So I'd say the opportunities for us are really one, investments; and two, people. 
Operator: And next, we'll move to Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill Investment. 
Michael Kim: First, I know you've got the European funds, the Asia fund, sounds like another one's on the way and kind of the China Growth Fund. But is the plan to continue to come to market with more specialized funds, either from a geographic standpoint or in terms of different strategies to kind of continue to broaden out the franchise and maybe improve the consistency of fundraising going forward? 
Scott Nuttall: Michael, it's Scott. Yes, I think that's right. I mean, we've got -- the way I would think about it is we have our traditional larger-scale funds. So in private equity, we've got North American fund, European fund and our Asian fund. And so obviously, we've talked a lot about NAXI, that's a continuation of -- more one of our more traditional funds. The Asian private equity vehicle that I mentioned is really our second vehicle for Asia, more in the traditional fund category. But then, we are going to launch adjacent strategies like China Growth, which raised $1 billion in a very short period of time that we've talked about. So I think you're thinking about it right. We'll have a group of traditional funds that we'll continue to scale, and then we'll build adjacent strategies alongside in Private Markets. But that's just kind of in the private equity space. If you think about what else we've been doing, we've been launching vehicles in energy and infra. We've been launching vehicles in alternative credit. At some point, we'll figure out what we're going to do in terms of launching a real estate vehicle. So I think you're right, we're going to have just a constant stream of ongoing traditional funds. We're going to have a kind of the newer funds that we'll be launching and raising that will, then, have their successors. And then we have a group of businesses where the fundraising is continuous, think high-yield, loans, our hedge fund business. So it's really going to be the case that I think we're going to have several products in the market at any given time. 
Michael Kim: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow on realizations. Any color in terms of how we should be thinking about maybe the trajectory of realized cash carry this year and into '13, just given some of your comments around your public company holdings, as well as the pickup in strategic sales? 
William Janetschek: Well, let me take that one. If you look at our portfolio today, as Scott mentioned, about 30% of our assets are in public securities, and we've done a primary and we've done secondaries. And to the extent that there's an opportunity to exit those positions, we will react accordingly. Just to give you some color, in 2010, we actually distributed about $4 billion to our LPs. That number was up in 2011 to over $6 billion. So we actually have the assets that are quite liquid. As it relates to what the impact is on carry and more importantly to your point, cash carry, all of our funds but Europe II accrue carry. And of the 7 funds that we have, 4 of them are in cash carry mode. So if we sold an investment in the European, Millennium, Asia or China Growth Fund, to the extent that there would be a realization, it would be cash carry to pay. '06, as we mentioned on several calls, is well above cost. But right now, there are a couple of investments in that portfolio that are below cost, so that even if we sold an investment, we actually wouldn't receive cash carry. But again, if you took the portfolio as a whole right now and sold it in its entirety, you would receive cash carry. E3 right now is more or less breakeven. It's, as of December 31, just a little bit above cost. And then, as I mentioned, D2 is the only fund below cost. So that'll give you some color that, as we exit investments, where you'll see the opportunities to see cash carry. 
Scott Nuttall: I think the way to think about it, Michael, as you can see in the back of the press release, we've seen a meaningful increase in realized cash carry year-over-year, Q4-over-Q4, and so as we continue to make progress in creating value in the funds and see future realizations, that should translate into incremental cash carry over time. It's very hard to predict exactly when and how that's going to show up, however. So a lot of that is going to be dependent on the markets, and then whether we have any of these larger strategic sales happen, then you could have some nice surprises. But it's very hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. 
William Janetschek: And just to drive on the point again on cash carry, from 2010 to 2011, cash carry distributed in 2010 was 19, and in 2011, it was 26. So that's up over 30%. 
Michael Kim: Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally just to come back to the real estate business. I know it's still early days but maybe if you could talk about some of the opportunities that you might be in a position to capitalize on today and then how you see that franchise developing over time. 
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Look, I think what we're trying to do, Michael, is broaden our dialogue, back to your first question. We're now talking to CIOs and just institutional investors and high net worth investors about a variety of different ways that they can deploy capital and a lot of different ways we can help. And really, what we've been trying to do is target our efforts in areas where we see the most severe dislocations and the most severe imbalance from a supply-demand standpoint. And one of the reasons that we've started our real estate business is it looks like there's a significant supply-demand imbalance from a capital standpoint in the real estate markets that's going to persist for a long time. And a lot of the clients that we're trying to help are figuring out how to participate in that dislocation and benefit from moving their capital to it. So what we've done is we've brought on a team, which has been with us better part of the year now and have been looking at a variety of different transactions. The statistic that I think is interesting is there's about $1 trillion of CMBS coming due between now and the end of 2014. We think probably half of that does not have a home. And so what that means is there's a variety of different very interesting opportunities, U.S., Europe and Asia. And what we're finding is that there are still lenders to the very senior part of capital structures for real estate. The life insurance companies in particular are prepared to lend to the senior 50% of a capital structure. But there are very few providers of capital to the bottom 50%. And so the securitization markets have not recovered, and so what that means is that there's a significant capital need at that bottom half of the capital stack. And so where we're spending our time is both equity, so think about it as opportunistic equity. And we're also spending time in kind of more the mezzanine part of the capital stack, think of the 30% to 50% tranche where we're finding very attractive returns. And what the team's finding is the opportunities are very broad-based. We've never had a team come into the firm and get as busy as quickly as this team has. And there's just a variety of opportunities on a global basis, commercial, multifamily, U.S., Europe, Asia. There's a variety of opportunities around the world. So the way we're attacking it is a couple-fold. One, we've got the real estate team integrated with and working with other investment teams in the firm, so a lot of the work is going to kind of meld between real estate and distressed. And so our special situations team and our real estate team are working together on some projects and trying to get those done. And we've also dedicated $300 million of capital off our own balance sheet. And the team is working with that $300 million of capital and is working on a variety of different transactions. And we will use our Capital Markets business to syndicate any excess that we want to keep. And so the idea is build our track record, do some deals with the firm's capital and through the syndication mechanism and then, over time, we'll launch a fund. But what we don't want to do is miss any of the current opportunities, which, we think, are pretty exciting. 
Operator: And we'll move on to Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
M. Patrick Davitt: It's actually Patrick. I had to run because the mortgage settlement came out. So on the realized cash carry in the fourth quarter, we had tried to account for some of the shale sales that you had, still came in a lot better than we expected. Could you kind of run through all of the components of that realized cash number that was distributed? 
William Janetschek: Patrick, this is Bill. Sure. We had already given you information last quarter, that approximately $0.06 was going to come through in the fourth quarter from the 2 shale plays. But during the quarter, we also had a secondary sale of Legrand, and we also had a secondary of Dollar General, and that accounted for the additional $0.03 of cash carry during the quarter. 
M. Patrick Davitt: I thought Dollar General was in the 2006 fund. Is it not? 
William Janetschek: It is, and it's a small amount. And thanks for pointing that out. When we did Dollar General, not only did we make the investment through the fund but we also had co-invest vehicles, which we were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to receive some carry on. And so when that transaction closed in the '06 Fund, our LPs received all of the capital, and that went towards filling the netting hole in '06. But with co-invest vehicles, we actually are entitled to receive cash carry. That amount -- not to get too excited, the amount, $0.01 a share. 
M. Patrick Davitt: Okay. I thought that you would recycle co-invest back into co-invest? Or is that not the same as the principal portfolio when you say co-invest? 
Scott Nuttall: No. Think of that as -- syndicated co-invest, that's a third-party. 
M. Patrick Davitt: Okay, all right. Okay, cool. So the new Capital and Private markets, I assume that roughly $1 billion of that was Texas Teachers because there was $1.4 billion for the quarter, I think. Am I looking at the year? 
William Janetschek: No, you're looking at the quarter. What ended up happening in that $1.4 billion is roughly about $700 million was from infrastructure and energy-related SMAs. And the other amount was from co-investments that we made where we were entitled to receive some carry. 
Scott Nuttall: So to answer your question directly, there was not $1 billion from TRS in the quarter. It was other capital raising. 
William Janetschek: Right, yes. As a matter of fact, there was no Texas. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, there was no Texas in Q4. There was some Texas in prior quarters, but nothing in Q4. 
William Janetschek: Right, the prior quarter number, just for clarity, was $1 billion. 
M. Patrick Davitt: But as the new money comes in from TRS, it will show up in that line item? 
Scott Nuttall: Correct. 
William Janetschek: As they commit new strategy and we close that particular fund, it'll show up in AUM and the fee-paying AUM, yes. 
M. Patrick Davitt: Okay, all right. Finally, it looks like Capmark Financial disappeared from your principal activities kind of run down. Could you explain that? 
William Janetschek: Sure. We've been carrying that at 0 for the better part of a couple of years. We carried it on our balance sheet only for the fact that we still own the asset. Capmark emerged from bankruptcy and the equity that we held got canceled and so we took it off our balance sheet. No impact to the earnings. 
Operator: And Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley will have our next question. 
Matthew Kelley: Hoping to drill down a little bit more on your LP base. If you talk about pension, sovereign wealth and high net worth, among others, what are those -- what strategies are those investors by type looking for the most? I appreciate your color on real estate, so wondering where you're getting the most traction there, where in Europe, et cetera. 
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Matt, it's Scott. I think frankly it's fairly broad-based. What we're doing is we're talking to investors about what they're trying to achieve. And everybody we're talking to is just trying to figure out how to get return overall as the first priority. They've been looking at their historical results and long on the equities and high-grade fixed income for the last decade, and they've generated low-single digits at best. And so that theme is very consistent. Another theme we're hearing is that they are prepared to take some illiquidity in order to increase their returns. I think we're kind of out of the bunker fully now, and people understand that you're not to going to be able to get 10-plus percent returns without giving up some liquidity. And so that's been a great help as we've been launching new strategies and engaging in this dialogue. Pension funds, in particular, I'd say, are looking for a number of things. They want to figure out how to beat their 8% growth in their liabilities, and so they're rotating into a variety of longer-term alternatives, private equity amongst them, but there's also an interest on the part of pension funds increasingly in yielding strategies, the thought being if they can actually generate a yield of 8-plus percent, then they've got their growth in their liabilities covered. And they knew  anything above that is kind of upside from there, so we're definitely hearing that theme from pension funds. We're also hearing that theme from high net worth, that there's absolutely an interest in that. So as you think about what we've been launching as a firm, all of our products, except for private equity and our hedge fund, have some kind of yield associated with it. And so we're finding that those products are playing particularly well with those audiences. It's absolutely the case. Insurance companies, I would say it's a bit of a different flavor. Insurance companies, because they are more focused on GAAP bottom line or probably even more focused, as a priority matter, on yield, and so we're finding a lot of interest there more in the high yield area, mezzanine, distressed, anything that's going to have a current yield is attractive. But the interest is broad-based, and it's on a global basis. As we look at where the capital has been coming from recently, it's where you're seeing capital formation happen, a lot of interest out of Asia, a lot of interest out of the Middle East. We're increasingly noticing more activity in the U.S. and in Europe. So I'd say it's global and the themes are: they like return, they like yield, they like energy, they like Asia. And if -- we've got a lot of products that kind of fit within what they're trying to achieve. 
Matthew Kelley: Okay, that's really helpful. So as we're talking about returns and some of your investors more willing to tie up money for longer periods of time, what -- have return bogeys come down for them? Are their expectations reset lower? 
Scott Nuttall: I think most of our investors, Matt, look at it, our returns, relative to public indices. So I think what has happened is that their expectations for returns out of the public markets have come down, and they're looking for a certain number of basis points that have outperformance relative to those public markets. And so that's why we tend to talk about it on that basis. I think they're looking at it on that basis. So part of it is based on the individual investor you're talking to and what they think they can get out of the public markets. And the way they look at it is: How much excess return do I need to basically forgo the liquidity and give capital to you, KKR? And so that tends to be the basis on which the conversations happen and how they measure our performance. And I think as a general matter, expectations in terms of the overall markets have come down a bit. But having said that, everybody would still, especially in PE, like to get a 15%, 20-plus percent return. So it kind of depends on who you're speaking with, but the way most of them are compensated and we're benchmarked is relative to the public markets. 
Matthew Kelley: Okay, very helpful. Just one follow-up from me. Any interest from your side on launching or getting into actively managed ETFs to distribute more to high net worth? 
Scott Nuttall: Not on the near-term game plan. 
Operator: And next, we'll move to Robert Lee with KBW Securities. 
Robert Lee: Actually, Bill, just can we go way back to your comments about when the NAXI fund starts coming into the financials? I'm not sure I understood it correctly. Is that Q4 '12 that you'll expect that to start rolling in, and that's when 6, I guess, flips to its -- flips over? 
William Janetschek: Correct. We expect that to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the subtlety here is remember, in the '06 Fund, we still have $1.8 billion. The capital that we're investing for those investors, our assumption is that those funds will be invested in the first half of the year. And the reason why I was specific about the fourth quarter is that just we have a contractual arrangement with our '06 investors that we won't actually start charging a fee on the NAXI fund but for the one-year anniversary of the last fee charged for the '06 Fund. And so the '06 Fund runs from September '11 through September '12, and that would be its last investment period. And so then even if we started to deploy capital in the third quarter of 2012 for NAXI, the fee actually wouldn't turn on until the fourth quarter of 2012. At which point, the '06 Fund, as I mentioned, would start paying its post-investment period fee of 75 basis points. 
Robert Lee: Right. And on the '06 Fund, when that fund flips, do you kind of hold back some capital that stops earning fees? Or is it kind of all in? 
William Janetschek: Well, right now, we do have a reserve set up for that '06 Fund, and if by chance and it would have to be based upon a fact pattern, if we ended up reserving a certain amount of capital and then started investing in NAXI, and then we use those funds for a particular investment in the '06 Fund. Once it got invested, we'd start receiving a post-investment period fee on that capital. 
Robert Lee: Right. But until that point, you wouldn't earn the fee on that reserve? 
William Janetschek: That is correct. 
Robert Lee: Right, okay. And... 
Scott Nuttall: And Rob the only thing I -- 2 points to add on that is that there's no obligation to invest the reserve and thinking about that it's not allocated to -- it's a pool of money, so it's not as though there is something that those dollars are pre-allocated towards. 
Robert Lee: Okay, great. And then trying to think about what it would take to move, say, '06 and maybe some of the other funds to a cash carry position. I mean, understanding if you liquidated the whole thing, you'd generate cash carry. But is there any way to that of quantify that? And I know it's maybe somewhat of a moving target, but you need, I don't know, $400 million of cash realizations in order to get Fund '06 to a cash carry position. I mean, how should we kind of think what it would take to kind of get that to cash carry? 
William Janetschek: So you are right, it is a moving target. Obviously, each quarter, we value our portfolio companies and on some of these private portfolios, if the investment is marked below cost, we don't have the ability to pay out cash carry. And we have to look at this quarter-to-quarter because if we are carrying an investment below cost, and then if the company starts to perform, if we write down investment up in a successive quarter, that netting hole actually shrinks. So it's really hard to give you any sort of guidance as when to expect cash carry other than I will tell you that as we get close, we'll make sure that everyone knows that we are getting close. 
Operator: And we'll move on to Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. 
Marc Irizarry: Marc Irizarry, Goldman. Scott, just on TRS again. Can you walk through how willing you are to allocate -- like how big TRS could potentially be as a component of new strategies that you're seeding? And how you're sort of going through -- where you're going to allocate their $3 billion? 
Scott Nuttall: Sure. Mark, I think generally speaking, the way to think about it is in 3 buckets: there's going to be a private equity component; there's going to be an energy, infra, real assets component; and then there's going to be an alternative credit strategies and just opportunistic component. And roughly, we'll see, over time, how that develops in conversations between us, but if you want to think about that as approximately 1/3 each, that you'd be about right in terms of the thinking today. So we would expect that, that will change over time. I think one of the things that we and they saw as part of this is an ability to work together to launch newer businesses for the firm. And so I expect it could be a source of capital for some of the new things that we do together. It's clearly not going to be a majority of the capital, but it will be an attractive source of capital, and that'll be something that we develop in conversation with them. Just parenthetically, our oil and gas business, our KKR Natural Resources business was a business that we started with Texas Teachers. So it actually initially came out of a meeting where we were talking about a theme in the energy space, and we and they decided to start that business together. And so they're actually a meaningful source of capital for that business, and we've talked together about real estate as an example and other areas that could follow on for that. But one of the other things that we saw, the benefit here, both they and us, is an ability to move quickly into market dislocations. And so there is a portion of the capital that's not even allocated to specific strategies. It's just when we together see interesting market opportunities, we can rotate the capital there quickly because the traditional diligence effort of months and months of back-and-forth, sometimes the opportunity can go away. So we have an ability together to move very quickly to fill voids and take advantage of market opportunities with the capital as well. 
Marc Irizarry: Okay. And then just a quick follow-on on that. Do you think as you bring on more of these deals or more of these LP relationships, does this at all alter the general partner co-invest when you're thinking about new strategies? 
Scott Nuttall: No, I wouldn't think of it as changing that dynamic. 
Marc Irizarry: Okay, great. And then just one more time on the '06 Fund. I mean, I don't know, Bill, if you can give us any color on -- are their individual investments that are above costs today that you could monetize, that would put you in cash carry mode in '06? 
William Janetschek: Yes. Okay, again, I mentioned earlier that if you took the entire '06 Fund and sold it at today's cost, we would receive cash carry. So we have several positions in the '06 Fund that are well above costs, take for example, ATA or Dollar General. And so if there was a significant monetization in either one of those, that would certainly go well to filling the hole and getting us a lot closer to paying out cash carry. 
Operator: And Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer will have our next question. 
Christoph Kotowski: Most of my questions have been asked. Then you may not be able to answer with this one but is there a way to think about, historically, in the funds that you've raised, is there a typical spread between the first close and the final close? 
Scott Nuttall: Chris, it's Scott. There's not a typical spread. It's really been all over the map. And frankly, given that this is really the first traditional fund we've raised since the credit crisis, I'd be loathe to give you any prediction or anything that you could work from. So no data to help on that front, unfortunately. 
William Janetschek: And we've certainly thought about it. 
Operator: And our final question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital. 
Roger Freeman: Just had 2 follow-ups. One, just on the earlier discussion around LPs. I'm just wondering, in your discussions with pension funds, you'd sense that there's a lot of -- they're getting a lot of pressure on there end  to lower their return assumptions. And is there a -- are we at a catalyst point here? Is that part of why the discussion is picking up or are you going to have to bite that bullet or show near-terms that are better return profiles? 
Scott Nuttall: I think that could be driving part of it, Roger. But I think it's just a bigger practical issue. The practical issue is they've had 1% or 2% returns over the last decade and their liabilities are growing 8%. They're underfunded now. And if they project that out using 1% or 2% or 5% or 6%, they're going to be even more underfunded. And so I think part of it is what's the right return assumption for the long term, but I think there's just a bigger practical issue of where are they going to go to find return and the subpoint, kind of where do they get return that's not completely correlated with everything else they have. And so I think it's part of it, but the bigger driving consideration, frankly, is they know that if 90% of their portfolio is generating low-single digits, it's very hard to get anything into the 8-plus on the overall portfolio unless you change allocations and you're more aggressive in terms of what you do with your capital. 
Roger Freeman: Yes. Change your allocations pretty aggressively too. 
Scott Nuttall: Right. 
Roger Freeman: Okay. And then other thing and I may have missed this. Have you said on the equity launch strategy -- I know you just launched it, but where does that stand right now in terms of the AUM and how much of that is your capital? And I think you have said you've started raising third-party money back in the fall. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, we've started -- we're managing about $400 million or so today. 
Roger Freeman: Okay. Is most of that still is yours? 
Scott Nuttall: No. Most of that is third-party at this point. 
Roger Freeman: Oh, it is. Okay. 
Scott Nuttall: Yes, we just -- we've been out raising capital and picking up speed on that front. 
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional. 
Craig Larson: Everybody, we really appreciate your time this afternoon. We look forward to talking with you next quarter. 
Operator: And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC third quarter 2011 earnings conference. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Angela Yang. Please go ahead. 
Angela Yang: Thank you operator, and afternoon, everyone. I'm Angela Yang, part of Investor Relations for KKR Financial Holdings LLC. And joining me on the call today are Bill Sonneborn, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating and Financial Officer. This afternoon's call is being webcast on our website at www.kkr.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call available as well. Our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011 were issued today. And as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we get started, I would like to caution you that this conference call and webcast contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of operations of the company as well as general economic conditions.  These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. KFN's actual results may vary materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In addition, some of the discussion today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures as well as their corresponding GAAP reconciliations may be found in the supplemental information packet available on our website. The supplemental information packet on our website includes information that we will be referring to on our call today. And we encourage you to have this information available during the call. With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Sonneborn.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Angela. And thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I’ll begin my remarks with some highlights for the quarter, followed by an update in the market and how KFN has posed to perform in this current environment. For purposes of this call, we will suggest you refer to the supplemental information packet, Angela described, which is available on your website as we’ll be pointing out several pages of that presentation in these remarks.  First today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an $0.18 cash distribution on our common shares. This distribution is payable on December 1 to shareholders of record on November 17. Despite continued strong cash generation in the quarter, we elected not this quarter to increase the distribution, to take advantage of some significant opportunities that emerged beginning in August and into September, as a result of the impact of the U.S. Debt fueling debate and the fall on [inaudible] European macro uncertainty. Before we go into specifics on our earnings and other key financial statistics, it is sometimes useful to look at where we stand today, relative to just three years ago, and how we have adapted and learned as a company. In October 2008, three years ago today, we were on our back foot with little available equity to take advantage of strong negative market technicals. Today, we’re on our front foot. While market movements we have recently experienced compacted mark-to-market value of our assets as of the end of the third quarter, they have presented a substantial opportunity to invest in assets we know and like, that we believe have the potential to drive much higher cash earnings in distributions in the future. Now for our quarterly results, which Mike will take you through in greater detail later on in this call. Net income for the quarter totaled 39.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This compares to $0.59 in earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011, and $0.52 for the third quarter of 2010. This quarter’s net income was down from these prior periods due really primarily, to almost exclusively to unrealized losses driven by declines in asset prices, as well as losses due to changes in foreign currency rates net of hedging. However, our core earnings increased year-over-year with net investment income up 10.6% to 86.6 million for the third quarter of 2011, from 78.3 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Additionally, net investment income less non-investment expenses increased 22.4% year-over-year to 68.7 million for the third quarter of 2011 from 56.2 million for the third quarter of 2010. We are pleased to continue to see such substantial growth in our top line. On a cash basis, run-rate cash earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.28 per share, and total net cash earnings per share equaled $0.29 per share. Comparatively, run-rate cash earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011, just last quarter, totaled $0.36 and total net cash earnings per share were $0.35 per share. Total and run-rate cash earnings per share represent a 12% cash return on equity for this quarter. The quarter-over-quarter variance is primarily due to the semi-annual interest paid on our convertible notes during the third quarter, which totaled approximately $13 million or $0.07 per share. Run-rate cash earnings per share and total net cash earnings per share are two key non-GAAP metrics that we focus on as they represent cash that we can either distribute to our shareholders or retain for future growth. Really free cash flow generated to our common shareholders. [inaudible] and third quarter results reflected a decline, as I mentioned, in asset prices that led to unrealized mark-to-market losses during the quarter, and didn’t have an impact on either our cash flow generation or the underlining performance of the company. Counter intuitively, KFN ended the quarter in a better position than when the quarter started from the perspective of potential future earnings and free cash flow generation.  Our CLOs remain quite strong. Despite a 6% decline in bank loan and high-yield prices on average during the quarter, we’re able to maintain or improve the over-collateralization ratios of CLOs, which demonstrates that our cash flow production is not dependent on swings and credit prices, or spreads. We did so while deploying 625 million of capital to purchase new assets during the quarter, particularly towards the end of the quarter, including discounted loans and bonds within our CLO structures at spreads that we have not seen since 2009. I would ask you to turn to Page 27 of our supplemental presentation, which shows the comparison of the over collateralization levels for our five traditional cash flow CLOs over time graphically, in addition to the period of September of 2008. On the previous Page 26, we highlight our newest CLO, CLO 2011-1, which during September we finished ramping at substantially higher yields than we originally modeled when we did the structure. Next, our special situation strategy. This strategy focuses on stressed and distressed opportunities including substantial asset price dislocations. With the market turmoil and resulting flight to treasury by risk of versed investors, we have seen an increasing shift in opportunities. Our special situation strategy enables us to benefit wider spread environment, focusing on equity-like rate to return funded off our balance sheet, and we focus on opportunities both in the U.S. and abroad. During the past quarter, this strategy deployed or committed to deploy nearly 50 million of capital to new opportunities; the majority of which were to European assets. We continue to see this opportunity to grow post-quarter end, and in the month of October we committed over 20 million opportunities in this strategy. Next, on to mezzanine. In the past quarters we discussed that our focus on mezzanine was predominately in Europe and Australia, as we didn’t see attractive risk compensation from U.S. opportunities due to the strength of the high yield market, and tightening credit spreads, and a playing field crowded with domestic mezzanine-focused investors such as BDCs.  The backdrop has quickly changed with the virtual shutdown of the U.S. high-yield market, and we’re announcing the best and largest pipeline for U.S. mezzanine opportunities since the European debt crisis began over a year ago. I also want to provide you an update on our national resources strategy. As production increased in our working and royalty interest in oil and gas properties, we experienced a substantial increase in both earnings contribution and free cash flow from this strategy during the quarter. With respect to earnings, these investments including commodity hedges for our working interest, generated 7.5 million of income for the third quarter of 2011, as compared to a loss of $100,000 for the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the benefit of our commodity hedges totally 3.5 million for the third quarter and 400,000 for the second quarter, profit contribution from this strategy was 4 million for the third quarter against a loss of 500,000 just one quarter ago. On an annualized basis, our third quarter natural resources working in royalty interest generated a return on capital, an ROE, of 28% including hedges and 15% excluding the impact and benefit of those hedges. With respect to cash flow, run-rate cash earnings per share included nearly $6 million or $0.03 per share, from this strategy during the third quarter as compared to only 1.1 million or less than $0.01 per share for the second quarter. In addition to our direct production interest, this week we closed on the sale of our 10 million investment in Hilcorp Resources Holdings LP, made just over a year ago for 2.7 times our purchase price, as well as the sale of the small Eagleford Shale private equity investment we made a year ago for approximately two times our purchase price. We entered the fourth quarter with a robust pipeline of natural resource investments covering both proven developed, convention oil and gas, and proven undeveloped shale play resource opportunities. With respect to the right hand side of our balance sheet, price declines have had no negative impact on our financing, as we don’t have any mark-to-market debt as we’ve mentioned in previous calls. We don’t finance assets to repos or swaps, and we’re really insulation from market price volatility as a result. As discussed last quarter, we are focused on continued growth in our business, while maintaining high returns on invested capital. To that end, we’re happy to announce that we are now investment grade rated for the first time in our history. As announced in the press release – the press release issued today, we received a triple B rating from Fitch Ratings, triple B- from Standard & Poor’s. We thought to have KFN rated by both agencies to provide us with additional flexibility for capital while lowering the overall cost of our capital. Next, an update on the markets. While we only saw symptoms beginning in the second quarter, the third quarter was hit with pretty close to a full fledge blue. The S&P 500 fell over 15% and had 34 out of 64 trading days with inter price moves of over 2%.  While credit markets initially lagged equities, they caught up within a matter of days. The Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II index, as an example, retreated 6.3%, and the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index cost nearly 4%.  By the end of the quarter, leverage credit spreads had basically returned to beginning-of-year levels as high yield spreads widened 185 basis points to 835 basis points, for an absolute yield of 9.5%, and leveraged loan spreads widened by 224 basis points to 776 basis points. Like the equity markets, the credit markets were extremely volatile with typical daily swings of 1 to 2% in prices. Even accounting for the macro risk present in the current environment, we’re seeing very good risk return opportunities in the credit market, and it’s substantially increased our investment pace as a result.  This year’s being driven by both fundamental and technical factors. Fundamentally, we see a low probability that global economy is heading for the type of downturn that would justify credit spreads on senior secured first lien loans approaching 800 basis points, and a high yield market trading 850 basis points wide of treasury. A disciplined focus on strong credit stories in defensive sectors should serve us well. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike, to go through our financial results in more detail.
Michael McFerran:  Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon everyone. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.22 which translates to a 9% return on GAAP equity, with a quarter investment income total of 134.4 million, which represent a 10% year-over-year increase, and that investment income totaled 86.6 million which represents a 11% year-over-year increase. Total investment income for the quarter includes 7.4 million of discount accretion from prepayments, as compared to 4.4 million for the corresponding prior year period. Other investment income for the quarter totaled 10.1 million and consist primarily of 10 million of income from both our working interest, overwriting royalty interest, and oil and gas property. The income generated by these natural resources holdings was offset by 5.9 million of related expenses during the quarter. As we continue to grow our natural resources holdings, we expect net revenue to steadily increase, as production increases through drilling of undeveloped properties. This quarter’s total other loss totaled 29.3 million compared to total other income of 62.6 million the second quarter, and 26.6 million from a year ago.  The $29.3 million loss consists of realized gains that are offset by unrealized losses. Specifically, we had 34.1 million of realized gains primarily from sales of certain bond holdings during the month of July before we experienced the credit price backup that we saw in August and September. More than offsetting the realized gains were unrealized losses. The large component being 43.8 million or $0.24 per diluted common share, lower cost per market adjustment related to $500 million of corporate loans held for sale. This was directly attributable to the decline of loans that we priced that we witnessed during the quarter. While market conditions for corporate loans remain volatile during the month of October, we have witness a noticeable increase in asset prices. As of the end of October, we believe the weighted average estimated fair value of our corporate debt portfolio was 92% of PAR value, that’s compared to 89% of PAR as of September 30. During the quarter we had net unrealized losses from our private equity holdings, carried estimated fair value totalling 13.5 million. Primary in equity positioned we received through previously held debt instruction and had net unrealized losses from foreign exchange translation totaling 7.5 million. Our book value per-share as of quarter end was $9.14. The decline in book value is primarily attributable to $0.81 per share decline in other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. The $0.81 decline consist of $0.58 per share decline as securities classify as available for sale, and a $0.23 decline in our interest rate swap, classified as cash flow hedges. As of the end of October, we have seen an estimated $0.35 per share recovery in the value of these combined holdings. The fair value of our corporate debt portfolio was 89%` of PAR value at the quarter end, compared with carrying value for GAAP purposes of 91% of PAR. Next, cash flows. Our cash flows for the quarter continues to remain strong with run-rate cash earnings of $0.28 per share with total net cash earnings of $0.29 per share. Run-rate cash earnings per share of $0.28 equates to 12% cash return on equity and is $0.08 lower than a $0.36 run-rate cash earnings per share for the second quarter. The primary contributor to the change in run rate cash earnings was the semi-annual interest payments remain in our convertible note during the third quarter, which happens semi-annually. This accounted for about $0.07 of that differential. Next the liquidity. We ended the quarter with 137.3 million of unrestricted cash, and we continue to have no borrowings outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facilities. During the quarter, we repurchased 45.1 million of our 7% convertible notes maturing in July 2012, resulting in a remaining balance of 135.4 million as of September 30. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, we are currently focused on debt capital as a means to fund growth in the near term given our desire to continue to enhance earnings to cash flow per share, and lower our cost of capital. We recognize that withholding company leverage net of cash of 0.28 times has very low leverage, and we do have flexibility to add leverage to our balance sheet. As Bill mentioned, we have received investment-grade ratings from both Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, which we view as a key milestone in providing more options for us to issue [inaudible] debt transactions. All leverage is not created equal, and we are sensitive to leverage that contains mark-to-market of refinancing risk, as we’ve talked about many times in the past. As such, we have worked to obtain the ratings to provide us with the flexibilities to issue secured or unsecured bonds without having short-term refinancing or mark-to-market risk. We continue to see a value of debt financing options, especially in light of the July 2012 maturity of our convertible notes. Now I’m going to hand this back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn:  Thanks, Mike, and I know a number of you will have questions, but before opening it up to your specific Q&A, I wanted to provide some closing remarks regarding KFN in today’s volital environment.  Although investors anxiously wait to see this chapter close, we will likely continue to operate in volatile economic environment as we watch the tenants of across the Atlantic and U.S. debt saga and debt problems play out. Despite the bipolar nature of the market environment, we are working on a pipeline of new opportunities that we believe will be accretive to shareholder value. We are firm believers in investing behind large and sustained supply and demand and imbalances. And everything we do is done following thorough analysis of such trends.  Volatility is our friend by creating very interesting buying opportunities for our long-dated capital, especially an example in our special situation strategy. And we will continue to present an advantageous prospects for our strong teams. Lastly, we anticipate growing our natural resources and capital start commercial real estate assets, given today’s healthy pipeline of opportunities.  These are the types of markets where one can drive differentiated outcomes. While we’ve under gone a significant transformation from the 2008 time period I referenced, there’s one thing that hasn’t changed, our investment in risk discipline, it only gets better.  Our capital deployment decisions are based on convictions found through comprehensive efforts. And with focus on developing the competitive advantage that KKR brings to such ideas. With that, I’ll open this up for questions. Operator.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). And we’ll take our first question from John Hecht with JMP Securities. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is related to GAAP financials versus small provision in the quarter. Is there any detail behind that? 
Michael McFerran:  That’s – John, that was done just to increase by a small amount on 2.5 million or unallocated reserve to keep our reserve level at approximately 3% of amortized cost per loan. There’s no other drivers behind that. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: The 3% of the average of cost of the right number to look at? 
Michael McFerran:  That’s pretty much the range we’ve kept for the last several quarters considering the current credit environments, which we think, frankly, are pretty prudent reserved levels and anticipate the volital market that we’re in. But there were no under events in the portfolio that drove us to want to increase the provision. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Exactly. It didn’t come from the bottom up credit review, it was much more of a top-down adjustment relative to aggregate unallocated reserve relative to the size our loan portfolio, Jonn. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. And on that, it’s a good topic. What are you guys seeing in your portfolio with respect to fundamental trends at this point? 
Bill Sonneborn:  You know, it’s interesting, we’ve – as a firm that just recently surveyed a bunch of the CEOs of our private equity portfolio in the context of what’s going on from a macroeconomic perspective in the U.S, Europe and Asia, and in summary, there has been not just what you’re seeing in terms of market volitility but a pronounced slowdown in a number of markets. A particular concern is Europe, not just in the context of what’s going on with Greece and the potential periphery sovereign debt issues, but also in terms of the microeconomic climate that businesses are operating in.  We’ve seen a pretty steady downturn recently in the context of European demand, both not only at the consumer level, but also what had been recently strong, which is with the business-to-business level.  On top of that, the emerging markets, which had been kind of the savior for a lot of companies that are selling to consumers or to other businesses as a means of topline growth, has waned particularly because of China’s access to credit. The one bastion of reasonable stability that we’re seeing is actually the U.S. market, which is at least being stable in the context of all the moving pieces.  So you know, based upon all the [inaudible] data we’re seeing through portfolio company positions and other situations, we see a deceleration of any terms of growth, but we are seeing more stability in the U.S. relative to other markets. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay, that’s great. Nice color. Thanks. With respect to your investment-grade rating, how, and I think, Mike, you pointed out as it points to a debt-to-equity holding company, what kind of leverage would you strive for or would you be comfortable with the holding company? 
Michael McFerran:  You know, to start with, John, obviously, and I know you’ve heard this from us many times. It really goes back to what type of leverage. So we’re very focused on the tenor of the debt. For a business like this, you know, again, we recognize we have very low leverage on the balance sheet, which gives us a lot of flexibility. But at the same time, we’re focused on wanting to have debt. I think we will, over the next year or two, we got to a level of 0.5, we see that pretty reasonable. But I think getting to under 0.1 or less than one turn of leverage, the holding company level, would still be pretty conservatively level for the business. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. Thank you. My last question, you’d mentioned you didn’t increase the dividend despite having pretty strong cash flows in the quarter because the investment opportunities had strengthened. In a balanced market where, you know, investment opportunities are neither strengthening or weakening, what would be a good payout ratio that you guys would be, you know, striving for or looking to get to over time? 
Bill Sonneborn:  That’s a good question, John. And we talked a little bit about this in the last quarter when we talked about the ability to do a special distribution at the end of each year as well. But I think our philosophy has been consistent now for the past three years, which is, in periods when we’re finding fewer opportunities that you continue to increase that payout ratio and then if we’re in a period where we really can’t find any opportunity and we have to stretch for risk to go to, you kow, our mid-teen incremental return on capital that we target, we’ll return more capital to shareholders either through substantially higher distributions of earnings or stock repurchases. But in periods where we’re seeing pronounced opportunities to accrete value to our shareholders much higher than that mid-teen internal rate, we’ll retain capital in the context of being able to do so.  The third quarter is an example where we felt we had opportunities to drive a very high teens to low-20% rate of return to our equity holders with that cash. We feel it’s beneficial to shareholders to use that cash for that purpose by also still being sensitive to making sure our cash distributions cover tax liabilities for the average shareholder of the company. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: I appreciate that. Thanks very much, guys. 
Operator:  Our next question will come from Steven Laws with Deutsche Bank. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to follow up a little bit on the competitive landscape, you know, can you talk about anything you’re seeing out of your competitors, especially those that might be impacted by leverage restrictions, especially given the asset markdowns we’ve seen at 9/30, given valuations on that day. And is that cause to any of your competitors that do have that leverage restrictions to full back or be left active from that you can tell? 
Bill Sonneborn :  Yeah, basically, the question, I think it has had an impact and you’ve also seen a couple of situations some reasonably large B regs or [inaudible] competition of portfolio sales as a result of either leverage coming due or not being replaced. And so you know, all of those kind of market technical, you take a date like September 30th was actually the lowest point this year of credit prices in the highest credit spreads available in the market. And that being a covenant or test date for any situation that has market value leverage or a total rate of return swap using to finance the condition. It has a clear and demonstrable impact.  I think the issue of where we’re seeing the least, the amount of competition going back to the market is really in the hedge fund space, predominately because it’s of concern of upcoming redemption from this current redemption cycle. So some of those players that competed with certain parts of our business have pulled back pretty pronounced. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks or comment earlier. You know, did you comment at all about where NAV or book value might stand today versus at 9/30? I haven’t had a chance to fully look through the 30-some-odd paged supplemental data so I don’t know if it’s in there or not. 
Bill Sonneborn:  We did. We mentioned that book value in the quarter of 914. You know, those prices have come back a considerable amount during the month of October, but we based it on our – the values of our acts at the end of October, we saw about a $0.35 recovery on it. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: So we’re right at about 9 ½ then as of… 
Bill Sonneborn:  Including – excluding earnings for the month. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Exactly. 
Bill Sonneborn:  That shock test on the portfolio, excluding earnings. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Great. Just a snapshot value of the 9/30 portfolio at 10/31. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Exactly. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Perfect. And then lastly, you know, and I’ll let somebody else as some questions. But you know, can you comment to the interest expense line item in the income statement? It seems like that that was lower than kind of what I was looking for and maybe give me an idea of what was going on there during the quarter? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure. You know, part of the driver of interest expense, I apologize, I’m just grabbing the interest statement now, is – if you take a look, you had – it was down a little, about 2.6 million. That is really driven by, as you know, three of our CLOs are out of reinvestment and as they have amortization of the senior bonds, that reduces the interest expense. 
Steven Laws – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. That’s helpful. I appreciate your comments and thanks for the time to answer my questions. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure. 
Operator:  And we’ll hear our next question from Amy DeBone with Compass Point Research and Trading. 
Amy DeBone – Compass Point Research and Trading: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on the quarter. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Thank you. 
Amy DeBone – Compass Point Research and Trading: So other interest income was still a little bit higher this quarter compared to the previous run rate. Was this elevated because of gains from natural resource investments or what was in this number? 
Michael McFarran:  Yeah, the other investment income of about 10.1 million was entirely natural resources. So as we talked about in our prepared remarks, you know, during – we made our first couple working interest investments and we’re prepared to be smaller, at the very end of 2010. And we made two larger acquisitions earlier to this. And there’s you know, a couple months lag to actually ramp up. And those investments are heavily focused around proving undeveloped reserves. So each month as more wells go on line and production increases, we see the increase in revenue from that. That’s why you’re seeing that big pickup to 10 million. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Basically, that’s the number [inaudible] the 28% return on invested capital on an annualized basis for the quarter. And you know, even holding commodity price is not – according to the futures curve, which is flat, that number will continue increase, as Mike mentioned, as product increases. 
Amy DeBone – Compass Point Research and Trading: Can you provide a little bit more detail on the yield pickup that you’re seeing, or no? 
Bill Sonneborn :  I’m sorry. Could you repeat that? We couldn’t quite hear you. 
Amy DeBone – Compass Point Research and Trading: Can you provide more detail on a yield pickup that you’re seeing and the CLOs that are that are still within the reinvestment period? 
Michael McFerran:  Yeah, I think Bill mentioned, you know, during the quarter you saw loan prices widen north of 200 basis points. So as we were making [inaudible] the purchases, specifically in August and September, we were able to benefit from that. As of quarter end specifically, you know, we would have expected with 11/1, you’re deploying that capital initially into a market that price is backing up so we picked up more of wider net spread than we anticipated on that deal, which increases our expectations on CLOs in general. Again, I think if you – and I don’t have the math in front of me of [inaudible] more yield than we expected entering the quarter. 
Bill Sonneborn:  And one way to think about it is if you just kind of exclude the effect of accelerated accretion, you know, as a result of refinancing transactions, which in periods of credit price deterioration, you typically have less of until you’ve made an apples-to-apples comparison say to the second quarter. Overall in our corporate debt portfolio, if you did the math, you would see an approximately 17 basis point in gross yield. On the overall portfolio, which has been driven by the capital deployed, particularly in the third quarter at much higher spreads, into [inaudible] the benefit once fully accounted for in future quarters in the overall growth yield across our platform. 
Amy DeBone – Compass Point Research and Trading: Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. 
Operator:  And we’ll hear next from Matthew Howlett with Macquarie. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: Hello, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You know, with the volitility in the leveraged loan market this quarter, I think, you know, a lot of people feel really scrutinized to see lows. My question to you is, is there sort of level where the price decline, in particular, some of your triple C pockets and some of your CLOs, would jeopardize those CO? Could you remind us again how that would function if there was a drop in triple C buckets? 
Bill Sonneborn:  And if you go to Page 27, Matthew, on the context of the troubled maturity, you’ll see that there was a substantial price decline in triple C class. In fact, triple Cs in the third quarter would be, you know, would be assets that dropped, an average around 6% in terms of triple C leveraged loans. Even with that impact on the triple C part, it really had no impact. In a number of transactions we were able to increase over collateralization. So that by itself is a factor that we don’t worry much about. We worry much more about a period when you have declining prices and high defaults because that’s the issue that we want to basically make sure that we have insulated the cash flow productivity of the business to price declines by itself, we don’t care about that much. 
Michael McFerran:  And to Bill’s point, you know, if you look at Slide 27, we put I a few extra data points this quarter because we knew it was something that people wanted to understand and get a better handle around as price moves, what does it mean to our [inaudible].  If you look at that slide, what you’ll is what our CLOs OC impressions where when they were first issued, where they were at September 15th, 2008 really as we were just entering the dark phase of the credit crisis and you’ll see with the exception of one deal, all CLOs remain pretty below OC levels that they were at when they were first issued, where we were last quarter and where we are in September. And for September, we saw not only are all five CLOs well above the OC levels that they were first issued at, but three of the five actually increased OC during the quarter.  That’s basically driven by, Matthew, Bill claims that you really need a trifecta in a very material fashion of downgrade, defaults and significant price compliance by significant, if you recall, during the fourth quarter of 2008, levered loans, you know, touched 58-59, which touched 89 or 90 as you saw in August and September and we didn’t have the same OC cushion we have today. So never say never, but we feel pretty comfortable that we have a lot of OC. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: The performance looks strong. I just wanted to double check, I know one of the deals had like 20% triple C bucket, it was sort of bigger than we see on average and just, you know, I forget which one it was, but you just don’t see any really risk at that, you know, the cushion’s big enough where it could sustain a pretty substantial drop. Is that fair to say? 
Michael McFerran: Look, I think, the exposure we have [inaudible]. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: Right. 
Michael McFerran:  Is hanging in there. We’re not concerned about this. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: Great. Okay. 
Bill Sonneborn:  It’s not as much about the number of triple Cs and more about the number of D. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: Right. Thanks. Fair enough. And then just on the topic of CLOs, you’re fully deployed on 11/1? Was that something with the timing of that that, you know, we get the full benefit of that in the quarter? And then, going forward, I mean, what is the appetite for another CLO? Could you do it in today’s marketplace? I know I think you probably placed 11/1 and then the question is, how much of your ultimate capital base do you want to have in CLO equity? How do we look at deploy capital in terms of the strategies and the other strategies versus CLO equity? 
Michael McFerran :  All really good questions. In the case of CLO 2011-1, you know, the final ramp, as we mentioned in the remarks, occurred in September right at the end of the quarter, so whether it’s cash flow production from that transaction in the third quarter, it was not the full run rate, which you’ll start to see going forward into the fourth quarter, which we imagine from that one single transaction will be somewhere in the range of a 20% higher cash income production just based upon the ramp portfolio into the fourth quarter.  On the question of how much capital is allowed to CLO equity, it really comes down to balancing where we’re seeing return opportunities, both in terms of probability of achieving a return outcome and both on the upside and on the downside relative to other investments that we make. And there’s been periods like we saw where we launched CLO 2011-1 and then upsized it when credit spreads were tight and there were fewer opportunities in some of these more kind of distressed or mezzanine assets where it was the best place to allocate capital for our shareholders in periods like now where CLO triple A spreads are wider than what we did on – for like adjusted basis by a material amount and CLO equity would be priced at something in the range of a 12 to 13% return, which is below our threshold for seeking opportunities outside of that asset class.  And we also focus on risk management and diversification because we don’t want all of our shareholder’s capital and earnings and cash flow driven either by capitated asset classes in terms of return potential or in the context of how we think about how market risk is positioned across everything we do. 
Matthew Howlett - Macquarie: That’s helpful. Thanks for answering the questions. 
Operator:  We will hear next from Michael Sarcone with Sandler O’Neill. 
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O’Neill: Hey, good afternoon, guys. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Hi, Michael. 
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O’Neill: Can you give us any color on the timing of possible issuance of unsecured debt? 
Bill Sonneborn:  I think, Michael, it may be driven by the market opportunities. You know, we mentioned we have an on-tap revolver and we have cash, so we don’t feel left to do anything. We are conscious we are – the convert out there for next July and I [inaudible] that out of the way, that will give us more capital in the current environment. So I think when the market feels right, we would do something and that could be as soon as over the next few weeks, or out in a few months. It really depends on what’s going on in the bottom margins. 
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. And then just on G&A, that came in lower this quarter than the prior. Does 8.5 million seem like a good run rate or is that, again, going to depend on the oil and natural resources? 
Bill Sonneborn:  You said it right there, Michael. The oddity of oil and gas GAAP accounting is you make an acquisition of properties, you actually have to expense all the costs related to that up front. So we’re – when we’re in a quarter where we’re actually expanding on slightly more property, [inaudible] expenses rather than capital and [inaudible].  So we didn’t purchase any incremental working interests this quarter, so we don’t have anything to expense. 
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O’Neill: Okay, thanks again. 
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Gabe Poggi with FBR. 
Gage Poggi – FBR:  Hey, good afternoon, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to kind of as an all-things-being-equal kind of question, today, kind of where we sit after the validity in 3Q kind of little rally, you know, through October. Where would you guys, across your asset platform, where do you think is the best opportunity today to allocate capital? 
Bill Sonneborn:  We still believe, and we talked about this impending supply-demand challenge, imbalance that in special situations, particularly in the context of European asset dispositions, you know, we’ve done a bunch of research and think there’s a number of approximating 1.8 trillion euros of bank deleveraging transactions that will occur over the next 24 months. That is a big supply relative to the amount of capital available to take advantage of that, which means this location, which means pretty attractive rates of return available for those that can pick which of the 1.8 trillion are the good ones. And we feel pretty well positioned, both in terms of relationships with those institutions that are net sellers of assets and our ability to find that needle in the haystack to driver high returns. I’d put that at the top of the list.  The other area where we continue to see supply demand imbalance is in the same thing we’ve done, which is the natural resources, either in the context of the 1 trillion of capital necessary to fund the shale play investments, which we would take advantage of in more of a mezzanine type opportunity or in the case of conventional oil and gas, which the majors are selling to fund their CapEx programs. That is still quite dislocated as evidenced by the 28% return in capital we’re able to generate in a couple months after deploying some. And there’s a larger supply of pipeline of opportunity than we’ve seen in a long time in that space. 
Gage Poggi – FBR: That’s helpful. Thanks, guys. 
Operator:  We’ll take your next question from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Thanks for answering my question. Most of them have been answered. Just real quick, did I hear correctly you said 625 million for purchases this quarter? 
Bill Sonneborn :  That’s correct. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies:  And then do you happen to have on hand the cost basis of kind of the pay downs or what burned off so I can look at kind of a net capital investment invested in the quarter? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Yeah, if you take a look at our par balances in our 10-Q, I don’t have that in front of me. Take a look at our 10-Q, you’ll see the par balances and the amortized cost for loans and bonds broken out. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Do you happen to have just kind of a ballpark? I mean, was that all predominately new growth there or … 
Bill Sonneborn: No, there was fail through the quarter. I think the difference is we were able to sell out of sort of positions at a higher price. And we mentioned in July, we took advantage of higher prices before credit backed up, so out of a fair number of high yield positions, we invest that capital. 
Michael McFerran:  And you asked another one about position, in the position, we had to portray a position with some very well data assets that didn’t really participate in the market decline and we were able to trade out of those and by things we know and like that really participated in the asset decline.  And so there’s a variety of actions we took in the August and September time period to increase shareholder value. 
Daniel Furtado - Jefferies: Great. All right, thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Thank you. I have a bunch of questions. Would you prefer I give them all to you in advanced and go through them one at a time, or would you like me to ask them one at a time? 
Bill Sonneborn:  I kind of like it when you just give the list of the nine and then we go through them. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors:  I only have seven. Number one, what is the significance of the recent S&P rating and your plan? Are we talking convertible debt or straight debt? Okay, and if it’s was straight debt, given your BBB rating, what kind of rate do you think you could pay for money today if you went ahead and did this deal? Or are you thinking convert? That’s question one.  I guess I’m trying to figure out, to me, the most important numbers recurring cash earnings because that kind of lies the strength of the company. So should I take, last quarter was $0.35. It dropped to $0.29. If I hear correctly, the big reason for that decline was a semi-annual interest payment. So should I assume that if I just averaged 35 and 29, that your run rate of earnings at the end of Q3 was $0.32 a quarter of cash earnings or $1.28?  And then, third, you have consistently said that even though we feel short last year, that we’re going to pay out sufficient distributions to cover tax liabilities. And then you talk about, well, you know, we’re going to keep more money in if we have great lending opportunities. But is the shareholder going to get, the average shareholder with the average cost is going to get sufficient money to pay their tax liability in 2011 when they pay Uncle Sam their money in April of 2012?  Fourth, I just wanted to reaffirm, I think when you indicated the book value – I assume, you know, you could be more forthcoming, it wouldn’t hurt you, but you guys most close your books almost daily, so you kind of know what your book value is. But what I’m implying is maybe 9 ½ plus $0.10 a month in earnings, so maybe it’s 59, 60, something like that presently, or do you have a more precise number?  Five, can you give us kind of any insight into the yield pickup? In other words, you’re taking your cash, you’re getting out of some lesser-yielding instruments into high-yielding instruments. What kind of yield pickup or what kind of money, or what I'm really trying to get at is what is your current run rate of earnings?  Then six, what is your plan to get the stock to fair value? It’s interesting, I was just kind of checking as I was in the queue to ask questions, the Bloomberg High-Yield index on December 31 was 832. Today it’s 765. The Leveraged Loan Index was 9291 on December 31. It’s now 9178, hardly changed, yet our stock is down 13% this year. And I believe with the – you guys are doing a very good job. I have confidence in your ability. You project confidence, you project knowledge. I think a 13% to 14% return on book ought to sell at least book value, and I think your book value properly analyzed, it’s probably closer to 10, you know, you could even sell at a premium to book. So we’re selling at a discount to book, we’re 20% below what I think the real book is. We’re underperforming in an up market. We’re underperforming in the indexes that would measure, you know, kind of what paper we own. So clearly, people don’t understand us . So we either – is that structure or a failure to communicate? You know, like a Paul Newman, we got wrapped in the head and failure to communicate. Do we have a plan to get the stock to fair value? And is there any forward-looking comments you could make because you do a great job of analyzing the past, but you’re very candid, you know, very guarded in terms of kind of run rate of earnings looking out and so on and so forth. But you do project optimism. I’m not trying to be critical because you know I’ve been very complimentary to your performance.  So is that enough questions or do you want some more? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Those are all good ones. And you know, in the typical fashion, we’ll answer them and we’ll probably create a couple more. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Good. I’ve got plenty of time. 
Bill Sonneborn:  In terms of difference of the ratings being investment grade, you know, I think we had foreshadowed in previous conversations with you all that our intent was to focus on creating an opportunity to lower our overall cost of capital to bring down the whack if you will, the average cost of capital in the business where we can continue to find the [inaudible] of opportunities we have even through the CLO marketplace with the other capital we’re allocating and driving even higher returns on capital to our shareholders to be able to grow what is a 12% real cash return on equity over time.  And that’s not going to happen through issuing convertible debt just in the context of a yield-based business, that’s an expensive part of capital to raise because of how the dividend yield affects effectively the conversion premium. So the goal is to have no equity embedded warrants attached to the financing we raise. As Mike mentioned, make sure that we’re financing ourselves from a term perspective but we’re not taking maturity risk and have reasonable length of capital in order to take advantage of opportunities and keep that lower cost of capital for a long period of time.  And from that perspective, you know, it depends on the context of the maturity as you kind of move out the swap curve as to what that cost is. And there’s periods of time when financial services is more inept to being able to adapt to capital markets than others. And you know, one of the things opportunistically we want to focus on is when’s the right time to tap those markets from both the perception of the underlying investors inability to get, again, the lowest weighted average cost to capital possible in the context of embedding the ability on the right hand side of the balance sheet to drive the left hand side of the balance sheet rate returns for our shareholders.  And your second question, return cash earnings, you kind of did that math and $0.32, that assumes just on the weighted average that we didn’t accrete any cash flow production during the quarter. So you said $0.32 and yeah, I’d say that’s a little shy because hopefully we took some actions in August and September that would mean the run rate today is higher than that $0.32. But that’s a reasonable basis to do the math.  In terms of your third question on paying out these distributions, you know, at the partnership level, you know, taking all the shareholders in the partnership, it is our intent, and we’ve made this clear, to make sure that we get enough cash either through the sum total of our regular quarterly distributions and/or the ability to do a special distribution in the first quarter of the following year to make sure our shareholders at the partnership level have effectively been treated with cash to pay any liabilities associated with the Federal or State government in which they reside. So that is still our stated objective.  On book value, Mike went through the math. We’ve historically, for guidance, not provided a lot of forward-looking or up-to-date information. We actually push counsel a little bit in the context of this quarter to give you some more live real-time data. But it’s not our practice to be out publically stating every day what our book value is or earnings are until – you know, I understand why that’s important and relevant, but from our perspective, we’d rather be managing the business and not having to speak to investors everyday as to what those results are. And so, Mike pointed to the fact that book value is accretive substantially and that’s just on the basis of the available for sale instruments as well as securities in the context of high yield and the appreciation that’s occurred through the month of October. And you obviously have to add some level of earnings, and I think your math was reasonable in the context of how you described it.  Your fifth question, in terms of yield pickup, we talked about, basically, on the gross yield side about an affect in the third quarter of about 17 basis points of yield during that quarter, but that’s not obviously a full run rate impact, so that number is higher in terms of gross yield on our corporate credit across special situations with our bank loans and high-yield finance and CLOs and the like, until our goal is even though we are paying down some liabilities through principal pay downs and certain of our CLOs that we’re accreting through a weighted-average higher spread than floors to offset – more than offset that impact like we’ve seen caught in this last quarter to continue from that part of our business a healthy cash flow while we’re driving cash flow through our natural resources special situations and the like.  And then finally, in the context of your point, related to driving shareholder action and interest in the context of getting our stock to fair value as opposed to below fair value, you know, it’s definitely something we spend a lot of time thinking about, I do, as a shareholder.  I think there’s two things that we’ve encountered this year and in particular the last quarter. One is being classified in the financial services space, which by its nature has not been a good place to be regardless of the financial performance earnings powering cash generation of the business. You get tagged with the black flag, if you will and there’s not much we can do about that other than continued to be transparent in the context of our balance sheet and our earnings and the context of discussions like this and financial reporting, and to reach out and have discussions with investors one-on-one and speak at conferences so they understand our business model to the extensive nature of certain aspects of things we do. And really what the real risks are that we worry about as opposed to the supposed risks and rumors that people sometimes get caught up in.  And we’re focused on long-term shareholder value, you know. Obviously we know shareholders are impatient and want, you know, near-term stock price in their bank accounts. But you know, really, we want to be measured over a couple years in terms of how we produce that and how we communicate that.  I know Mike and I talk about that a lot and we’ve stepped up our communications to shareholder to understand the method. I know the analysts that have participated in this call, we appreciate their coverage, but that is an ongoing effort. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Thank you. The answers were as good as the questions. 
Operator:  And we do have another question from Wayne Cooperman with Cobalt. 
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: I’ll just stick to one question. Just what’s the size of the interest rate swap loss in the quarter? Is that a permanent impairment or temporary impairment and how does that affect – you know, jive with what we’re hedging against? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Yeah, the interest rate swap, there’s no P&L fact, all the way through, either comprehensive incomes or designated cash flow hedges. We mentioned OCI has come back about $0.35 since quarter end, the end of October. A decent part of that was those swaps. Again, not a monetized loss. 
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: If OCI came back and it’s mostly due to the interest rate swap, I thought the marks on your loans would come back a lot too? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Wayne, the difference – the distinction is loans are not – don’t – are not carried at fair value, so they don’t go with the book. Book value is going to be the bonds and the interest rate swap. So it’s not most the interest rate swap, when I say it came back $0.35, a meaningful part of that was the interest rate swap.  In other words. We swapped fixed rate to floating rate within our structures and so any sort of tightening of the ten-year treasury has an impact on book value and if ten-year treasury rates rise, that reversus for us. There’s no permanent impairment. 
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: Right. Okay. 
Operator:  We do have another question. We’ll take that from Joel Montgomery with Cobalt Capital. 
Joel Montgomery – Cobalt Capital: Sorry, just one other question. During the quarter, Moody’s upgraded some of the notes in CLLO5Q to AAA. I was wondering if there’s any benefit to KFN from this, or to the potential earnings from that CLL? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure. Good question, Joel. The tranches have been upgraded. For our CLO’s what we call our restricted trading condition, which means for the CLOs, 05-1, 05-2 and 07-A, we try to reinvest in period, technically, subject to other tasks, we invest some unscheduled principal proceeds including proceeds from sales. For 05-2 and 07-A, [inaudible] for those two deals also have a weighted average life test that you’re restricted by, for a more practical standpoint, while there’s you know, there’s always a chance you may reinvest something, but it’s not likely. For 05-1, there’s probably a little more opportunity that would be dependent upon – it would be shorter data for that, but there would probably be some opportunities for [inaudible]. 
Joel Montgomery – Cobalt Capital: Okay. And also, you talked about the opportunity from over $1 trillion of potential European bank dispositions coming over the next year or two, and I’m sure those are going to come from across a number of asset classes and we’re just wondering if what you said, what you thought was most interesting was corporate credit or if it was something else and if you plant to focus on dollar denominated assets? 
Bill Sonneborn:  Yeah, in the 1.8 trillion euro asset disposition number that we researched, a good portion of that actually are dollar-denominated assets but not all. And so we’re just as comfortable as I think financials [inaudible] euro-denominated assets when we hedge back to $1 because we want to avoid making currency bets because that’s not, you know, I guess our core competence. So the answer is, a lot of those are corporate. Some of those are distressed real estate mortgage assets. Some of those are either whole business securitizations that have kind of a real estate and an operating company component all of which in a number of these cases are businesses, we as a firm know, and our manager knows really well. 
Joel Montgomery – Cobalt Capital: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. 
Operator:  And that is all the questions we have today. I’d like to turn the conference over to Bill Sonneborn for any additional closing remarks. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Thank you. And thank you all for listening today in the busy earnings season. We’ll get back to work and try to put together a good quarter for you. Thanks. 
Operator:  Once again, this does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Angela Yang. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Angela Yang: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Angela Yang, Head of Investor Relations for KKR Financial Holdings LLC. And joining me on the call today are Bill Sonneborn, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating and Financial Officer. This afternoon's call is being webcast on our website at www.kkr.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call available as well. Our financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011 were issued today. And as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we get started, I would like to caution you that this conference call and webcast contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of operations of the company as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website on www.sec.gov. KFN's actual results may vary materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In addition, some of the discussion today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures as well as their corresponding GAAP reconciliations may be found in the supplemental information packet available on our website. The supplemental information packet on our website includes information that we will be referring to on our call today. And we encourage you to have this information available during the call. With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Sonneborn.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Angela. And thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I'll begin my remarks with highlights of the quarter followed by an update on the business as we look ahead. And later on I will discuss how we believe we have positioned KFN to perform in the current macro environment. For the purpose of this call, we suggest you refer to the supplemental information packet Angela described, which is available on our website. We fortunately had a good quarter during a period that was in many ways a replay of the second quarter of last year, Greece dominating headlines combined with U.S. fiscal concerns, albeit a year ago, was focused on the municipal and not treasury markets or ISM numbers. I am pleased with the momentum across our different strategies where we continue to execute above expectations. And believe the capital we are continuing to deploy today will represent a substantial opportunity to generate significant value for our shareholders in the future. So with that, I'll start with the highlights of the quarter, which are listed on Page 2, of our supplemental presentation. We were able to produce another strong quarter of financial results. Specifically, we generated $0.59 in earnings per diluted share, representing a 24% return on equity. This compares to $0.51 of earnings per diluted share for both the first quarter of 2011 and second quarter of 2010. Earnings for the current quarter included income tax provision of $7.4 million, primarily related to an unrealized gain we took on a private equity investment, which we carry at estimated fair value that hold within a corporate blocker subsidiary. The accrued tax expense related to this investment represented a deferred tax liability that was a non-cash event during the quarter and reduced earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.04. Run rate cash earnings per share for the second quarter totaled $0.36 per share and total net cash earnings per share was $0.35 per share. Total and run rate cash earnings per share represented 14% cash return on equity. Run rate cash earnings per share and total net cash earnings per share are two key non-GAAP metrics that Mike and I focus on, as they represent cash that we could either distribute to our shareholders or retain and reinvest for future growth. Next on to our book value. As of June 30th, our book value per share was $9.91, which represents an increase of $1.83 per share or 23% from $8.08 per share a year ago. As contain in our earnings release filed today, on July 28th, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $0.18 per common share. This represents our seventh consecutive quarterly increase in our cash distribution to shareholders and an increase of 50% from the $0.12 declared for the second quarter of 2010. Now, an update on our portfolio and targeted capital allocation. The excess in the fair value of our corporate debt portfolio with carrying value, equates today to about a $1.28 per share from the corporate debt portfolio. The $1.28 per share excess of our corporate debt portfolio, its fair value over carrying value as of June 30th, doesn't include changes in the values of our natural resource strategy non-financial assets, which consist of working and overriding royalty interests in various oil and gas properties. As of June 30th, we estimate the fair value of these holdings to be approximately $39.6 million higher than their carrying value or an additional $0.22 per share. With respect to our strategies, I'll start with our bank loan and high-yield strategy, which as you know, we primarily execute through CLO technology, as a funding mechanism. As previously announced, in early July, we upsized CLO 2011-1 from a $400 million secured financing transaction with $600 million secured financing transaction. CLO 2011-1 initially closed on March 31st and represented a private CLO transaction, executed between us and an unexcavated third party financial institution. We are pleased we were able to upsize this transaction, as it represents an all-in cost of financing that is lower than the tightest priced CLOs we have seen execute in the market, and provided the structure that provides less downside risk to us and our shareholders. Mike will take you through the specifics of this later in the call. A summary of the portfolio statistics has ramped through June 30th is contained on Page 22 of the supplemental material. Next, our natural resources strategy, which consist of deploying capital to oil and gas opportunities by acquiring working interest in conventional and unconventional producing properties. Royalty interest in both producing properties and unconventional resource developments and private equity, primarily oil and gas and mid-stream infrastructure related transactions. We are currently in an expansionary phase with our natural resource strategy and continue to focus on identifying future opportunities, broadly in the sector. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of properties located in the Barnett Shale from Carrizo Oil & Gas totaling $55.4 million that's partially financed through an incremental borrowing of just shy of $20 million under our non-recourse oil and gas credit facility. The majority of the reserves acquired through this transaction are proved undeveloped or PUDs and are expected to be developed over the next two years. In addition to deploying incremental capital this quarter, our existing investments made in natural resources are generating positive results for the company. Specifically, we have entered into an agreement to sell our $10 million investment in Hilcorp Resources Holdings, made just over a year ago for 2.7 times of purchase price or $27 million to Marathon Oil Corporation. This sale was expected to settle during the fourth quarter. Additionally, at the quarter end, we estimated the fair value of our $55 million overriding royalty interest acquired during the first quarter of this year at a fair value of 1.7 times cost or $93.5 million. Our Mezzanine strategy continues to perform well. During the quarter we received repayment on a $7.2 million mezz investment in a U.S. retailer we made in late 2010 that generated over a 21% IRR. And during the quarter, we deployed no incremental capital to this strategy, but currently as a result of credit markets weakening, have a robust pipeline of very interesting potential investments in Europe, the U.S. and Australia. And we will keep you posted. Our special situation strategy continues to perform well. And during the quarter we deployed approximately $30 million to a mix of secondary market opportunities, predominately related to purchasing individual stress and distress positions from European bank balance sheets, as they accelerate this positions of non-core assets. As of June 30th, our portfolio of special situations investments has generated a gross IRR of approximately 20% over the past 18 months. Finally, I will conclude with our private equity strategy to which we primarily participate on a side-by-side basis with KKR's private equity funds in select investments. During the quarter, we committed to deploy an aggregate $20 million of capital. The KKRs buyout of Academy Sports + Outdoors, a premier sports outdoor and lifestyle retailer based in Texas; and Capsugel, a leading provider of pharmaceutical and dietary capsule, and an innovator in drug-delivery systems, and the acquisition of that business from Pfizer. In addition to these targeted asset classes, we are also actively pursuing a variety of opportunities for a commercial real estate strategy, and are currently evaluating specific opportunity for acquisitions of performing and underperforming European commercial mortgage assets from banks that are being required to divest to these holdings in a specified time period. We are optimistic about the return opportunities identified in these transactions, and will continue to provide you with updates on the strategy as it evolves. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael McFerran: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon everyone. I'll begin my section of today's call with a review of our result. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.59, which translates to a 24% return on GAAP equity. For the quarter, investment income totaled a $135.8 million, which represents an 11% a year-over-year increase. And net investment income totaled $88.7 million, which represents a 16% a year-over-year increase. Total investment income to the quarter includes $12.3 million of discount accretion income, while prepayments as compared to $9.5 million for the corresponding prior-year period. Other investment income for the quarter totaled $11.1 million, and consists of $4.5 million of dividend income, primarily from a private equity investment. And $6.6 million of income from both our working interest and royalty interest in oil and gas properties. The income generated by these natural resource holdings was offset by $6.9 million of related expenses during the quarter, and comparatively higher level of expenses when measured against the revenues, it's primarily due to transaction expenses incurred in connection of the acquisition of oil and gas working interest, which are accounted for as business combinations under GAAP. And as a result, we acquired other transaction related cost we expensed rather than capitalized. As Bill mentioned, we are in an expansionary phase with our national resources strategy. With regards to our existing holdings, we expect revenues steadily increase, as production increases through drilling of underdeveloped or undeveloped properties, and related expenses to decrease at certain acquisition and transaction costs are non-recurring and expensed upfront. I do want to highlight that during periods of property acquisitions, higher expenses are to be expected. A significant driver of this quarter's net income was total other income of $62.6 million, which is a $39.4 million increase from total other income of $23.2 million for the second quarter of 2010. Total other income was primarily driven from realized gains totaling $52.6 million from the sales of certain holdings during the quarter. In addition, we had a $10 million unrealized gain related to the appreciation of value in our investment and Hilcorp, which as Bill mentioned, we've entered in an agreement to sell during the fourth quarter of this year. Our cash flows for the quarter were also strong with run rate cash earnings of $0.36 per share and total net cash earnings of $0.35 per share. Run rate cash earnings per share of $0.36 equates to a 14% cash return on equity, and is $0.09 higher than $0.27 of run rate cash earnings per share for the first quarter of this year. There are a few tiny differences that I do want to highlight related to cash earnings in order to put this increase in the context. First, during the first quarter we paid $12.8 million of semi-annual interest expense in our convertible notes, which is not included in our second quarter number. Second, interest expense from our CLOs was approximately $5 million higher than the first quarter, due to semi-annual bond payments received in our CLOs during the first quarter. Accordingly, on a normalized basis our run rate cash earnings per share is approximately $0.30. Next, our balance sheet and capital structure. As of June 30th, our book value per share was $9.91, which represents an increase of $0.18 per share from $9.73 per share as of March 31st, and an increase of $1.83 per share from $8.08 per share a year ago. One metric that Bill highlighted, I want to spend a minute on, is the fair value of our portfolio. As of June 30th, the weighted averaged estimated fair value of our corporate debt portfolio was 95% of the aggregate. $7.85 billion par value of our loan and bond holdings, which is $227.4 million higher than the weighted averaged carrying value of this holdings on our balance sheet for which our book value per share is based or is 92% of par. This differential results $1.28 of fair value per share, embedded in our balance sheet above our reported book value. Historical turning of our book value per share and the fair value of our corporate debt portfolio are detailed on Pages 4 and 5 of our supplemental presentation. The differential between the carrying value of our corporate debt portfolio and its estimated fair value is a consequence of lower accounting on our GAAP. Specifically, loans held for investments are carried at amortized cost less than allowance for credit losses. And loans held for sale are carried at the lower amortized cost or fair value. We ended the quarter with $281.7 million of unrestricted cash and similar to last quarter we have no borrowings outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility. The increase in cash from $129.3 million as of March 31 is due to proceeds received during the quarter from CLO 2011-1 and proceeds from the dispositions of certain corporate debt positions not held in CLOs during the quarter. As for our capital structure, last quarter we mentioned that given the current low-rate environment, we're exploring opportunities for incremental capital in the debt capital markets as an efficient way to allow weighted average cost of capital. As we have sufficient dry powder from cash and through our credit facility, we aren't pressed to do anything today, but rather our focus on value and strategic alternative for longer-term capital growth as we continue to invest in the business. In addition, we believe our liquidity position will enable us to meet near-term debt obligations, specifically the $180.6 million outstanding and to our 7% converts that mature in July 2012. With respect to capital management, we use CLOs as a primary mechanism to deploy capital to our bank loan and high-yield strategy. As previously announced, the upsized CLO 2011-1 after quarter-end from being a $400 million transaction to $600 million secured financing transaction. CLO 2011-1, already closed on March 31 of this year, is a $400 million transaction whereby we financed a portfolio of senior secured loans with 3-to-1 leverage provided by a senior investor at a rate of LIBOR plus 135 basis points. The $200 million upsize was structured through the senior investor, increasing their commitment to buy $150 million from $300 million to $450 million. And that increases our equity interest in the transaction from $100 million to $150 million. The additional increase in the size of CLO 2011-1, the amount of the transaction to allow sales of credit improved rather than just credit impaired loans and reduce the par value ratio test which is equivalent to the over-collateralization test for our other CLOs, 133.7% to 120% and last extend the maturity of the transaction from April to August of 2018. CLO 2011-1 is a uniquely structured transaction that we find to be structurally and economically beneficial, especially as compared to recent CLO transactions executed in the market. Specifically, our senior financing cost with returns of leverage priced higher than recent deals executed in the market with recent triple-A issues having a discount margin in the LIBOR plus 125 range. But in terms of leverage, these transactions have a cost of debt of approximately LIBOR plus 140. In addition to having a slightly tighter cost of financing CLO 2011-1 has comparatively lower transaction cost as compared to traditional CLOs which require higher expenses for book lenders, rating agencies, marketing road shows and account of letter. CLO 2011-1 had comparatively little or none of these expenses. And factoring the impact of these incremental transaction costs on the total financing cost of the transactions, CLO 2011-1 is economically advantageous compared to deals we're seeing in the market. Similarly, we find CLO 2011-1 to be structurally advantageous compared to structures we see executed today. Specifically, there are two key differences that provide us with a downside protection that we wouldn't have in traditionally structured CLO transaction. First, subject to maintaining compliance with the par value ratio test, we receive our pro rata share of all principle proceeds. This enables us to maintain a fairly constant IRR on our capital throughout the life of the transaction. Comparatively, in traditional CLOs, all senior debt is repaid prior to equity owners receiving principle-backed which results in a declining IRR profile. Second, we have the ability to call this transaction six months after the initial ramp period. This supports thus the flexibility to replace it as spreads and maturity tighten. Last, our CLO 2011 is comprised of static pool loans, because they'll be invested in period. These structured provisions give us the downside risk protection that we desire when we execute a transaction like this. If spreads widen, then low repayments should be low, and we'd be able to maintain a mid-teens IRR for the next several years. If spreads tighten while repayments will likely accelerate, we'll have capital returned to us without being pressured to reinvest at lower asset spreads of higher liability cost. As for the future, we do see structural features in traditional CLOs becoming more attractive in shorter non-call periods and longer reinvestment periods. We are continuously working on our future transactions whether they are private deals like CLO 2011-1 or traditionally weighted market CLOs like we had executed in the past. With that, I'm going to hand this back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Mike. Consistent with my remarks last quarter, our business has increasing momentum driven by a multi-faceted strategy for deploying in various areas and specific transactions where we see the best opportunities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and future cash flow to our shareholders. Needless to say, we're operating at an unstable economic environment as we witness the cross-Atlantic saga play out between the U.S. debt ceiling and deficit challenges and the sovereign debt issues in Europe combined with the continued inflationary pressures in emerging markets and the slowing U.S. economy. We expect most markets in which we operate will experience increasing volatility/ With that backdrop, we're well positioned to perform. This is a dramatic difference than it was in December 2008. Heading into that credit crisis and economic weakening, we're faced with asset class concentration, low liquidity, refinancing concerns and over $2 billion of mark-to-market liability risk requiring margin to be posted. KFN is different today and all us at KKR are working to realize the opportunity that KFN presents to us and to our fellow shareholders. With that, I'll open this call for questions. Operator, if you could please open it up for questions please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Michael Sarcone with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill: How are free payments trending so far this quarter?
Michael McFerran: We've, as you've seen, credit backup a little bit. We've definitely seen a decline in prepayments than what we were experiencing late in the first quarter, early part of the second quarter. But it can be episodic at times for specific transactions.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill: Could you give us your current exposure to foreign currencies?
Michael McFerran: Yes, it's can be disclosed in our 10-Q which we'll be filing later this week. I think it's disclosed in our last 10-Q. A little less than 4% of our total balance sheet was denominated in foreign currency, and we do hedge most of that. While we continue to place some capital to foreign opportunities, as Bill referenced, especially sub-strategy, it doesn't make up a material portion of our total portfolio.
Bill Sonneborn: We're dollar based. So we hedge that risk.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O'Neill: I thought there was no loan loss provision this quarter. Any thought or change in thought on keeping the reserve level constant? I think it's around 3.4% as you grow the portfolio.
Michael McFerran: Obviously if you think about on a bottoms-up and top-down basis, every quarter as to what the prudent amount of what the loss reserves should be and whether or not an additional provision is warranted, and those kind of sometimes offset each other. Where top-down, you could be much more cautious than the bottoms-up, really drive in terms of results. So this particular quarter, you see no additional provision predominantly because bottoms-up credit risk in terms of looking at our underlying positions and where they stand feels really good, even though we had loan growth during the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Kwok with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I guess first I want to touch upon the fair value. I was wondering decline in fair value, was that due to just the general mark-to-market or is there issues like credit or investments related?
Bill Sonneborn: It's really two things. One, there is a little bit of backing up in asset prices. And second, we did, as you'll see from our large realized gains during the quarter, we did divest a fair amount of bond holdings that were carried at a price well above par. Some of it was just related to realized and some of the higher price of assets.
Michael McFerran: We reduced our high yield exposure during the quarter just as part of risk management, which resulted in realized gains occurring and therefore the fair market value too, the carrying value spread reduced a little bit.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Last quarter, the difference between fair value and carrying value was close to like $2. In this quarter, it's $1.28. I was just wondering if fair value goes back towards what it was last quarter, would that gap narrow back to the $2 range?
Bill Sonneborn: It really depends on our specific assets. We're purchasing things now as a result of credit market's weakness. They directly shouldn't trade where they are based on the risk. And so theoretically, yes, the answer is that is possible. So you could revert to a carrying value, fair value adjustment. That was on the corporate debt portfolio. We talked about $0.22 roughly of fair value market value versus carrying value in our natural resources investments, which you can add to the number for the quarter. But when you think about the portfolio, we buy stuff when it trades down, and then it should revert to historical normal values and that should drive additional spread between fair value and carrying value.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I noticed that G&A was kind of high this quarter. I was wondering what's a more normal level of G&A? Can you talk about some of the one-time items that perhaps drove it this quarter?
Michael McFerran: I mean most notably it is related to, as we mentioned the call, the oil and gas working interest acquisitions. Most notably, we acquired $55.4 million of working interest. Under GAAP, we have to see expense, not capitalize all acquisition cost. So they are a bit episodic. I would expect that number probably running $2 million to $3 million higher than you would see in the quarter if those activities didn't occur. I believe I want to highlight that in periods where we make acquisitions, you're going to see some higher expense as a result. All that really helped the effect on us not having capitalized expenses, but be amortized during the life of the deal.
Bill Sonneborn: If we don't do an additional natural resource investment, you'll see decline in G&A and pickup in earnings from the strategy in future quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabe Poggi with FBR.
Gabe Poggi - FBR: I wanted to ask you a kind of 20000-foot question. You guys both mentioned that you're in expansionary phase in the natural resources segment of your business. I assume that that means that's where you guys are finding the most relative value now. Is that a safe assumption? Or asked a different way, where are you guys finding the most relative value in a very volatile environment?
Michael McFerran: I think we've been in expansionary phase in the context of natural resources. We haven't done anything to decrease our transactions we announced at the end of last quarter. And I think that's indicative of seeing opportunities as a result of economic weakening and general credit price declines. But there is aspects within credit now which we find even more attractive than on which we're focused at the end of the first quarter. So that ebbs and flows. And so we've been deploying more capital both through our CLOs and credit as a result of new issue loan spreads kind of widening by around 100 basis points over the past four weeks, which drives some very attractive returns for our shareholders both in our legacy CLOs and in CLO 2011-1.
Gabe Poggi - FBR: You guys talked about continue to having conversations in Europe regarding maybe commercial real estate investments there. Can you put a little more color around that? And specifically, is there a targeted exposure you'd like? I don't think you guys have mentioned this in the past. But just curious if an amazing deal came down the pipeline and KKR were to win that bid, would you be willing to make it a bigger number here, 5%, 8% of kind of your allocated capital?
Michael McFerran: We've had risk limits that we've instituted both in the context of underlying investment exposures, geographic exposures and the like, and that obviously also relates to commercial real estate. And our focus in commercial real estate in terms of the activities we're pursuing is predominantly in income-producing situations where we have high cash on cash returns to our shareholders as opposed to more private equity long-duration development type transactions. And specifically in Europe, where we are seeing opportunities, what we talked about last quarter which is the general bank deleveraging which is actually kind of accelerating even faster than we had anticipated as a result of sovereign exposure amongst number of the banks that we're in discussions with. And when you look at their portfolios, being inside and going through their book, a very large amount of exposures to commercial real estate assets both performing and non-performing loans. And so in conjunction with our real estate team at the manager, we are spending a lot of time taking advantage of the ability to look for those situations where on a proprietary basis as opposed to an auction format we can structure something that makes sense for our shareholders.
Gabe Poggi - FBR: Are the assets you're looking at in CRE? Are the actual assets a combination of here domestically and also in Europe? Is there a mix?
Michael McFerran: Yes, generally there is a mix.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: First just to make sure I am clear, it looks like the Hilcorp gain you expect to take the realized gain in Q4, but have you already recognized $10 million of that on a fair valuation basis already?
Michael McFerran: That's exactly right, John.
Bill Sonneborn: That shows up as an unrealized gain in the financial statement as of the second quarter, and then that will be converted to cash in the fourth quarter, when Marathon's transaction closes.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: The upsized CLO 2011 already deployed with the upsides, or have you already deployed all the capital?
Bill Sonneborn: We're pretty far along in that. It's not done, but we are getting pretty close.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: What is the character of assets that you're finding for the CLO?
Michael McFerran: It's a senior secured loan named U.S. loans, similar to what you see in other CLOs.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: Obviously, the counterparty appreciates working you wanted to increase the size. Can you then engage in that kind of activity with them depending on the opportunities you find?
Michael McFerran: Whether with them or other counterparties, we definitely think there is opportunities to keep exploring these private CLO-type transactions. We're receiving a lot of interest in it.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: You have talked about the opportunities that you're waiting for in Europe, and it sounds like they're CRE-focused. How would you finance that? Would the bank facility be the primary vehicle initially for that?
Michael McFerran: No, we don't think of our credit facility as something to finance longer-duration assets. So any of those type of portfolio transaction is to be financed independently, whether through a CLO-type structure with seller-based term financing or the like.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jasper Burch with Macquarie.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: Just a couple of quick questions; first, on the CLO 2011-1. Looking at it, just wanted to make sure does the reinvestment period still end on 9/30? And then second, the $70 million of bank loans that you have on your balance sheet, do those not fit into that CLO, or can you sell them into it?
Michael McFerran: Some of the assets you saw on our balance sheet at quarter-end are going over to it as a small amount. And the rest are going to be held for future transactions. As far as the ramp-up period, it'll be done by September 30.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: And then on 2005-1 and 2005-2, it looked like more premiums on this specifically. I'm looking at when you might call them. And then also, it looked like the OC on 2005-1 came down slightly. Was there anything going on there that we should think about?
Michael McFerran: No, I mean those CLO '05 like the '05-1 OC is still well in excess of where it was when we did the deal. So we feel very, very comfortable with the OC level. That's just more a function of buying and selling of assets; and sometime, especially assets we had bought towards the end of the crisis in the low to mid-80s. We maybe divesting other times which eats a little bit of that OC, but nothing that we're uncomfortable with. As far as calling those two deals, and they are both generating now high-teens low-20 cash IRRs, we're very pleased with their performance. And as prepayments in the lower market feel pretty slow at the moment, I don't think there is anything in the near term that needs to be done.
Bill Sonneborn: Our philosophy on that, Jasper, today has been consistent. The returns to our shareholders dropped kind of from high-teens, as Mike mentioned, down to mid-teens would be to call and refinance or amended expense.
Jasper Burch - Macquarie: It looks like the allowance for loan loss and your corporate loans actually came down for the second consecutive quarter. And if you're looking at that on a bottoms-up basis, I was just wondering were there specific transactions that improved in credit quality, and why did you decrease that allowance?
Michael McFerran: Notably, it's about 3.1% this quarter-end and I think a little closer to 3.4% last quarter. As we said in the last few quarters, the portfolio is performing very well. We have what we consider as very prudent reserve that we think frankly provide from a combination as we've grown the portfolio a bit. There is nothing to cause a concern. We did divest some amounts of holdings that we had a little more concern around compared to others.
Bill Sonneborn: If you look at Page 15 and you compare it to the supplemental materials in the last quarter and you do a compare and contrast the general largest holdings this quarter versus last quarter, and to Mike's point, you'll see that it moved to available-for-sale and therefore charged up against the reserve a number of our large concentrated positions to the point where our top 50 holdings as a percent of our total is at the lowest point since the early 2005.
Operator: Our next question will come from Amy DeBone with Compass Point Research & Trading.
Amy DeBone - Compass Point Research & Trading: Can you give a quick update on any yield pickup that you're seeing in the two legacy CLOs that are still within the reinvestments periods?
Michael McFerran: As we're seeing opportunities to redeploy capital from principal repayment, we're seeing more deals clearly in the prime areas which has slowed down quite a bit with LIBOR floors, which continues to benefits the CLOs. And prices have come, backed up a little a bit to, Bill mentioned, that 100 basis range. So we are seeing some yield benefit.
Amy DeBone - Compass Point Research and Trading: Okay. And then also just to clarify in terms of the reason that the loan portfolio declined this quarter is because you were moving loans to available-for-sale, correct?
Michael McFerran: The allowance for loan losses, because we moved some incremental loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale, the overall loan portfolio actually increased during the quarter.
Operator: And we'll go next to Stephen Laws with Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to touch on I guess kind of looking at Page 16. I know just referenced 15 in the supplemental deck. As we look at how this shifts a little bit, it looks like more activity in healthcare, education, chemicals and plastics and I guess retail and a couple of sectors, and it looked like their mix has decreased over the last three months. Is that really a function more of the pipeline on the OCC, or is that a conscious decision you guys are making to target specific industry investments and possibly avoid others? And if that's the case, can you may be shed a little light on that please?
Bill Sonneborn: Steven, we don't really topic from a macro perspective the broad, we'll call it, S&P GICS industry classifications other than to look at them to make sure that we're diversified from a risk perspective. So within each of these broad industry classifications, there are so many different sub-sectors and sub-industries that have completely different correlations to one another. That's really where the rubber meets the road. And so we're looking at issuer-specific risk and their individual sub-sector industry relative to other opportunities and other specific industries and trying to create diversity across each of these industry classifications and their ultimate sub-classifications; and then look at it as we build that up as to what that overall risk exposure is, both directly and indirectly to things relating to such as commodities or to government procurement either domestically or abroad to the consumer in terms of discretionary and the like. So hope that answers your question.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Can you maybe take a second and just look at some of the larger macro issues both here with debt ceiling and then obviously in Europe with some sovereign debt concerns over there. And maybe talk to how those larger macro risk factors kind of what you guys do day-to-day or as far as how you're managing a portfolio to take into consideration those kind of large micro events?
Bill Sonneborn: Certainly, I think we're generally trying to stay away, because of the growth of our security programs globally spreading from Europe now into the U.S. government, as the safety source of expense to drive the economy. And moving more into business-to-business type of risk where, we actually see some pretty descent held. We remain somewhat cautious on consumer discretionary, because until you start to see more stabilization, particularly in the U.S. and this is true also internationally in Europe of residential real estate. We think there'll be a cautious consumer, particularly from a discretionary perspective. And we're starting to see some positive signs there. You see that in U.K. today, particularly in the London market. And we are starting to see that in places for field from New York and San Francisco, for some stabilization in U.S. residential real estate, and particularly on the rental side and now in the home-owner side. That's when we start to get a little more bullish on a consumer discretionary. But generally speaking, we think austerity as it's kind of laid out will have a dampening effect on global economies, reflect interest rate to stay relatively low for at least the next 18 to 24 months through the election cycle. We don't think anything draconian necessarily is going to happen. But we've built-in enough tail hedge protection in how we've designed the balance sheet in our portfolio to sleep well at night regardless of what happens.
Stephen Laws - Deutsche Bank: Yes, you guys have done a good job with that. And I guess lastly kind of round that out, maybe if you can touch on any discussion or even no concerns or worries with your credit facilities in order to really small number here for the quarter. But just any discussion you had given general concerns in the market in the U.S. for the last few weeks about financing availability. Just any general comment on that, although I know you guys really don't use any recourse financing. But any discussion you had with your counter parties?
Michael McFerran: Yes, we definitely benefit in new highlight of this from not using short-term, and especially it's not short-term mark-to-market financing. But frankly with the amount of cash we have and our underlying credit facility, we feel pretty comfortable. We don't need half in short-term people or swap markets for financing. As Bill alluded to earlier, other more strategic asset purchases, whether they're down from our national resources strategy or from commercial real estate, have financing embedded either through a non-recourse facility that entered into simultaneous with the acquisition of the investment or by seller provided financing. That's what the banks are thinking from lending, I'd have to differ to them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Perhaps, three questions. In terms of looking at the company from top-down picture, the run rate of cash earnings is somewhere in the $0.35 to $0.36 area. So that $1.40 plus run rate, the div you just declared is $0.72, I guess it is 18 times for $0.76. So you roughly were paying out 50% earnings or retaining 50%. Is the model that you are looking at presently is something like we have a stock yielding between 7% and 8%, and we think we can grow this enterprise to retain the earnings by another 7?
Bill Sonneborn: That's correct.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: There was a number thrown at $0.30. What was the difference between $0.30 and $0.36?
Bill Sonneborn: Lee, what we said was there's a bit of volatility in that cash earnings number. It's related to debt service. So while we said, run rate earnings this quarter was $0.36 on a normalized basis. And we've wanted to caution people, it's really a $0.30 number.
Michael R. McFerran: I think it's actually in between that once we take out the converts next year. We're earning nothing on cash, we think 7% on the converts that we're paying off in the year.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: That's my second question. If you take $180.6 million out of the equation, if you took your unemployed capital or underemployed capital and your unrestricted cash, and subtract it. Let's say you're minimum required cash that you would have in mind to run the business and you took that sum of money and you applied your current marginal lending rate. How much additional earnings do you think you it could be generating? I don't know, do you followed the question?
Michael McFarren: We do. I mean we think about it as, I'll let Bill talk about how he thinks about strategically. But I mean we deploy capital with a strategy, so whether it's the CLOs natural resources, commercial real estate or otherwise, we get strategy allocations. We end up the quarter with just under $285 million of cash, assuming some nominal amount of cash held after we take out the convert, if the converts are $180 million. So unless we refinance those that takes you to a $100 million of cash, I'm going to assume you hold some portion about for working capital, as you know, we target mid-teens for the difference.
Bill Sonneborn: And that's a way we're going to regain capital between now and the convert take out date. And some total of that at a mid-teens expected rate of return of which we expect a little over half of it to be cash, like realized current consistent cash and some may either have an accrual in terms of a discount accretion concept, or some other total rate of return component. That's how we think about modeling the business.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: And lastly, what is the strategy, mentioned briefly. But the likelihood of status of the company issuing straight debt, which would benefit the equity holders, is that something that you'll like to become a reality in the next 12 months?
Bill Sonneborn: That's something we mentioned in the last quarter. Strategically, our next capital market transactions we're focused on is, one which we could have term financing at the holding company. Our leverage has continued to decline materially at the holding company to the point where we're 7.3 levered on a recourse basis at the holding company. And so lowering our cost of capital is clearly something that's high in our priority, until we've been very much working on that project. And I think that sometime in the next 6 to 12 months we'd like to achieve something.
Operator: And our last question will come from Joel Montgomery from Cobalt Capital.
Joel Montgomery - Cobalt Capital: Can you elaborate on what generated the $7.4 million income tax expense? Was that entirely related to the $10 million gain you recognized this quarter on Hilcorp?
Bill Sonneborn: No, it wasn't. There was another private equity investment that we held at unrealized gain, so just a mark-to-market unrealized gain percentage (inaudible) as a result of it being a closer entity, which is a PTP. Therefore, we needed to structure it and hold that investment in a C corp locker sub of the company. Corresponding with the write-up of the fair market value, we recorded a differed tax liability, representing corporate tax rate on that unrealized gain that we recorded pursuant to its increase in fair market value.
Michael McFarren: And Joel, that's also, as Bill had mentioned on the call, a non-cash, so this is a temporary difference between GAAP and tax, based on the ultimate disposition of that and the related assets that would impact the tax provision amount and we end up same.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sonneborne for any closing or additional remarks.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you all. We appreciate your continued interest and trust. We'll get back to our working on the next quarter. Have a good evening.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Angela Yang. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Angela Yang: Thank you, operator. And good afternoon, everyone. I’m Angela Yang, Head of Investor Relations for KKR Financial Holdings LLC. And joining me on the call today are Bill Sonneborn, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating and Financial Officer. This afternoon's call is being webcast on our website at www.kkr.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call available as well. Our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011 were issued today. And as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we get started, I would like to caution you that this conference call and webcast contain forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of operations of the company as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website on www.sec.gov. KFN's actual results may vary materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In addition, some of the discussion today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures as well as their corresponding GAAP reconciliations may be found in the supplemental information packet available on our website. The supplemental information packet on our website includes information that we will be referring to on our call today. We encourage you to have this information available during the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Sonneborn.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, Angela. And thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I’ll begin my remarks with some highlights of the quarter followed by an update on the business as we look ahead. For the purpose of this call, we suggest you do refer to the supplemental information packet Angela described, which as she mentioned is available on our website. First, the highlights of the quarter, which were listed on page two of our supplemental presentation. We were able to produce another strong quarter of financial results. We generated $0.51 in earnings per diluted share, representing a 22% return on equity during the quarter. This compares to $0.48 of earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Run rate cash earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.27 per share and total net cash earnings per share was $0.30. The $0.30 cash earnings per share represents a 13% cash yield on equity. Run rate cash earnings per share and total net cash earnings per share are two key non-GAAP metrics that we focus on, as they represent cash that we could either distribute to our shareholders or retain for future growth. Next, on to our book value. As of March 31, our book value per share was $9.73, which represents an increase of $0.49 per share or 5% sequentially from $9.24 as of the end of the year and an increase of $1.42 per share or 17% from a year ago. The increase in book value this quarter primarily reflects retained earnings, appreciation in the market value of our high yield bond position, as well as depreciation in the values of our cash flow interest rate hedges. As contained in the earnings release filed today, on April 27th, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $0.16 per common share. This represents our sixth consecutive quarterly increase of cash distribution to shareholders. The $0.14 difference between our total net cash earnings per share and our distribution per share of $0.16 represent a rough estimate of retained cash that we will reinvest back into our business. Now on to our portfolio, which continues to perform very well. As of March 31th, the weighted average estimated fair value of our corporate debt portfolio was 97% of par value. Compared to the weighted average carrying value, the purpose is of calculating our GAAP book value of 92% of par. In other words, the estimated fair market value of our portfolio at quarter-end was approximately $2.04 higher per share than the $9.73 book value per share we reported. Accordingly, if we were a business development company, or BDC, and carried all of our corporate debt assets at fair value on our balance sheet, our net asset value per share would be $11.77, holding everything else constant. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on the deployment of the $176 million of capital we raised this past December. We are pleased to announce that we have completed the deployment of capital to attractive opportunities that represented desired cross mix of our targeted strategies, approximately two quarters earlier than we anticipated. Our largest transaction in the quarter was the closing of CLO 2011-1 for which we contributed $100 million of equity capital. This transaction represents our first CLO since the credit crisis and represents a transaction where we successfully leveraged our knowledge of CLO technologies with our relationships to privately place $300 million of senior financing at LIBOR plus 135 in an innovative structure. We also deployed $55 million to acquire overriding royalty interest that both developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil acreage located in South Texas that was sourced on a proprietary basis. This investment was a great opportunity to acquire royalty interest in acreage managed by top quality operator that we believe has the potential to generate an attractive IRR over the life of the transaction. During the quarter, we deployed capital to our other strategies, including $40 million to 10 primarily distressed special situations transactions, predominantly in Europe and in Australia; $10.5 million to a mezzanine transaction involving Bain Capital’s acquisition of IMCD, a large chemicals distribution business in Europe; and a $10 million private equity investment in Delmonte that was made alongside KKR’s private equity funds. As we look ahead, we believe there is a healthy pipeline of opportunities. We have agreed to acquire from Carrizo Oil & Gas, a public company, a portion of its Barnett Shale Tier 1 properties for approximately $58 million. KFN purchased working interest in approximately 13,000 acres, containing 75 gross natural gas wells currently producing at an approximate gross rate of 15.7 Mcf per day. We expect this transaction to close by mid-May. This transaction will bring the total net capital we have allocated to our upstream natural resources strategy to approximately $150 million, funding approximately $190 million in assets across natural gas, oils, and natural gas liquids, with the difference being total borrowings related to the strategy after the closing of the acquisition from Carrizo. I point you to slide seven of our supplemental materials, which shows both gross assets and net holding company capital at risk across our business lines. In addition, we have further increased disclosure this quarter, as described on pages eight through ten in the supplemental materials, in order to provide greater transparency of the capital risk, cash earnings, and total expected rates of return across the various strategies we deploy capital. In addition, we are actively evaluating new CLO transactions and are working on new opportunities across our other strategies that we believe will enable us to continue deploy capital while targeting our mid-teen total rate with the majority of such returns and consistent cash earnings that we can share with shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter performance and to provide you with an update on our capital structure as we continue to focus on growth.
Michael McFerran: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon. I’ll begin my remarks with a review of our results for the quarter and then spend just a few minutes talking about our capital structure. As disclosed in today’s filings, on April 27th, our Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share cash distribution for the first quarter of 2011. This represents a $0.01 per share increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a $0.06 per share or 60% increase from the first quarter of 2010. I do want to update you on our cash distribution policy. Our Board of Directors has approved an amendment to our existing policy whereby our Board of Directors will consider declaring a special cash distribution in addition to our recurring quarterly distributions. The determination of whether to declare a special distribution and the amount to declare will be based on our review of various factors, including current market conditions, existing restrictions in our borrowing agreements, the amount of ordinary taxable income or loss we earn, and gains or losses we recognize on the disposition of assets and/or liquidity. We will generally determine gains or losses on dispositions based upon the price the company paid for the assets, which due to the tax rules applicable to partnerships may differ from the gains or losses recognized by a shareholder as the shareholder’s gain or loss of the sale of an asset may be higher or lower depending on the purchase price that the shareholder paid for our shares. We currently expect that our Board of Directors will consider a special distribution on an annual basis after the end of each fiscal year. However, there is no guarantee that a special distribution will be declared after any fiscal year. Next, our financial results for the quarter. We had a good quarter, as witnessed by both balance sheet and income statement performance. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.51, which translates to a 22% return on GAAP equity. Investment income totaled $135.3 million for the quarter, which represents a 13% increase year-over-year, and net interest margin totaled $91.1 million, which represents a 9% year-over-year increase from $83.3 million for the first quarter of 2010. The difference in growth of total investment income and net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in interest expense to affiliates of $7.6 million from $4.5 million for the first quarter of 2010 to $12.1 million for the first quarter of this year. As you may recall, prior to the end of 2010, subordinated notes issued by CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A were not received in full interest payments as the accrued interest on mezzanine notes issued by these CLOs was being repaid. This quarter represents the first full quarter where the accrued interest of subordinated notes was paid to the subordinated note holders. The increase in interest expense to affiliates reflects full distributions on these notes, which weren’t occurring in the corresponding period last year and has no impact on economic value, that is simply a result of our inability to record it as an accounting convention, minority interest for the portions of these two CLOs not held by KFN. During the quarter, we recorded the provision for loan losses of $11.7 million. This provision was recorded to increase the unallocated components of our allowance for loan losses, which relates to our loan portfolio held for investment in an entirety as opposed to relating to specific investments. And as reported, it reflects growth in our portfolio since year-end and remains at 3.4% of our loans held for investment. Our results for the quarter also reflect $46.4 million of other income, which was primarily driven by realized and unrealized gains on our investments totaling $39.2 million, and gains on foreign currency translation of approximately $6 million. As Bill already highlighted, two key non-GAAP metrics that we used to assess our performance on a cash basis are run rate cash earnings per share and total net cash earnings per share. Run rate cash earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.27, and total net cash earnings per share totaled $0.30 for the quarter. Our cash earnings per share metrics both reflect $12.8 million of semi-annual coupon payments on our convertible notes paid during the first quarter. As these paid in January and July, our second quarter cash per share performance will reflect this cash outflow. I refer you to page 18 in our supplemental materials for a reconciliation of GAAP and the detail of the components of these per-share cash calculation. Next, our balance sheet and capital structure. As of March 31, our book value per share was $9.73, which represents an increase of $0.49 per share or 5% from $9.24 per share from year-end and a 17% increase from a year ago. One metric Bill highlighted that bears being repeated is that at quarter-end, related average estimated fair value of our corporate debt portfolio was 97% of par value compared to a weighted average carrying value, which is used for purposes of calculating GAAP book value, of 92% of par. This differential results in $2.04 of fair value per share embedded in our balance sheet above our reported book value. Historical trending of our book value per share and the fair value of our corporate debt portfolio are detailed on pages four and five of our supplemental presentation. We ended the quarter with $129.3 million of unrestricted cash, and similar to last quarter, we have no borrowings outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility. We remain very focused on growing our weighted average cost of capital by evaluating opportunities in the term debt capital markets to capital fund flow. The opportunities that we focused on includes incremental CLO transactions, which represents a form of non-recourse leverage that we like and a deep experience in utilizing. On March 31, we closed CLO 2011-1 through which we contributed $100 million of capital and are able to borrow up to $300 million to finance senior leverage loans at three-month LIBOR plus 135 basis points. This transaction differs from our other CLOs in a couple of ways, including aspects of it being an innovative structure. First, this is a status quo transaction. Accordingly, there is no reinvestment period once the aggregate portfolio is ramped. The attractive feature of this is that’s subject to maintain certain compliance measures in the transaction. As assets are sold or paid down, we receive our pro rata share of principal cash as compared to traditional CLOs, under which should we see the principal back after the senior debt had been repaid. With respect to future transactions, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to leverage CLOs for both growth and to replace our existing transactions as they begin amortizing post reinvestment period. Now I’m going to hand this back to Bill.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, Mike. We are pleased with the positive momentum occurring within our business. On past calls, we have discussed our views on asset allocation, with our focus being long-term growth and shareholder value. We increased cash distributions and growth in enterprise value. I’ll sum up this past quarter as one where we executed on our business model by meaningfully deploying capital to opportunities that leveraged all of the capabilities of KKR. These opportunities were consistent with our core tenants to capital deployment that we discussed on previous calls, which include, first, focusing on growing enterprise value on cash distribution by deploying capital to opportunities that balance capital appreciation with cash flow growth; second, sourcing opportunities that give us options to increase risk-adjusted returns by constructing a portfolio of holdings that will perform well in a higher rate or even inflationary environment; third and finally, leveraging the global KKR team to deploy capital situation where we believe we have a competitive and proprietary advantage. Slide 11 in our supplemental presentation provides an illustration of how our balance sheet capital at risk is deployed today and provides a theoretical example of our potential future allocations as we continue to deploy capital based on our key tenants. The pie chart for KFN today on slide 11 tied to an allocation of net holding company capital at risk provided on the bottom of page seven. As depicted here, corporate debt in its entirety includes CLOs, mezzanine and special situations funded directly has and will continue to be the asset class where we expect to deploy the majority of our capital. But the CLO market remains a key focus for us as a source of interesting risk adjusted returns. As this slide depicts, we intend to continue to diversify our holdings as we execute on our targeted asset class strategy that are shown here and summarized both on pages eight to ten of that supplemental presentation and discussed in more detailed in the executive overview section of management’s discussion and analysis contained in our Form 10-Q that we filed today. As we move forward in 2011, we sit here with a strong balance sheet, characterized by a well-performing portfolio and low leverage. We believe we have an attractive pipeline of opportunities across our business that we are working on. And needless to say, we are excited about where we are going as we work to grow value for our shareholders. We believe KFN is a unique specialty finance company that has tremendous opportunity to continue to deliver shareholder value in proprietary ways. We look forward to continuing to update you on the progress we make on executing on our strategy next quarter. With that, we will open this call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question will come from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is regarding the CLO you announced a few weeks back, is there a formal or informal arrangement with the counterparty in that? And if there is some sort of arrangement where you might have some follow-up activity, would the terms be similar or can it evolve over time?
William Sonneborn: There is not a formal arrangement, John, for future transactions with that investor. However, based on their interest and our interest of doing a similar transaction in the future, it’s definitely possible. As far as future terms will be dictated, a combination of what’s meaningful for us and what makes sense compared to other transactions, we could do more revolving in the market.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. Can you guys discuss maybe over the last three months where you are seeing any changes in risk-adjusted returns? Are there anything that’s getting a little tight relative to where you’d want to invest? And is there types of asset classes where there might be incremental opportunities at this point?
William Sonneborn: That’s a good question, John. I think in the US distress market, we’ve seen very little opportunity both in the context of credit spread compression. And I think that extends into the high yield market in the US, both because of absolute yield as well as credit spreads. But we are seeing opportunity continuously as the tightening of liability spreads faster than that of spreads in the loan side, which is making CLOs attractive for deploying capital. Special situations in Europe and Australia, particularly in Europe, as a result of banks finally starting to deleverage by selling assets in the marketplace. And then finally, we still see in the middle market, interesting mez transactions above and beyond what we are doing in natural resources. But I’d say, generally speaking, the high-yield market in the US, we think, is pretty tight.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. And my final question is, given that Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company’s, your biggest investment, I believe they just went through a restructuring that involved an increase in remuneration for the creditors. Could you just talk about what that – the specifics to that and how that may or may not benefit you?
William Sonneborn: Sure. For those of you who understand from the public filing of what the transaction that Energy Future Holdings’ subsidiary TXU did, they extended their senior secured term loan through an amendment in extension exercise, the result of which, just to simplify, is that holders that did agree to extend under the transaction of which more than 80% of term loan holders did do receive four points effectively of cash upfront is the effective consideration for the extension plus an additional 100 basis point spread in terms of credit spread over the new extended term, extending the term loan from 2014 to 2017.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Is there any GAAP accrual in the near-term on that four points or is that something you just accrue over the life of the loan?
William Sonneborn: The cash comes in right away. GAAP, Michael, I’ll let you answer that question.
Michael McFerran: The cash comes in right away. John, we’ll have to work through the accounting to decide whether or not cash under GAAP should be recognized A-1 or if it should be capitalized part of our base based of the investment, amortized over the remaining life, we will update you on the next quarter. Total amount of cash that came in, primarily two are CLOs, was about $16.5 million.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. Thank you guys very much.
William Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Sarcone with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
William Sonneborn: Hi, Michael, how are you?
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Good, thanks. First question, just on your thoughts about the CLO market, can you give us any color on timing as it relates to current CLOs, which have reinvestment periods ending soon?
William Sonneborn: Sure. We have disclosed in the past 2007-A ended its reinvestment period last October. 2005-1 just ended its reinvestment period in April, some few weeks back. 2005-2 ends its reinvestment period this month, May. 2006-1 will end a year from now in our largest CLO, which represents almost half our total exposure to the market. It’s got reinvestments running at May of 2014. As far as how we think about that, Michael, we’re focused on two items. One, based on our modeling, we think there is still a fair amount of opportunity with the CLOs post reinvestment period. That notwithstanding, we still think at some point between the end of the reinvestment period and ultimately the maturity of the deal will actually want to replace these deals or call them and replace them with another opportunity, we are focused on looking at the market as we evaluate our CLOs and are looking at one new CLO over the long run that was replaced some. Or two, potentially amending our current deals. So we will have more information on that in the quarters to come.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Got it. And then just on G&A, is the $8 million a good run rate going forward?
William Sonneborn: No, I’d say that’s a high number. I would probably assume closer to $5 million is more of a reasonable number prospectively. There were some one-time non-cash write-off that took place this quarter, but that’s just a one-time event.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Okay. And my last question just – can you give us any color on credit, just what you’re seeing in the portfolio?
William Sonneborn: Sure. Generally across the portfolio, credit conditions are benign. You’ve seen that in terms of any default statistics as well as depreciation as the value of the portfolio at much faster rates over the course of the last six quarters and the overall market. Credit spreads have tightened, as we talked about previously, particularly in subordinated capital in the high-yield market much faster than the loan market, predominantly because loans are floating rate instruments priced up the short end of the curve. And so their absolute levels of cash yield are less to investors than high yield because there continues to be a lot of liquidity in the system as a result of Q2 and a search particularly amongst retail investors’ group sources of yield. But in terms of our overall portfolio, I think you would see, comparing and contrasting our largest 50 positions contained within the supplemental materials, continued diversification of that portfolio from some of the large concentrated positions. When you go through that list, the number of items that an average person should be worried about continues to dwindle in terms of size and scale.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Kwok with KBW.
Steven Kwok – KBW: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering first on credit, I was – I noticed that there was a loan loss provision of about $12 million and charge-offs of $22 million during the quarter. I was wondering if you guys could talk about that.
William Sonneborn: Sure. Mike can talk a little bit about the charge-offs, but that’s just a balance sheet movement from held for investment in which hold loans at basically cost less the allowance and then move them to lower cost to market. But in the case of provision, especially we saw this quarter is just to an unallocated, we’ll call it, for potential rainy day sources since there’s no specific credits in mind, a consistent approach both top-down of the 3.4% of our loans held for investment held within the allowance. Mike, do you want to talk a little about the classification between held for investment and available for sale?
Michael McFerran: Yes. Steven, the charge-offs took place this quarter were all transferring loans to held for sale where they carry lower cost to market. This is simply a balance sheet convention. It doesn’t change the carrying value of the portfolio. No change to value. None of the charge-offs actually related to credit loss, rather just movements to be held for sale. You will see those periodically. I would view that number being pretty separate and apart from the 11 million of provision according to Bill’s point. But again we’ll just increase our overall provision of our unallocated reserve, but again, not relating to any specific credits.
William Sonneborn: A good example is a LIBOR plus 200 loan with no four that was done in first quarter of 2007. It’s still market today. Even though company has performed well, it’s going to be 96. And so if you move that loan to available for sale, you take the four points of the loan balance as a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses.
Steven Kwok – KBW: Great. And any forward commentary on future provisions for losses or –? I’m just wondering, is it’s been – this is the third consecutive month where you guys have had provisions. Just curious what the trajectory is.
William Sonneborn: No, if we think – we've held the allowance constant for the last several quarters at 3.4%. The amortized cost basis of our loans held for investment portfolio. We think that’s a prudent and conservative reserve based on the class win. If we look at how loans are performing, our portfolio in particular, we have no looming credit events that have us concerned. But as the portfolio continues to grow, we think it’s prudent to increase our allowance accordingly.
Michael McFerran: One of the reasons for that is that we’ve been taking advantage of opportunities in distress in Europe and in Australia as an example. We buy a loan of a company we expect to go through restructuring even though we are using traditional loan accounting and having that loan as held for investment. And the underlying loan has very attractive return parameters. Maintaining a reasonable allowance against that portion of our balance sheet makes sense as well.
Steven Kwok – KBW: Great. And final question, with regard to the net discount accretion, I noticed that it ticked down a little bit this quarter, but still higher than the typical average run rate of, say, $20 million to $25 million. Just wondering, are there any one-timers in that line?
William Sonneborn: Every quarter, Steven, we have – the way we report the loans prepay is the difference of that accelerated accretion goes and the discount accretion line. So that number is going to have some volatility as a function of just the level of prepayments we’ve experienced. To your point, fourth quarter of 2010, we had a higher level of prepayments of loans, credit discounts that we have this quarter. But I believe about $5 million of that number this quarter was related to prepayments.
Steven Kwok – KBW: Okay. Great. Thanks.
William Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now hear from Gabe Poggi with FBR.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
William Sonneborn: Hi, Gabe, how are you?
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Good. How are you, guys? A few questions, kind of more macro questions. Bill and Mike, you guys have said now for seem like nine months or so as the CLO market has headed back up and folks would ask questions that you were kind of waiting for the market to come to you. You guys obviously did a CLO in the first quarter. But that was a unique transaction that was smaller with static. Is it safe to say that with other transactions pricing in the market that have higher leverage continue to squeeze on cost of funds at the market, continues to kind of come your way and you guys are now seeing more avenues to potentially do something, and I don’t necessarily want to say bigger, but more leverage, things of that nature?
William Sonneborn: We’ve seen, Gabe, definitely to your point, an increase in activity in the CLO market. There is a broader investor base and there was even as recently as late last year. So with that, there are increasingly more opportunities. The key thing to keep in mind is we think about it as we use CLOs as financing. So we may have a different view on how much leverage we want to put on a transaction. Others are issued in for different reasons. But 2011-1 was a good example to your point of a transaction coming to us. We are focused on when the economics makes sense, we’d like to do these deals. If it’s a private transaction like 2011-1 that makes the most sense and meets our risk adjusted return, we’ll do it. If it’s a traditional market transaction, we’ll do that. We’re fairly agnostic between the two.
Michael McFerran: But as an example, Gabe, the CLO market was in the senior part of the liability side, more in the 140, 150 over range. And so we did this transaction. And then we brought the overall senior as a result of printing this transaction, new deals that are being marketed. Now we’re at the same pricing this one was done at. And so strategically, we’re protecting our downside of future credit compression through this privately negotiated transactions that we are going to principal out faster than you would in a traditional CLO. At the same time, we brought the overall liability cost down for the industry. On top of that, which is kind of interesting from our perspective, is there is a new rule being proposed, which is the skin in the game rule, which could have substantial limit on the supply of CLOs in the marketplace other than potentially for providers of the structure sets of KFN, which makes us interestingly positioned to take advantage of more demand. And there is supply in terms of product available. Sometime over the summer when and if that rule becomes effective.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: You answered my second question which was going to be that. And I assumed and obviously that’s a very good thing for KFN if in fact that does move down the line. Bill, you talked about kind of in terms of asset classes where you’re seeing commissioning opportunities, you mentioned Europe, is that specifically in bank debt you guys have kind of in the forward pie chart? I’m just kind of thinking out of the box here, but do you have commercial real estate in there? Are you – have you guys – has KFN in aggregate begun to look more aggressively at commercial real estate opportunities? Is that still kind of low on the totem pole relative to natural resources and kind of the CLO gain?
William Sonneborn: It’s a great question, Gabe. But it’s something we are actually spending a lot of time now, because the opportunity is pretty right particularly in European commercial banks that have statutory agreed dates and asset disposition targets with their respective regulators or in some cases, majority owners. In the case of the European marketplace, it’s also that there is about $1 trillion of assets, predominantly commercial real estate debt-related, some performing, a lot non-performing that is likely going to be disposed over the course of the next four to six quarters. And we have had a team spending a tremendous amount of time in Europe meeting with these respective financial institutions to try to take advantage of what we think is an interesting opportunity. The opportunity has been there now for two years. It’s just there has been no paper to purchase. And what’s interesting now is that the supply could be enormous. And so, yes, we are preparing for an interesting opportunity in commercial real estate.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Interesting. Okay, that’s helpful. And then one last kind of nuts-and-bolts question. Mike, you may have said this and I may have missed it. Any specifics on the delta between 4Q investment income and 1Q investment income as it pertains on the loan side of things? I know that your securities book is continuing to run down as you guys think high yield tight, but just the delta between 115, call it, million in loan interest income relative to call it 110, rounding up? Any specifics or just the portfolio day-to-day?
Michael McFerran: No, the specifics are having really to do with – if you look at total interest income on loans, we talked earlier about discount accretion and prepayments. That’s probably the biggest piece of it. The second of it, to some extent, Gabe, is the timing of when we divested assets and repurchased assets. So sometimes in any given quarter you could see some lumpiness as we had a fair amount of pay-downs at the end of Q4 and that capital wasn’t necessarily deployed at the first day of this quarter.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, guys. Good quarter.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, Gabe.
Operator: And Jasper Burch with Macquarie has the next question.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon. I guess just starting off, staying on the CLO topics, looking at your new CLO and the $159 million of bank loans on your balance sheet, have you or are you selling any of those assets into the new CLO or is it going to be all new purchases and originations?
William Sonneborn: If you look in the supplemental presentation, I know it’s a footnote, Jasper, but we mentioned we have the $159 million. Footnote 1 of that at the bottom of page eight specifies about $159 million. $59 million of it is going into 2011-1, and the rest of it was being purchased outside of our balance sheet. Pro forma after 2011-1, we had about $100 million of loans on balance sheet held for future CLO deals.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Okay. And then could you provide what you guys internally expect to be a loss adjusted ROE on that deal?
William Sonneborn: We targeted mid-teens for CLO transactions, and this deal is consistent with that.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Okay. Excellent. And then moving on to the 2005 CLOs, I think it was April, May reinvestment periods ending. I think if you recall earlier, I was just wondering – could you give us a little more color so I can try and model out how those are going to be ramping down, specifically like the weighted average life on those and there was the prepayment rates you’ve seeing?
William Sonneborn: I think the easiest way, Jasper, to think about that is how Mike and I think about that is, as those start to effectively de-lever and pay down senior notes, at the point where the kind of IRRs or return on equity capital that we have get to mid-teens, at that point we will call and refinance into a new transaction to at least maintain mid-teens rate to return. So when I think about the business, I assume that as returns go from, say, 22%, because of the low cost liability, down to, say, 15%, then I’m going to redeploy that capital at 15% I perpetuity. That’s always how I think about it.
Michael McFerran: When we – Jasper, for the last couple years we were talking about we were redeploying pay-down each assets that are on average at higher yield than what we’ve initially put in the CLOs. And we’ve been benefiting from that the ROEs on those deals in the 20s now. To Bill’s point, we’re going to see that come down and then we’re going to cut it off and cut in new deals somewhere in that north of mid-teens or north of their returns. But this is – what you’re speaking of the high ROE is definitely a result of deploying capital over the last couple of years.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Okay. Thank you. That’s very helpful. And then I guess just lastly, real quick, of the $590 million of restricted cash at quarter-end, how much of that is still available to be invested within the remaining CLOs?
William Sonneborn: The majority of that is cash that’s available. That being said, that number fluctuates as you can appreciate any given day based on step-up prepayment failed, unsafe settlements of traits, that’s not necessarily a number that – you're going to find a big pay-down the day before, we could have had a tray that just hadn’t settled first.
Michael McFerran: Yes. The way to think about it is a large portion of that any one quarter-end has already been traded. It’s just in the loan market. It can take a couple weeks to settle the trade. And so it will still show up as restricted cash until the settlement date.
William Sonneborn: Yes.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Okay. Just think about the available cash that you still have to turn over to the balance sheet, I guess we should look at just 512-5 [ph] just the best, how you guys looking at it internally?
William Sonneborn: Yes. The way I would start with, we said unrestricted cash was $129 million. We have assets on balance sheet remains to be highlighted at $100 million. There are other assets outside of the $100 million targeted for CLOs that we could – that are fairly liquid that we could choose to divest the credit section in our balance sheet.
Michael McFerran: Where you see a fair amount of assets and from a liquidity standpoint, we also have the revolver we can always look to, which we haven’t used it quite some time, but that gives us flexibility. But as we mentioned, we think we have enough liquidity and access to our balance sheet to our borrowing facility to be able to continue to execute on the strategy without feeling constrained today.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Okay. Thank you, guys, very much.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, Jasper.
Jasper Burch – Macquarie: Our next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Yes, thank you. I just want to make sure I definitely understand everything I should understand. We have taxable income, we have total cash earnings, we have run rate cash earnings. So, the dividend policy of the corporation is set off of on the recurring quarterly earnings? As I read the footnote disclosure, the modified footnote disclosure in the current Q, basically that the distribution quarterly most likely is measured off the run rate of cash earnings. Is that a fair statement?
William Sonneborn: Yes, that’s a fair statement. But when we determine that, we’re not only looking at that current quarter, but we’re also, as we have talked about in previous quarters, making a risk analysis because it is the management and the Board’s desire to never have to reduce that number in the future.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Yes. (inaudible) because the dividend of $0.16 is 59% of the run rate cash earnings.
William Sonneborn: That’s correct.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: What is the total taxable earnings in the quarter?
William Sonneborn: We don’t have the taxable earnings (inaudible) nor we disclose that for the quarter.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Is that quite confidential?
William Sonneborn: No, it’s not confidential. I got to go back to every shareholder as we talked about at the different basis. So we’ve been hesitant to try and take guesses of what our shareholders (inaudible) original tax –
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Let me – I got three or four quick – yes.
William Sonneborn: However, Lee, for purposes of, I would say, directionally, run rate cash earnings should be or recurring taxable income, the best approximate or what I would direct the investors to.
Michael McFerran: Though we did have a substantial tax deduction in the first quarter, which has resulted restricted stock that was granted in first quarter of 2008 vesting, there was a substantial tax deduction that offset a large portion of the $0.30 for tax purposes. It really doesn’t affect GAAP.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Secondly, you got a lot of money, and in December when you did your offering and you put that to work over a 60-day period. I know the nature of your business. You guys know your earnings on a daily basis, less than forthcoming at times. But with the earnings at the end of the quarter, on a monthly basis, running high to the average earnings of the quarter? In other words – just the way question was phrased. In other words, as you got this money to work at higher rates of return, then the earning near zero in cash, did the earnings ramp up over the quarter so that the month of March run rate cash earnings was higher than the month of January?
William Sonneborn: The answer to that is yes. And as you see, though the CLO 2011-1, which is the largest portion of the capital redeployment didn’t close until the end of the quarter and we just closed the ramp-up nature of that on its closed date as well as more recently. And as a result of that, you won’t see the full run rate effect. And you see the majority of the run rate effect into the second quarter and then full impact in the third quarter.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Got you. In terms of capital for growth, we have this unrestricted cash of $129 million, we have zero borrowings on your revolver, and you mentioned on the last call and this call the term debt capital market. I have felt all along that we got to be very careful the way we sell new equity. I look at the book value, not the $9.73 number. I look at my book value, the $11.77 number. And I was curious you guys have any view of the need for additional equity or is that not in near-term time horizon. And you agree that you should be looking at the $11.77 number today as opposed to $9.73 number for any potential raise-up.
William Sonneborn: You raised an interesting question, because if I look at kind of other specified finance comps like GDP is 21.2 times book value, which is the equivalent of the $11.77 number. And then I compare that to where we trade relative to our GAAP book value, which is a discount to that number substantially. I find it kind of interesting and somewhat disturbing, to be honest with you. But the answer is, as we’ve talked about in previous quarters and when we raised the equity in the fourth quarter, the amount that we raised was all conditioned upon executing strategy we had to show the market that there is growth outside of the CLO market while we are waiting for it to become more attractive and at mid-teens rates of returns that we have stated we need to deliver to our shareholders as a use of capital. And we know that our equity is highly expensive as a result of what ROE we’re producing and can produce going forward. And so we’re very sensitive to raising equity that’s dilutive to our shareholders.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: So, is that one way of responding to the question that we have enough debt capacity and we’re cognizant to the real value of the business and we’re not likely to sell equity?
William Sonneborn: We talked about last quarterly that we want to lower our cost of capital. And the one way to do that is outside of the CLO market, have enough diversification where theoretically we can raise low coupon investment grade debt as a means of additional growth, which is highly accretive to our ability to maintain and generate attractive returns to our shareholders in the future.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: One other suggestion. I find very – not enough people know about you. It’s just a handle of us. Maybe you get on the road and tell the story a little bit.
William Sonneborn: Aye-aye, sir.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: You get some mileage, you know, mileage plus or some mileage called these days. Thank you very much.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, Lee.
Operator: We’ll take the next question from Wayne Cooperman with Cobalt Capital.
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about TXU or whatever you call these days? Has this restructuring gone through? What is your position now? Are your economic – I would think if I went through, your economics are actually relatively materially improved than they were before. Just give us a little color on your current situation.
William Sonneborn: Sure. If you have the supplemental materials, look on slide we’ve put up for you in slide 15, you’ll see our largest position with TXU, which is the Energy Future Holdings complex, which is the holding company. I think in our footnote disclosure in our financial statements, we added some stuff in terms of concentration of credit risk. Mike mentioned that the four points of upfront fee as a result and little over $12 million of – $15 million of cash that we’ll receive this quarter. Our position, as we’ve talked about in previous quarterly calls, is almost exclusively in the senior secured term loan. And so in addition to the four points and $16 million of net cash we will receive as a result of the amendment and extension in the second quarter of this year, we’ll also get an extra 100 basis points of credit spread on that same 400 million of exposure.
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: And what’s the line of the maturity now?
William Sonneborn: 2017, with a spring maturity that ties to the bond part of the capital structure to the extent the bonds aren’t refinanced.
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: Do you think – I mean, are you guys any worse off from a credit standpoint than you were before?
William Sonneborn: We don’t believe so. So we wouldn’t have agreed to amend and extend. We think this is beneficial.
Wayne Cooperman – Cobalt Capital: Okay. Thanks.
William Sonneborn: You bet.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that’s all the time we have for questions today. I’ll hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.
William Sonneborn: Thank you, all. We appreciate your interest in following the company and look forward to continue to execute on the company’s strategy. Have a good evening.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Executives:

Analysts: Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets Michael Sarcone - Sandler O’Neill Kyle Joseph - JMP Securities Matthew Howlett – Macquarie Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC third 2010 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Laurie Poggi. Please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Thank you, Elizabeth and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on the call today Bill Sonneborn, our Chief Executive Officer and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Financial Officer. As a reminder this call is being recorded and webcast live on our website. Today, we issued our financial results released for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and filed our third quarter Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, together with the supplemental information packet are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.kkr.com. Be for we get started, I’d like to caution you that this conference call and webcast contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions.  These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the SEC. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. KFN’s actual results may vary materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. In addition some of the discussion today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures may be found in the supplemental information packet also available on our website. With that I’ll turn the call over to, Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Laurie, and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. We appreciate your time and interest in KFN. We had a solid quarter based on the metrics we focus on. We fortunately were able to increase our earnings, book value, cash flow and distributions per share and we identified the unique opportunities for deploying our retained earnings and attractive target returns. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.52 per common share, which compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of this year, and $0.42 for the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, we generated a 25% return on equity in the quarter. If you subtract the impact of realized gains and other less predictable sources of revenue, as well as share-based compensation and incentive fee expense, we generated run rate earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter or a pro forma 20% run rate return on equity. Run rate income is a non-GAAP financial measure and it is a key metric that we use to evaluate the recurring earnings power of our business. Share-based compensation expenses excluded, this is a non-cash charge and incentive fee expenses excluded this amount is generally driven by realized gains at our portfolio that are included in our other income line in our income statement.  Run rate income for the quarter of $0.43 compares to $0.39 for the third quarter of last year. As disclosed in our earnings release yesterday our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $0.14 per common share payable on December 1 to shareholders is a record on November 17. This represents a 17% increase from our $0.12 per share dividend for the second quarter and following this payment, we would have distributed $0.36 per share for the first three quarters of this year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where we have increased distributions per share. With respect to cash flow, as shown on page 11 of our supplemental materials as new disclosure that we think is useful to investors on a going forward basis. Run rate, cash earnings per share equaled $0.27 for the third quarter as compared to $0.20 for the second quarter. Run rate cash earnings for the quarter represent effectively a 13% cash conversion with return on equity and can be used for either distributions to our shareholders or reinvestments into our business.  This number does fluctuate due to the timing of interest payments on our convertible notes, which are paid semiannually in July and January, so we had a payment this quarter, and the timing of receipts of interest payments and certain bond and loan position that have semiannually payment frequencies. This metric simply represents cash income excluding one-time items included in another income, net of all cash expense, effectively excludes principle accretion, quick interest or gains on any of our private equity investments. For the first three quarters of 2010, our run rate cash earnings per share totaled $0.61 or an average of $0.20 quarterly per share this year. For the same nine month period, we declared aggregate dividends of $0.36 per share retaining $0.25 per reinvestment in our growth. A 25% ROE, a 20% run rate ROE, and a 13% cash conversion ROE, these are three of the key metrics we focus on and feel fortunate to be able to generate for shareholders such returns in a 2.5% “risk free environment”. Book value per share at quarter end was $8.60 as compared to $8.08 as of June 30. The increase in book value for this quarter primary reflects earnings growth and appreciation in the market value of our high yield bond position partially offset by decline in the values of our interest rate hedges, which are primary held in our CLOs. Now on to our portfolio which continues to perform well. As of quarter end both the carrying value and market value of our corporate debt holdings as reflected in our book value of $8.60 per common share totaled 7.3 billion, which is 92% of par value of 8 billion. This is an improvement from June 30 where the weighted average market value of our corporate debt portfolio was 89% of par. At quarter end the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our portfolio equates to $4.30 per share. During the quarter, we did book an additional provision for loan losses of 8.1 million predominantly offsetting charge-offs taken during the quarter from loans we move from held to investment to held for sale. As we have discussed in past calls we deploy capital base on our strategic capital allocation methodology, which reflects our three core tenants to deploying capital. First, we will only deploy capital to opportunities where KKR has the competitive advantage through its global investment team sourcing and relationships. Second, we are focused on constructing a portfolio that is balanced between holdings that generate solid recurring cash flows for distributions to our shareholders and those that present opportunities for a long-term capital appreciation. And finally and third, our goal is to construct a portfolio that performs well across the economic cycles and preserves our ability to maintain a dividend and an attractive premium to the risk-free rate across different rate environment. Since our last quarter’s earnings call, we have deployed or committed to deploy or retain capital of approximately 100 million to assets across various strategies including the following. First, with the natural resources; we made our first oil and gas investment purchasing approximately 40 million of assets in conventional producing oil and gas properties with high cash and cash returns, and multifactor embedded option value with respect to underlying commodity price, technology enhancement and additional reserve development.  One of these transactions is already closed, with the second expected to close prior to year end. In addition to these first investments in this strategy we are actively pursuing a significant pipeline of good opportunities. Next, we are participating in the Mezzanine debt being issued by RBS WorldPay as part of the acquisition of RBS WorldPay by Advent International and Bain Capital Partners. In addition to these transactions, we have also deployed capital to several private equity opportunities, including a unique proprietary opportunity to invest in an Indian Power business, sourced by our mangers team in Mumbai. All of these investments have targeted returns between 15% and 25%.  The transactions we are participating and follow our core tendency to deploying capital, that we have consistently discussed with you, and demonstrate the unique capability and breadth of our franchise to source transaction opportunities that are not generally available to others. In addition to KFN being a beneficiary of the global skillsets of the KKR organization, KFN also benefits from our world class credit investment team that’s focused on managing KFN’s leveraged loans and high yield bond holding, that are primarily contained in our CLOs With respect to the CLOs, we continue to actively monitor the CLO new issuance market and continue to evaluate opportunities for a possible future transaction. Each of these capital deployment initiatives relates to our focus on growing cash flow per share, book value per share and distributions per share. While we consider frequently the vagaries of day-to-day markets, including the tug-of-war between the fundamentals in European and U.S. economics and the flood of liquidity looking for yields and in an zero rate environment, we are focused even more in creating long-term shareholder, value through investing behind large and sustained supply demand and balances with proprietary views and ideas. Now I’m going to hand this over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail.
Mike McFerran: Thanks Bill and good afternoon everyone. Net income for the quarter was $82.3 million or $0.52 per diluted common share, this compares to net income of $81 million or $0.51 per diluted common share for the second quarter of this year and $67.2 million or $0.42 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2009. As Bill already described, run rate income per share, a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net investment income plus non-investment expenses excluding the impact of share based compensation and incentive fee expense was $0.43 for the third quarter. This compares to the $0.42 per share for the second quarter and $0.39 for the third quarter of 2009. The $0.43 of run rate income to the quarter equates to a 20% return-on-equity. Our earnings for the quarter benefited from an increase in net investment income to $78.3 million for the third quarter from $76.8 million from the second quarter. The quarterly increase in net investment income was driven by an increase in net interest spread of our corporate debt holdings of over 50 basis points as compared to last quarter end. The increase in net interest spread is primarily attributable to our [inaudible] bond holdings in our CLOs for which the weighted average spreads of LIBOR of these holdings increased approximately 20 basis points.  In addition, the percentage of our portfolio now of LIBOR floors [ph] came in at 21%, an increase of 300 basis points from 18% as of June 30. Other income for the quarter totaled $26.6 million of which $21.9 million was from realized gains from sales of certain loan and bond position. Next our liquidity; as of September 30 we reported unrestricted cash of $97 million. In addition as of quarter end, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility and had approximately $750 million estimated fair value of holdings outside of our CLOs.  Of the $750 million fair values holding outside of our CLOs approximately $500 million are comparatively liquid investment that could be converted to cash. Accordingly with our existing cash, availability under our credit facility and unlevered assets on our balance sheet, we still have considerable dry powder to pursue future opportunities. Next, we’ll update on our CLOs. Based on the trustee reports for our CLOs as of September all of our CLOs currently have overcollateralization levels, above the overcollateralization level amounts for each of our CLOs at the time they were issued respectively. Based on this, we are comfortable that our CLOs will continue to be cash flow generative to us. I do want to highlight that one of our CLOs, 2007-A ended its reinvestment period during October. This means that we are no longer able to reinvest principle proceeds in this transaction. We expect the amortizations of this transaction to take several years and believe that CLO 2007-A will continue to generate attractive cash flows to us for the next several years. As for our capital structure; we are operating with comparatively low recourse leverage for our specialty finance firm and currently have no mark-to-market financing exposure. The low leverage level we are currently maintaining provides us with the ability to add leverage, if and when desire to further increase the earnings on our deployed equity. The last topic I want to cover is cash flows. As Bill highlighted we generated $42.5 million of run rate cash earnings this quarter, which equates to $0.27 per share. Our run rate cash inflows for the quarter totaled $76.3 million of which $55.4 million was generated by our CLOs. Our run rate cash outflows for the quarter consist of $17 million of debt service payments, and $16.8 million of non-investment expenses.  I do want to highlight that our cash outflows include approximately $12.9 million of interest payments on our convertible notes, which are made semiannually. The $0.27 per share of run rate cash earnings represents a 13% cash flow return on equity for the quarter. With that, I’m going to hand this back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Mike. Before opening this call up to Q-&-A, I’d like to conclude by reiterating some of the key takeaways for the quarter. We are generating attractive returns to our shareholders in both in income and cash flow basis with the run rate ROE of 20% for the quarter and a net cash flow conversion ROE of 13%. These returns are being generated with the lowest level of holding company leverage we have had since our IPO. We continue to drive net interest margin and in turn earnings and cash flow by redeploying capital at higher yields to new opportunities. The third quarter is the fourth consecutive quarter of increases in net interest margin of the holdings in our CLOs. In the third quarter alone, we were able to generate a 15% sequential quarterly increase and net interest margin based upon our entire credit portfolio. We have embedded value in our corporate debt portfolio, carrying value 92% of par, roughly the same as it was back in March, which equates to a discount at par of our portfolio $4.30 per share. We have dry powder for deployment in new opportunities including additional investments that tie into our energy thesis and additional CLOs as market returns become more conducive. And as you have heard us discuss before, we are asset sensitive to changes in rates and as a result we effectively embed a free option on short-term LIBOR rising in the future. Finally; Mike and I, as well as all our colleagues at KKR manage KFN with a mindset that this is a marathon and not a spread. Our objective is to maximize the long-term shareholder value by deploying capital and manner the balances opportunities for capital appreciation with opportunities that generate attractive cash flow yield with supported distribution or dividend level that we believe can be maintained at an attractive premium to the treasury rate whatever that may be. Even during a much higher inflationary period, if one comes to past which we think the risk is elevated  KFN is managed by our entire global firm which provides us with the unparalleled ability to source new opportunities across asset classes and around the globe. From private equity co-investment opportunity such as Pets at Home and Hilcorp Resources to proprietary overseas transaction such as RBS WorldPay and an Indian Power business, to opportunities such as working interest and conventional oil and gas properties, and distressed debt transactions. We are complementing KFN’s leverage loan in high yield bond portfolio with diverse and attractive opportunities. Thank you again for joining our call today and your continued support. Operator, can you please open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gabe Poggi with FBR Capital Markets.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital:  Hi good afternoon everyone.
Michael McFerran:  Hi, Gabe.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital:  Thanks for the incremental disclosures in the supplemental, that’s helpful regarding cash earnings and run rates et cetera. Bill and Mike my question is really macro oriented, what are your general thoughts on credit today and then kind of as it pertains to what you guys own currently, where you guys seeing, are there any areas you are seeing more pockets of value than other. Just wanted to get a sense of, it’s November 4, where we are heading to end the year and what’s your defensive - I assume it’s a defensive take is kind of lay the land?
Michael McFerran:  Thanks. Yes sure its want kind of macro, I mean, I think the technical backdrop for credit is continued to be quite strong in that further liquidity through Q2 and the reaction in the markets over the last 24 hours continues to be very proto-cyclical in terms of bullish for credit and credit spreads.  That being said, we tend to be thoughtful in terms of the thinking defensively from a contrarianism point of view, and there are elements within credit markets which we are starting to back away from because of perception of risk versus return. We are finding opportunities in unique areas and so situations like some of the Mezz investments that we’ve made, some of the special situations investments we’ve made outside the U.S. are offering better sources of value, than we see more traditionally in high yields in the U.S.  We still believe within leverage loan that spreads are very attractive. Overall, spreads and LIBOR for us really has not changed despite the rally in credit over the course of the past several months and so we continue to be quite bullish in the loan side of the credit space, less bullish within high yield.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital:  That’s helpful. Just generally, say how many pitches are you guys seeing to hit, so to speak in those new asset. You mentioned the oil and gas, the Mezz. There are lot of pitches out there and you guys are obviously culming through what you’d like to hit?
Michael McFerran:  Our hit rate is very low because of our standards being high, so we can look at hundreds of opportunities to find one. One that we think offers the best risk adjusted returns, but fortunately we are getting access to many, many opportunities to pick and choose from.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital:  Great. Thanks. Good quarter guys.
Michael McFerran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sarcone with Sandler O’Neill & Partners.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O’Neill:  Hi, guys.
Michael McFerran:  Hi, Michael.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O’Neill:  Can you just talk about asset quality and what you are seeing as it relates to this quarter’s provision and how to think about it going forward?
Michael McFerran:  Sure. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter, Michael we’ve kept the allowance flat as, Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks. We booked a small provision that cut the allowance where it was beginning of the quarter, we set the carrying value of the portfolio is on top of the market value, so people can do their own math with what they think, they think the ultimate recovery value is, somewhere between $0 and $4.30 per share from where we are today, but we feel pretty good about how that the balance sheet’s positioned at the moment.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. And then could you just also give us some color on, what kind of yields you are seeing on new leverage loan purchases?
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure, new leverage loans typically have 450 to 500 basis point of credit spread and a general LIBOR 4 of one and three quarters.
Michael Sarcone - Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. Thanks guys and congrats. Mike on the new position.
Michael McFerran:  Thanks Michael.
Operator:  Our next question comes from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
Kyle Joseph - JMP Securities:  Hi guys it’s actually Kyle Joseph in place of John this afternoon. So, a few quick questions for you guys. Congrats first on the quarter.
Michael McFerran:  Thank you.
Kyle Joseph - JMP Securities: Can you give us your perspective on the LBO and the privatization market right now?
Michael McFerran:  Certainly, with the recovery in the high yield markets in particular, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in private equity within LBO’s both within the U.S. and Europe as we speak. Transaction size is increasing, it wouldn’t surprise me to see transactions with $5 million to $10 billion of total consideration potentially in the next few months or quarters.  And with the amount of dry power in the side line within the private equity industry generally, including our colleagues here at KKR, in a view of equity values being relatively attractive from a multiple and cash flow perspective, we’ve now achieved some reasonably well position from a conservative perspective. We expect the continuous trend we are seeing in buyout activity to actually stay at alleviated levels over the next, at least couple of quarters.
Kyle Joseph - JMP Securities:  Okay. Great, thanks and then just one more for you guys. It looks like you had a small up-tick in loans and default status, I was wondering if that has any effect on the provision or if you could give us a little color on what went on there?
Michael McFerran:  No, it was too smaller holdings; we got into a default status. One thing to keep in mind is, one is that both are really small positions we had in our portfolio. Two not necessarily a bad thing it depends on the respective assets, but often we view, when something goes in default there is an opportunity for us, as we go through restructuring, you usually expect it to come out at other end the more attractive piece of paper and quite possibly some equity upside.
Bill Sonneborn:  One thing you have to realize when you looked at statistics is, we allocate capital to distress, in the special situation’s investments where it’s our goal to take it through default and restructuring. And so you have to keep in mind whether it was a situation purchase at par that’s going into default with potential loss or something, but a substantial discounts at par with the goal of equitation.
Kyle Joseph - JMP Securities:  Thanks a lot for answering my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Howlett with Macquarie.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Hi guys and thanks for taking my question. Just on the CLOs 2007-A, you don’t see it in the three [ph] investment period. How do we look at, is anything affecting the cash flow, how do we look at sort of the dollar amount of cash flow that will come out of that as the bond, the deal prepay. I mean so what rate we can assume, what can you do, I mean can you still sell stuff if you wanted to and sort of what would be the rate in which that cash will decline over the next few years of that rundown? 
Bill Sonneborn:  The rate of cash flow decline really depends upon a bunch of activities that can happen going forward. We have the right to sell anything at any time, the proceeds to which of any sales we do would be is to pass the senior financing which then effectively would speed up the amortization if you will, within the transaction and lower future cash flows in that date to any pay downs that can come.  The early pay down effectively results in an accelerated amortization. But based up on the underlying portfolio how we position that portfolio, we don’t expect the downward trend effectively in cash flow out of that transaction to really have any material impact for a while, probably starting a year from now before you start to see any material aspects of cash flow as a result of amortization.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Yes that is true.
Michael McFerran:  And Matt, one other things to add Bill’s comment is as you see amend and extend activity continue, which won’t be a surprise for us. You actually, now offset some of the principal pay down because we are seen more of the existing asset portfolio having LIBOR4 for us, but potentially from higher spreads.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Got you. So, I mean we’ve just been hearing that prepay activity is high and things could come down really quickly. You structured in a way, you’ve built in a way where there is not really near term maturities and there is not guys looking to refinance out of that, is that safe to say, as it’s sort of going to drag along.
Bill Sonneborn:  Yeah, we try to position the transaction, so it have the greatest net present value adding into the end of the three investment period for those very reasons. For the first time though, I think you bring up a good point, which is going forward over into quarter we have had this period of mid to high teens sequential growth in net interest margin across our CLOs and this will be one of the CLOs, it’s virtually a small CLO that will no longer be able other than through amend and extend as Mike suggests, to continue to increase its net interest spread.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Right. It’s fair enough thanks to you guys. And the same with the 0501, I mean that’s – that could enter its reinvestment period about next year at some point of the time. Can we just assume the same type of structure in terms of so you’re running of slower and…
Michael McFerran:  That’s correct.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Okay, good. And then just switching to the new issue market, I mean you talked about kind of like you are looking, also you’re looking into that we’ve heard the pipeline is anywhere between 5 billion and 10 billion, what type of market reaction you’re getting, where could you, where could sort of the indicative price levels coming at, could you even issue one, what are the agencies saying, what about the new financial reform? I know that there are lot of what if. What can you tell us about accessing of this new CLO market?
Michael McFerran:  Sure, I mean I think one of the challenges of the CLO market, securitization market is actually an advantage for us, because we do have a desire to hold all of the subordinated charges and have a material economic interests, which is one of the issues that the Regulatory Act is trying to pursue effectively incentive wise.  Right now there’s six yields in the market today. The pricing of structure leverage levels, flexibility around reimbursement period and call continue to improve. I think our goal is to see the market receptivity on a number of these transactions, we’ve been actively engaged in considering and thinking about those terms and structuring, and working with the street and potential investors, but our goal is to try to bring the best economic deal for our shareholders not the first.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  So the execution is it’s just not there yet, AAA’s aren’t tied enough to make the deal work or the levels, or it’s just not low enough that....
Michael McFerran:  It works but our goal is really focusing on the right returns to our shareholders at KFN and our belief is that the returns are going to be better after some of these transactions get done and...
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Okay. Got you. So more of a 2011 event?
Michael McFerran:  Potentially, yes.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Okay. And then just on the facility, any plans to draw that down, for some of your sort of specialty investments or possibly will have some loans before doing the CLO. Any plans to start on that facility?
Michael McFerran:  We already have a reasonably large, warehouse pool of loans on our balance sheet for CLO, we would draw on the credit facility opportunistically based upon investor opportunities we see to maximize the alignment of our capital structure in the return profile generally investments.
Matthew Howlett – Macquarie:  Great. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.
Michael McFerran:  Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now hear from Leo Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  Thank you very much. First let me congratulate all of those who have been promoted. Nice to see and hope everything goes well for you.
Michael McFerran:  Thank you, Lee.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  You’re welcome. I have a half dozen questions. If you don’t mind, I like to just kind of throw them out and you can handle them in a sequence if you like to handle them. The first is what definition of earnings guides, the dividend declaration. Is it page 11, in the supplemental when you talk about the cash run rate of earnings? And does that coincide that definition with the 65% allowed payment of dividends in your bank agreements? That’s question one. Question two, basically I see within your CLOs, you hold roughly $200 million, I think of cash, and that’s excluding 2007-A. What incremental distribution should shareholders expect from this capital deployment as you reinvest that money? Third question basically is I think it’s about 750 million of assets to HoldCo, and what is the strategy for optimizing these assets as you look ahead? Then, basically your thoughts on the equity raise, several times on the call you talked about the lowest level of leverage in the recent history of the company, et cetera.  Can I assume that if you would resolve to an equity raise that it would be at no discount to book value net of underwriting cost? Do you still want to raise capital in the context of existing leverage and let me just see, another one I have here. You guys close your books on a daily basis. Credit has been on fire. Is it fair to say that we have the book value - well the book value we know was 860 on September 30, the book value today is higher than it was at the end of the quarter and maybe some thing will come to mind later, but I’ll have that for openness?
Michael McFerran:  Good question. The first question that you asked was definition of earnings; we really look at for purposes of distribution policy. I mean obviously the board makes a variety of debates and deliberations on dividend policy with respect to trying to distribute dividends to our shareholders that we know they look forward, but also in terms of what reinvestment rate from retained earnings we would like to redeploy back into the business to generate returns and we talked about the cash earnings figure as you suggest on page 11 is probably the best phases, is that the only way to think about distribution policy, but that would be a theoretically available cash, excess cash for distribution to shareholders to the extent that we could not find reinvestment uses of those proceeds at mid-teens rates of returns, which is what we are doing.  So if you think we’ve kind of retained about $0.25 through the first nine months of this year. We’ve reinvested that in our view at target rates of returns that should add another $0.04 of EPS on that $0.25 on an annualized basis going forward about $0.01 a quarter on target return threshold. And your second question, within our CLOs we do have restricted cash. That cash, a lot of it has been invested. It’s just a question of was it on trade versus settlement day cash. But that cash is being effectively reinvested typically out of loans that were priced to LIBOR plus 250 to 300 into loans that have LIBOR 4 175 to LIBOR plus kind of 4 to 450. And so incremental spread will result in additional cash within those structures to our shareholders going forward, which is really how our net interest margin has been expanding and therefore our cash earnings have been expanding over the past several quarters. Your third question, there is 750 million assets at HoldCo you mentioned.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  Right.
Bill Sonneborn:  What’s our strategy of maximizing and optimizing rates of return? We talked in previous conference calls; we have a couple of million of assets in our balance sheet that are effectively warehoused for purposes of giving the CLO when the terms and leverage levels and structures become attractive to our shareholders.  The remainder of our portfolio is to focus on special situations as private equity and energy and natural resource investments, where we expect – I think the unleverage rate of return on those investment is very attractive to our shareholders. And so we constantly think about where the world is going, how we are positioned, and try to optimize the make up mix and specific investments in that part of our portfolio for returns.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  In terms of – you mentioned that, to me looking at all the various credit industries, credit has been on fire here for some time. Is it safe to assume without guessing a specific number that our book value is in excess of the book value that existed on September 30th?
Bill Sonneborn:  We don’t comment on forward-looking statements with respect to...
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  This is not forward-looking, this is the book value as of yesterday.
Bill Sonneborn:  That is forward-looking from September 30th. And so, you know, I think that you can look at some of the correlations over the course of the past several quarters as to how book value has moved relative to numerous credit industries and make your own informed opinion as to what book value could be today. But we don’t disclose our daily book value to investors.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  Okay. Just one additional, one question on the answer and that was kind of philosophically the game plan on the equity raise. So I think that’s been affecting the stock. And I get a lot of calls from my friends who have got into the stock, they say about the – when is the equity offering coming. So, maybe if you can kind of explain your view there, that would be helpful. But also getting back to page 11, I’m assuming with the reinvestment opportunities that exist, all things being equal, you would expect that cash earnings number to rise?
Bill Sonneborn:  Yes. We would not be doing our job before not growing that number over time.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  So it was not yet a normalized dividend payout ratio. Technically is the cash earnings, the 65% limitation on dividends that the bank is looking at, are they looking at reported net income number?
Bill Sonneborn:  No, the limitation is based upon estimated taxable income, which can differ from that cash number, because gains effectively, which were excluded from that cash number can trigger taxation. So taxable income could be higher or lower than that number depending upon whether there are gains, losses or other tax impacting items in any one quarter a year.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  Got you. Okay. And could you tell us a little bit about the – on the one hand you’re saying that we have the lowest level of leverage that we’ve employed in quite some time, but I think there is a general desire to raise capital of what it was four or five months ago. Can you give us some insight into your thought process?
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure. We’ve talked about this in the last quarter. I mean, in our comments, we have no – we will not raise capital or discount the book value. Our shareholders, in fact, we are very focused on what the cost of the capital is if we were to raise growth capital to continue to grow or expand the business relative to all the investments we are planning and sourcing.  And so as we talk about when we pulled the equity offering last May, the cost of that capital was high relative to the arbitrage, we found attractive for our shareholders, we pulled that offering and we will not come back to the market unless we believe that it’s attractive for our shareholders full stop. This is not about diluting anyone, it’s about only positioning KFN to grow its cash flow per share earnings per share and book value per share for the foreseeable future. And the only reason to raise capital is the fact earlier is those goals.
Leon Cooperman - Omega Advisors:  Okay. It’s nice to have a tailwind, but you’ve done great job with that tailwind. Congratulations.
Bill Sonneborn:
Lee:
Operator:  Our next question will come from Wayne Cooperman with Cobalt Capital.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  Hi guys, not as many questions. Just the provision for the loan that you took in the quarter, could you just mention, go over that again. And then secondly if you were to do a CLO today, what do you think the indicative pricing might be? And then my third question would just be about, you still hold a big portfolio, or not big but not small of RMBS. Could you talk about the RMBS market, is that affected by these mortgage put back issues and what’s happening with either still held well below par value?
Michael McFerran:  Sure. On the first one, the allowance, we booked a provision of 8 million. We had a couple of charge-offs Wayne. It’s more accounting than anything, we moved two loans to our Held for Sale category, so we have brought them down the market.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  But does that mean you were planning and you didn’t want to hold them anymore?
Michael McFerran:  No, it’s just – especially at our CLOs, we always are looking to rebalance our holdings. We frequently move loans to Held for Sale to give us flexibility straight out of the things that have run up in price or we may have credit concern around the trade...
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital: 
 :
 :
Michael McFerran:  Correct, but it’s from our original cost basis, but based on risk return analysis, we may think it might be the right place to get out of something. So, our objective is at this point was to keep your allowance effectively flat, so we booked the provision of 8 million as the percentage of assets are obviously very small.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  No the numbers [inaudible]  
Michael McFerran:  On the second one, around CLOs, pricing is not the key to determine, Wayne, it’s important but there is several other variables we look at. But one is obviously leverage, which goes part and parcel with pricing. In addition to that, we are also especially focused on structure dynamics, notably reinvestment periods and non-call periods.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  Right.
Michael McFerran:  And so those seems to us are equally important as pricing, pricing definitely seems as if it’s come under, where you could do senior notes, say below LIBOR plus 200, that seems to be pushed downwards, but Bill’s prior comments we’re very, very focused around the entire structure and as we’ve been saying throughout 2010, frankly being patient would be in our benefit versus trying to rush to market with a deal, and as markets evolved throughout the year, we feel that we’re pleased that we’ve been patient and we’ll continue to watch it.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  Anything you did something by the end of the year, if you wanted to?
Michael McFerran:  I think we do a deal when we would want. The market seems to be picking up.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  I mean, at terms you are comfortable at...
Michael McFerran:  Yes. Well obviously the holiday is coming up, we’ll see that. But I think we’ll continue to stay close. Because we have a lot of, what we would call, recycling ability in our existing CLOs, we really benefit from the ability of not having to do a deal right now. Because we don’t recycle that capital on those deals we have and we don’t feel constrained by not being able to participate in new opportunities by having to do a CLO, but when it feels right we’ll do them.
Bill Sonneborn: 
 :
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  And the last part was just the RMBS portfolio?
Michael McFerran:  Yes, it’s down to 100 million, Wayne. This is the run rates of our week days, its small; it’s got a par value of about 2.5 times market.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  Yes.
Michael McFerran:  If the road improves a lot, maybe there’s a little upside there we would hope, but this is, I guess, again a one-off portfolio that I expect to see half the size, 12 to 18 months from now.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  I know guys were trying a buy up a lot of these things and get control of the trenches [ph] and put them back to the banks, I don’t know, are you involved with that, I mean are you seeing that affect the pricing at all?
Bill Sonneborn:  We’ve been looking into a variety of aspects, we expect to what’s going generally in the financial institution sector with respect to put backs and mortgages back to the original bank lenders. I have no comments to your disclosure and I think you’re expecting that, but it’s something that we are watching because it could present an opportunity for us down the road, but still developing.
Michael McFerran: Correct, there is a 140 million GAAP between par and market right now.
Wayne Cooperman - Cobalt Capital:  Thanks a lot.
Operator:  Our next question comes from [inaudible]. 
Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. I just have a quick question, I was wondering if you were one of the parties that participated in the disrupt exchange at TXU and maybe if you guys could just talk a little bit generally about how you manage potential conflict of interest between your credit investment in KKR sponsored deals.
Michael McFerran:  Sure, absolutely. I don’t think it’s probably -- I just expect to what commissions we have within 3Q other than in previous quarters we talked about virtually all of our investments being in the senior secured loan, which is secured by – which is senior to where all the exchanges took place and secured by both on core and retail in the generation business.  We generally have a number of protections with respect to investors and conflicts of interest governed by our independent directors through a committee that’s been formed called the Affiliate Transaction Committee. They review and oversee any sort of investment exposures or potential conflicts involving our private equity funds or KFN. In addition to that, the manager has established a number of policies and procedures to protect against any harm to investors at KFN from existing or potential conflicts of interest, which is ultimately overseen by a global conflicts committee at the manager level. And so, there is a number of checks and balances made to make sure that none of those things are being done in any way shape or form to damage gas and/or its investors or potential return. And in the case of the aforementioned exchange, again we are pretty much just focused on the senior secured term loan and our exposure.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for any additional or closing comments.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you all for your time today, and your continued support. Our team is doing a great job. We’ll get back to work and try to continue to grow and expand the business. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings Second Quarter Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following today’s management's prepared remarks, the conference will begin with -- today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Laurie Poggi. Laurie, please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Thank you, Melanie, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2010 conference call. During which Bill Sonneborn, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer will review the results for the quarter and answer your questions. Today, we issued our financial results release for the quarter ended June 30th, and filed our second quarter Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents together with a supplemental information packet are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.kkr.com. As required, we like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs, and the related forward-looking statements, are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings that we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. Today’s call is being webcast live on our website. The audio webcast will be archived and a telephonic replay will be available beginning later today through August 18th. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Laurie. And thank you, everyone, who has joined us for the call today. We appreciate your time and your interest in KFN. I’ll start today’s call by reviewing the highlights of the quarter. In the choppy and negative quarter in the financial market we were able to generate earnings per share of $0.51 for the quarter. Additionally, our Board of Directors today declared a cash distribution of $0.12 per share for the quarter. This represents a 20% increase in our distribution over the first quarter and our third consecutive quarter-over-quarter increase in distributions per share. Our earnings per share of $0.51 for the second quarter compares to $0.82 for the first quarter of this year and $0.14 for the second quarter of 2009. You may recall that in the first quarter we recorded a $39 million gain or $0.25 per share on the extinguishment of debt in connection with our purchase of mezzanine and subordinated notes issued by CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A. Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure we use calculated as net investment income excluding discount accretion income from early prepayments plus non-investment expenses and excluding the impact of share based compensation and incentive fees was $0.36 for the quarter as compared to $0.39 for the first quarter of 2010 and $0.22 for the second quarter of 2009. Pro forma for previously capitalized debt issuance costs they were written-off during the quarter as a result of our new revolver being put into place. Operating income per share equaled $0.40 for the quarter versus $0.39 in the previous or the first quarter. In addition, the 2009 comparative amount of $0.22 per share included a $12.8 million charge for provision for loan losses which reduced operating income for that period by $0.08 per share. Accordingly, when adjusted for these one items our operating income as our performance 33% year-over-year, driven by higher net interest margin and earnings on retain capital. Book value per share for the quarter ended June 30th was $8.08 per share, a decline from $8.31 at the end of the first quarter. This decline was due primarily to market value declines in high yield bonds, which are all reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or OCI on the balance sheet. As well as the effects of the treasury market rally during the quarter and the interest swaps primarily contain within our CLOs in which we hedge our bond positions back to floating rate. We continue to focus on the same three areas we’ve discussed last quarter. One, growing cash flow per share, two, book value per share growth, and three, growing distributions per share. While periods of volatility and high yield pricing can create quarter-over-quarter swings in book value, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to achieve all three objectives this year. For example much of the impact of the declining high yield prices in the second quarter on our book value per share as reversed itself already through the month of July. During the quarter we replaced our existing 150 million credit facility due to mature in November 2011 with a new 250 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2014. This new credit facility provides us with increase flexibility to pursue opportunities and managed cash flows. In addition, that reduces our overall costs of capital. We executed this facility in conjunction with the planned equity offering, which is a topic, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing with all of you. On May 3rd we announced an offering of 25 million common shares and on May 5th in the (inaudible) market we announced that we are withdrawing this offering. We undertook this offering to raise a modest amount of capital for new investment opportunities as we continue to reposition our capital allocation to areas of the markets where see the greatest opportunities. Although, fully subscribed at the time we pulled it, the applied costs of capital at the price of the market – price of KFN at that time was simply too high to proceed. As outlined for you on our earnings call, we remain focus on avoiding earnings and book dilution to our existing shareholders. It’s far better from our perspective to retain discipline and reinvest to substantial portion of our earnings as we have done this quarter. The obvious question in many of your minds is whether or not we planned to announced another secondary equity offering in the near future. Appealing a new credit facility with a four year maturity is significantly our flexibility to deploy capital. Accordingly we are confident that we have sufficient capital to allocate to new opportunities for the immediate future without being constraint by not having incremental equity. Consistent with past remarks in these calls we will only raise equity if we think it is accretive to our all of our shareholders. The next topic I want to touch on is the status of our CLOs, which Mike take you through in a lot more detail during his remarks. During a quarter in which credit markets were volatile, spreads increased, loan and bond prices declined, not only did our CLOs remain in compliance with the respected over-collateralization test, but in aggregate we were able to increase over-collateralization margins. In fact, to the point where all of our CLOs currently have OC ratios in excess where they were when deals were originally issued. Page 20 of our supplemental materials graphically displays this. Our continued increase in this quarter’s distribution per share is reflective of our confidence in the balance spend with management approach we are using with respect to a standing major market or position downgraded default chalk and still producing cash distributions from all of these subsidiaries. Our overall portfolio continues to perform as expected. The EBITDA and earnings of our portfolio companies have generally met or exceeded our estimates thus far this year. We have had no defaults of any holdings during 2010 and two of our modest size holdings that had been on our watch list paid off at par during the quarter. The next point I want to make with respect to our portfolio is our exposure to foreign currency price moment and sovereign debt. We do not have any sovereign debt holdings and we do not anticipate deploying capital to direct foreign debt in the future. We do have minor exposure to holdings that are denominated in foreign currencies. As of June 30th, we had a $150 million market value of holdings denominated in euro and $18 million market value of holdings denominated in British pound growth of any effective hedge. Before handing this over to Mike let me offer a thought on the economy, credit market and the impact these have on KKR financials opportunities. Needless to say, the second quarter was an interesting one, not only was the quarter volatile but the volatility itself was volatile. But the best reaching 2009 level and having five distinct peaks. In fact, on a few occasions during the second quarter it felt as if we were back in late 2008 or early 2009, experiencing the market vertical that we hoped never feel again. The results was for challenging few months for both equity and leverage credit markets as investors and dealers began focus on the impact of European sovereign debt risk, discount the strength of the global economic recovery and appreciate the ongoing fiscal and monetary policy uncertainties around the world. The S&P 500 finished the quarter down almost 12% and high yield spreads widening to both U.S and Europe by 115 basis points and 155 basis points respectively. The leveraged loan market U.S spreads widen even further by nearly 160 basis points, security dealers and other institutional market participants reduce their risk exposures throughout the quarter, which had a meaningfully negative impact on market pricing, trading volume and liquidity. Stepping back from the amplitude of that volatility however, we observe that the recent down draft has created a market where risk return in both below investment grade credit and private equity are currently quite attractive. At quarter end high yield spreads were approximately 110 basis points wider than the 20 year average, in the market where there are more senior secured bonds in this calculation than any other time. And leveraged loan prices were 280 basis points wider. Also, we believe the [faraday] market of the first quarter has turn to buyers market, we like the compensation we are receiving for risk. During the second quarter we purchased over 850 million of assets including deploying capital of the several debt and equity transactions that presents attractive risk return portfolio. The private transactions we deployed capital to included debt and equity security issued by Harden Healthcare, [Ambaya] and the Northeast Retailer. All unique proprietary opportunity sourced by our manager, as well as, allocating capital to private equity opportunities including Hilcorp Resources, an unconventional energy play in the Eagle Ford Shale and Pets at Home, the dominant pet specialty retailer in the U.K. As far as our CLOs we continue to recycle capital to higher yielding assets with the benefit of locked in low cost funding. The effective net interest spread we earn from holding at our CLOs increased to 4.22% during the second quarter, as compared to 3.93% during the first quarter and 3.54% for the second quarter of 2009. That’s a 7% increase in net interest margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter and nearly 20% increase in spread year-over-year. In addition, now about 18% of our CLO loan holdings have LIBOR 4 with the weighted average 4 of just over 2% further increasing the value of our CLO liabilities. Whether our CLOs are half away capital outside of our CLOs we are deploying capital behind a few core belief. First, a V shape economic recovery is a pie tree and the global debt hangover is far secured. Secondly, we remain concern and focus on the 2.2 trillion of debt maturities coming in the next seven years, and as a partner I like to say how the pantheon will be able to digest that pig. And finally, commodity markets will begin to show signs of emerging market exportation of inflation long before the interest curve well, and we want to be position to benefit from that outcome and our ability to grow earnings and distributions. With that, I will hand this over to Mike.
Mike McFerran: Thanks Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $0.51 per share as compared to $0.82 for the first quarter of this year. As Bill mentioned, first results were positively impacted by a $0.25 per share gain on the extinguishment of debt we recorded in connection with the purchase of mezzanine, a subordinated note issued by CLO 2007-1 and 2001-A… Operating income was $0.36 for the quarter when adjusted exclude a one-time charge of $0.04 for the write-off of debt issuance, related to our prior credit facility, our adjusted operating income was $0.40 per share. As Bill, previously highlighted, as compares to operating income of $0.22 per share the second quarter of 2009 and $0.30 per share for the quarter when excluding the provision for its loan losses we recorded. Our earnings for the quarter, included realize and unrealized gains from investments totaling $28.9 million. The same includes $58 million of realized gains in such a loan and bond position and $5 million of mark-to-market gain from certain private equity positions, one in particular was a position that went public during the quarter. These gains were offset by lower cost to market unrealized losses totaling $33.8 million and such a loan position held for sale and our transfer is held for sale during the quarter. Book value per share declined from $8.31 as of March 31st, $8.8 as of June 30th. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in other comprehensive income a component of shareholder equity of approximately $0.60 per share is attributable the declines in the market value of certain bond holdings and interest rates swaps, mezz cash flow hedge that are primary held within our CLO. I do want to highlight that since quarter end, certain of our high yield positions most notably NXP have roll back to level that approximate where they were at the end of March. Next I want to provide you with the detail update on our CLO. During the quarter, we increased the over-collateralization margin of our CLO and as of the end of June all of our CLO had OC levels extremely low, at inception of the transaction. I know this seems counter intuitive considering better OC levels will increase during the period when asset prices decline, let me spent a minute on that. As described in our 10-Q filing, OC is a critical test, non-compliance to minimum OC requirements for each deal results to the cash flow that we would otherwise receive from CLO. We need to amortize the senior bond held by third party. This was the primary source of trends we experienced in late 2008 the majority of 2009. Both assets from the CLO are not impacted by market value movement and asset prices, and the exposure of asset price movement is limited to CCC rated asset in excess of our threshold amount pre-CLO and the defaulter asset which are carried at the lower of our ready agency state recovery rate or market value. During the quarter OC increased due to several factors, first, we sold certain of our CCC rated bond holdings early in the quarter at prices in the mid to high 90s, which provided the benefit of reducing the CCC rated assets held on CLO and as result reduce the dollar amount of assets of (inaudible) to market value moment. In addition, we exit certain equity positions in our CLO which for purposes of the OC test received zero value prior to sale. Finally, certain of our largely defaulter position either paid off or resold during the quarter at attractive prices. During the quarter, we received over $35 million of net cash flows from our CLO, lastly quarter we specific that two of our CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A, which represent 8 billion – excuse me, which represent $5 billion of the $8 billion. Total assets we hold in CLO were currently paying down fixed interest on their mezzanine notes that occur during 2009 when this CLO write a compliance with the OC test. As of today, the accrued amount in the mezzanine note issued by CLO 2007-A have been paid off and we expect to remain the accrued amount on CLO 2007-1 mezzanine notes to be paid off by year-end. That said, we are the majority holder of the CLO 2007-1 mezzanine notes that still picked interest we mainly paid off and as such going forward we will receive in fact all of our share of the cash flows from this deal. Next a few comments on our balance sheet and liquidity as of quarter end, our corporate debt portfolio had an estimated fair value of 89% of par and carrying value 91% par. On the liability side, we have reduced our outstanding debt by paying off our prior credit facility, which have a $150 million outstanding as of March 31st, as Bill highlighted for you, we replace this facility in May, the $250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that matures in 2014. The new structure was attractive to us in several ways. First, our new credit facility is not only a $100 million large than the prior one, it bears interest of lower cost funding, being LIBOR plus 325 basis points, as compare to LIBOR plus 400 basis points of our prior deal. This transaction can be upside to $600 million through additional commitments. The facility also provides more flexibility around payment of dividends as it increases the cap on the percentage of estimated taxable income we can pay from 50% to 65%. As of quarter end, we had approximately $50 outstanding, which we had drawn in euros under the credit. However this – we reduce this amount to zero post quarter end and currently have the full 250 million of borrowing capacity available. With respect to cash flow, as I had already stated, our CLO’s are all cash generative to us. Based on our current holdings as of June 30th and current LIBOR rates, we have operating cash flow run rate of approximately $1 per share annually as of June 30th. Let me put some pressure on this number for you. For quarter end we reported cash of $142 million, corporate debt holding total balance sheet outside of our CLO with an estimated fair value of $533. Subsequent quarter end we pay down via same borrowings in our credit facility by just over $50 million. So on a pro forma basis we have cash and corporate debt holdings outside of our CLOs totaling approximately $625 million plus public and private equity and mortgage assets with estimated fair value totaling additional $181 million or in aggregate $806 million in fair value of assets and cash outside this CLOs. Of the $806 million the cashable portion of $90 million, effectively earning zero until deploy the new opportunities, which meet our criteria and the private equity portion will generate returns and increase as realized. Next, of the $533 million of balance sheet corporate debt holding, approximately $150 million consist of high qualities senior secured loans, as we have warehouse in our balance sheet for purposes our key restructured financing transactions. Today the yield maturity of these assets is 6.5%. The remaining $383 million of corporate debt assets on our balance sheet, which consist of our distressed and private mezzanine holdings are not marked for future transaction have a weighted average yield to maturity of approximately 14% as of year end and that doesn’t include any equity upside we have from warrants in some of those transactions. In summary, we have a lot of earnings power from our existing liquidity that we have on balance sheet and combined with our $250 million of availability on credit facility. In addition, our earnings power could be positively impacted from other items. First, our CLOs, where we continue to recycle capital, higher yielding assets as evidence by the increase in net interest spread of our CLOs was 3.93% for the first quarter to 4.22% for the second quarter. Second, as we’ve described in the past, the fully year rate nature of our assets and liabilities, these are small rates by approximately $1.6 billion. Take into account LIBOR 4 is our portfolio today, an increase of LIBOR 3% will increase our run rate by just over $0.13 per year, an increase of 5% will increase our run rate by just over $0.33 per year. Last topic I want to cover for you is leverage. As of June 30th, pro forma for the pay down outstanding borrowings on our credit facility, we have $628 million of recourse debt outstanding. About 40% of this is the 30year trust preferred securities that don’t start maturing until 2036. Hence we have $353 million of debt maturing before 2036, consistent of convertible notes with about half maturing in 2012, another half maturing in 2017. Take in to account all of our hot core debt we have just under half churn of leverage. Excluding our trust preferred securities, we have just over one churn of leverage on our balance sheet. Our holding company leverage today is lowest it has ever been since inception of KFN, yet we delivered an operating earnings, excuse me, from an earnings perspective we delivered an ROE of approximately 18% for the quarter, which is higher than historical level. In summary, we are generating attractive returns to our shareholders and less risk as measured by leverage. Our liquidity access to capital and low leverage as our balance sheet well positioned to support growth as we continue to execute on our business strategy. With that, I again, thank you for joining our call today, and Bill and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Michael Sarcone with Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Hi, guys.
Bill Sonneborn: Hi Michael. How are you?
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Good. Thanks. How are you?
Bill Sonneborn: Good.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Do think, walk us through the previously capitalized interest expense again related to your prior credit facility?
Bill Sonneborn: The dollar amount?
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Yeah.
Bill Sonneborn: Yeah. It was $6.5 million that we wrote off from it last or $0.04 per share.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: Okay. And then can you give us euro or pound exposure net of the hedges?
Bill Sonneborn: The hedge at the end of the quarter was $50 million drawn in euro under our credit facility offset by the $150 million of the asset exposure so it was net long $100 million of euros and about $18 million of pound sterling.
Michael Sarcone – Sandler O'Neill: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Gabe Poggi with FBR.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Bill Sonneborn: Hi, Gabe.
Mike McFerran: Hi, Gabe.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: A few questions here. What -- from an opportunity standpoint going forward, I assume that the boom in the issuance in July and August helps keep the CLO machine humming, Bill, Mike, is there anything specifically or any areas you’re focusing on maybe outside of the CLOs kind of in the Harden Ambaya avenues that you guys are looking at going forward. Can you think you can talk about there? And then, Mike, specifically, can you, I didn’t catch up, you are going right fast and you talked about dollar operating cash flow run rate was at annualized?
Bill Sonneborn: Yes. It was.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Okay.
Mike McFerran Mike McFerran: Yeah.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Got it. That’s all guys. Those questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Just in terms about our opportunities, Gabe, the answer to your question, of course, well, we have talked about during the first quarter earnings and then, now continues in terms of our ability outside the CLOs and in particular in the context of private equity transactions starting to occur particularly third-party, sponsors both in U.S. and Europe for our ability to deploy capital and some interesting opportunities that generate kind of whole rate returns outside of our CLOs, that are equity like which we’ve talked about, which is targeting kind of greater than 14% to 15% expected returns in an unleveraged passion outside of our unsecuritization vehicle.
Gabe Poggi – FBR: Okay. Thank you. Good quarter guys.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Gabe.
Mike McFerran: Thanks Gabe.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Hi John.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Hi. How are you?
Bill Sonneborn: Good.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: So we can quantify the potential recovery in high yield market since the quarter end what that might mean to book values using at your statement. Can you tell us my agency recovery on some of the swaps as well and how to think about those?
Bill Sonneborn: You mean the swaps really try to what their interest rate curve looks like and if you kind of look at it from a duration perspective of roughly 7 to 10 years. If you see any increase in rates from where they were 73% at the end of the quarter, you will see a reverse of GAAP affecting the swap.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. That’s a good figure to look at. Your credit profile improved lot during the quarter, your non-accruals down lot from this -- last quarter you default is nearly zero now. I wonder if you can comment on -- comment on what were the biggest holdings that may be flowed out of those categories. And given the strong credit performance in the pipeline, is there any chance for you guys to recapture some of your reserve at this point back in the book value?
Mike McFerran: I mean their reserve is just shy of 3% of our loan held from investment last year and to your second question, first, we do a bottoms-up analysis as well as the top down and certainly, for a bottoms-up perspective, we’re getting much more comfortable with the cost of risk effectively on our balance sheet. That being said, we’re also focused from our prudency perspective on having from a top down perspective of reasonable reserve for unforeseen issues that may pop up, down the road. So while there is always a chance that reserves could get reversed particularly in discussions with how GAAP works. It’s not management objective to push that.
Jeff Van Horn: Sorry, John. As far as your question on what change non-accruals, a couple of things. We licensed our holdings after entering the quarter at price points that we light. We also reduced our exposure to [Lime] and Dell, similar situation, both of which had been in default previously. And we had third position in (inaudible) Fire but actually paid of at part during the quarter.
Mike McFerran: And one way to think about that John is if you’re looking at our supplemental material that are our largest holdings and you compare that this quarter versus last quarter, you will see some of the more high risk positions aren’t any longer on that list. That’s because we took advantage of the strong market at the end of the first quarter into early April to dispose of a number of higher risk positions at attractive prices which both had the effective reducing kind of the risk profile, also helped their CLOs in terms of over OC compliance test and just from our prudency perspective taking advantage of the strengths of the market at that point in time.
John Hecht – JMP Securities:  Great. And final question, you talked about $35 million in cash flow from the quarter. I wondered how much of the quarter was 07-A following the equity fully and then how much in the quarter were you getting, you sum the components of the payments from the 07-1 to some of the securities you are holding that and just kind of stacking.
Mike McFerran: I’ll just clarify John. The 35 million we referenced was the cash flow, not the total cash flow of the company. It was our cash enclosed from our CLO holdings.
John Hecht – JMP Securities:  Yeah. Understood.
Bill Sonneborn: That’s just about half of our capital
Jeff Van Horn: About -- if you look at 07-A, I think it’s chewed about 5 million during the quarter. 07-1 contributed about 8 million. 07-A in its most recent payments finished off paying off those thick notes. 07-1 is going to keep doing that for the next one or two quarters. As I have placed our remarks in the call. Notes that are left to picked are the most junior notes in the capital structure while we own same amount of share, but we own of the sub notes. So with effect, that number, start trading close really at last quarter, 75 million to 80 million annually just for 07-1.
Bill Sonneborn: So it will pick up going forward and then it will be stable there and thereafter.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Yeah. Great. Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Leon Cooperman with Omega Advisors Incorporated.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Thank you. Hello everybody.
Bill Sonneborn: Hi Lee. How are you?
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  I’m good. Thank you. I have four or five questions, may be I discuss them and you take them anywhere you want. You guys must close your book, I guess, daily, lets say namely monthly. So here we are in August, I guess fourth. Do you have a book value number for the seven months ended July, question one. Question two, what was the taxable income in the quarter since it’s a partner LLC. I’d be curious as to that number. Third, I look if its better dollar per share run rate. Is it dollar per share cash generated by the company as an annualized rate as a run rate? And is it -- where we are today going forward, was it the second quarter annualized? So little bit more color on that? So the differential between the 90, 91% of the par, the accounting portfolio in par, rest of them I looked that was roughly 800 million. Is that a much different number now that discount from par about 800 million. And if you have any color on the performance of the mortgage portfolio, whether we might have any equity there or a hidden bombs there?
Bill Sonneborn: Okay.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  So I sure have all the questions but would stop here.
Mike McFerran:  I’ll take up. This is Mike. Lee, we do close our books daily but we have only disclosed publicly and we’ll only disclose publicly information as of quarter end as oppose to get into a monthly reporting cycle of burning their book value. But as you can think about in the context of book value, the most sensitive aspect in book value is how the high yield market performs. That will drive the aspects of volatility up or down in terms of book value per share in any one quarter.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Well, could you -- would you speak, willing to say that the book value in the month of July regained everything you lost in the second quarter.
Mike McFerran: Yeah. We say in the opening remarks of this call, we talked about the book value recovering from the high-yield component during the month of July, the aggregation that that occurred during the second quarter.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Got you. Okay.
Mike McFerran: The other question on taxable income, we -- it's so hard to kind of figure out taxable income because every single shareholder has a different taxable income. So we can really say for the quarter. We do think that based upon looking at shareholders, it helped the shares for a long period of time with a distribution rate of $0.12 per share. We’re at a run rate where every one’s going to get enough cash to pay their taxes to the best of our belief but it’s subject to a lot of variables that are out of our control. But at least we’ve gotten now to that point but we’ll continue to retain capital to reinvest. You want to talk about the $1 per share basis.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated: What does that represent basically?
Mike McFerran: Lee, that’s -- if you take a snapshot of our portfolio as of June 30 including the CLOs and again every deal has been static, that will be our annualized operating cash inflows and just give you some color around that number. First, again it is operating inflow. So it doesn’t include any one-off fees that we receive but we don’t model as well as any principal payments. Those are excluded from that. So if you keep in mind that some of the commentary we gave in call is focused around where is the earning power as in our balance sheet to increase that number, one be in the 90 million of cash we have available to deploy, two as we have $250 million of volume capacity, LIBOR plus 325. If you do math but if you borrowed 250, investors are say in the mid teens, cost of financing of [Alpha 325], you can pick up a nice revenue.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  I guess, that’s in derivative, that’s kind of what I’m thinking. In other words, you mentioned you made some very attractive investments in July, you’re less leveraged with an 80% ROV than any time in your history. So I’m assuming that we have a lot of runway to improve that dollar per share run rate of cash earnings.
Mike McFerran: And that’s what we’re focused on. Right, we’re focused on driving cash earnings per share, book vale per share and distributions per share.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  And the question of distribution per share with a new bankline if you get right to go up to 65% of earnings. So I will assume that we’re on a steady trajectory of a rising dividend and the question is what is the slope of the rise of the board, we’d like to see among our management.
Mike McFerran: That’s the question and how much capital we want to retain based upon our ability to find exciting investment opportunities. Those are variables exactly that you debate and discuss. Then you had another question on discount…
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated: About the further discount between 99 and 1% of par and par was roughly about 800 million. I don’t know what it is now.
Mike McFerran: It’s about the same.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Got it. Good job. Good work. Thank you very much.
Mike McFerran: On mortgages, you leave….
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Mortgages, right, right.
Mike McFerran: We took a big mark down in the fair value of our mortgages as we disclosed in the fourth quarter of last year. Our mortgage performance drew their first half of 2010 extract better than their expectation when we set and did that right often in the fourth quarter. So we don’t expect any negative news or shocks in the context.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Positive news must be optimistic.
Jeff Van Horn:  I think we still early in -- early on we want the portfolio smartly. We’ve not seen any trends of demonstrating that mortgage performance as grapy change and to our end, while it’s kind of meeting or exceeding our near-term expectations. It’s going to be a little while that the outside may be on the back end.
Mike McFerran: It’s a $100 million so it’s not a…
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated:  Right. You did come to across, I think, I’m reading it right that the back up in the market has created some interesting opportunities for you to put this capital that you have to work good returns.
Mike McFerran: That’s correct.
Leon Cooperman – Omega Advisors Incorporated: Thank you very much. You guys are doing very fine job. I appreciate that.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Lee.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from [Edward Ripley with CP Harlot Investments].
Edward Ripley – CP Harlot Investments: Gentlemen and congratulations on a great job.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Edward.
Edward Ripley – CP Harlot Investments: I have a, well people call it fast steady so any event, I do have some happy customers that are very pleased with the performance in the stock and of course, increasing dividend is always pretty welcome. I have a question that’s just puzzling me. As the people have asked me, if this company is a real estate investment process, organized under those rules?
Bill Sonneborn: KKR Financial is not a real estate investment trust. It’s organized as a publicly traded partnership. In May of 2007, it was at that point from it’s formation to May 2007, a REIT but it converted from a REIT to a publicly traded partnership that was driven to increase flexibility for the business to make investments outside of it’s mortgage holding which is why our mortgage portfolio now is a very modest amount of our assets and capital.
Edward Ripley – CP Harlot Investments: That’s the answer to the question and again thanks for the terrific performance.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Edward.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Robert Schwartzberg with Compass Point.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point:  Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have three questions. One, that the $6.7 million of debt issuance cost, is that a deduction to your net investment income or you loan interest revenues.
Bill Sonneborn: Yes. On that what pay was included in interest expense in the quarter. Those are reduction in net investment income.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Okay.
Bill Sonneborn: Operating earnings were $0.36 for that basis because it reduces net interest income. If you add it back, it will be $0.40 for the quarter.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right. I would have expected with the increase in your net spread, all things being equal and even adjusting for that your net investment income might have increased. Is there -- there are lot of assets come on towards the end of the quarter.
Bill Sonneborn: A lot of it is about timing.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right.
Bill Sonneborn: When assets come on and come off, and as well as when pay a awhile, there has been much long utility of LIBOR has – it did not jump a little over about 50 bits, we trace a little bit. So when assets reassess versus LIBOR as we said, we are going to have a small amount of what I would short-term wide volatility that kind of trends itself during the following three months.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right. Because the net investment income in the last quarter was $83.3 million, so even if you add back the $6.5 could be about flat and I would have expected that number maybe to increase.
Bill Sonneborn: One other point to highlight for you is we have a couple of holdings on a full status. That continue to make interest payments but because there are non accrual. One of them is a fairly decent sized holding. We actually book that income on a cash basis and they pay sum annually. So that was the payment we received in the first quarter end and that I’m going to expect in the third quarter.
Michael McFerran: So we may have certain divisions where you’ve taken a specific reserve in terms of our allowance on and then put effectively for accounting purposes on non-accruals. Now, they continue to perform and we expect them to continue to perform in terms of interest payments and so we just didn’t organized those until cash is received.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Your non-equivalence went down by a far amount, right?
Michael McFerran: Correct. Although that that amount still – for example, those position I was referring to represented I say close to $0.4 in the first quarter. So it’s meaningful.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right. So, I mean all things being equal, one might be able to expect an increase in our net investment income in the next three months.
Michael McFerran: Yeah.
Bill Sonneborn: We would expect that.
Michael McFerran: We’ve increased 7% sequentially and the net interest margin in our CLOs that should show up and increase operating earnings in future quarters.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right. And then if could asked two other questions. Do you have a breakout of – on the net realized versus unrealized gains, how much was realized versus unrealized?
Michael McFerran: If you look in our footnotes charts financial statements, specifically, the loans note and the securities note, it gives you the breakdown of actual realized amounts from the quarter. I will tell you that to put some color on that number. Of our realized versus unrealized, the majority of our results this quarter were realized. We had said, we took a $33.8 million lower of cost from market adjustment, loans out for sale. That is unrealized loss but that was offset by upwards – just under $60 million of realized gains and that we had unrealized gains of about $5 million. So most of the quarter were realized
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Mostly realize gains, actually much larger realized gains than but then it really appears on the surface.
Michael McFerran: Yeah.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: And then my last question is – there has been some discussion about reopening of the CLO market, do you have any thoughts about that and specifically how it might relate to your company?
Michael McFerran: Sure. We continue to – I will add to this. We continue to pay attention to the market. As you described in our last – our past calls, we evaluate opportunities to deploy capital to CLOs against other opportunities we see. We don’t view CLOs necessarily as the sole source of growth. That said, we continue to evaluate. We’ve seen a handful of transactions done, but they’ve been very few. And the one and the most recently last week, was more of a repack in new issue.
Bill Sonneborn: And they haven’t – They had instructions that we have talked with the markets still are not at terms, that we think are prudent for shareholders. It’s getting closer as we talked about. It continues to get closer. There’s more market appetite person, creative idea. There were evaluating and we have accumulated $150 million that Mike discussed in his remarks of CLOs eligible collateral on our balance sheet. In fact, the warehouse – because the market may open up and a very near future to our thresholds of returns.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: I’m sorry. How sparse is that number?
Bill Sonneborn: It will be about $150 million of few eligible collateral on our balance sheet outside of our CLOs warehoused.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: What do you see as the – like a minimum size that you would need in order to make it cost effective?
Bill Sonneborn: So that’s unlevered. So I mean – you put leverage against that to that – 150, would in fact would be your equity in a $500 million deal of three to one leverage.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Okay.
Bill Sonneborn: Where we stand – we’ve got assets there. We mentioned and going back to a prior question, when we said those assets are actually only earning just over 6% today. So it’s their interest. Cash yield to that capital we are sitting on, on our way into – move opportunistically into a transaction that makes sense because they are patient in doing so.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Right. Okay. Bill, great. Thank you very much.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question with Sandro Naf with Capital Four.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: Hi. I have a question regarding the loss in book value. If I do the math I get about, with the $0.51 and the $0.12 dividend, it implies decrease of about write-off of $0.60. That will be around 100 million on – about 160 million shares. Could you kind of go through, explain this said decrease, again, I think you mentioned it quickly on introduction and then I have a couple of follow-up questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Go ahead, Mike.
Mike McFerran: On the book value I guess Bill mentioned, is upon is most sensitive too our changes in higher yield bonds, so you are right. We had $0.51 of income during the quarter that’s offset by $0.10 dividend we paid during the quarter, estimates $0.41. In addition, we had about 60 center client in OCI from high yield bonds and cash flow hedges. What do you think about our earnings, who are offset by the OCI and SLOP impact our unrealized perspective in book value, just mark to market effects of declining high yielding interest rates and then you factor into $0.10 dividend distribution on top of that.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: And then – just a one sec, comment on the recovering bond prices in July, would that imply that we are going to get a big part of the $0.60 bank, all most equal.
Mike McFerran: Yeah. Its interest rates and bonds prices set extra, but everything else being equal or be equivalent in September to what they were in March. You would see that $0.60 reverse itself. That is accurate.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: Okay. The other question is going back to this run rate estimates. If I have to kind of do a normalized as total revenue and then I take the net investment income, which now has been 76, it might be a little higher going forward. We have a relatively big volatile line on the net realized and unrealized gains on the investment. Would you say this is over time or long period of time, netting each other at zero or do you think it continues to add income on unrealized gains on investments?
Mike McFerran: The unrealized gains that we’ve realized in our income statement, it could fluctuate. But if you look at other comprehensive on our balance sheet, you will see a effective embedded gain that is reflected in OCI. That gain has not come through our income statement yet. So to extend, we were to sell this positions at maturity and then effectively would growth rate seen in July and you would see that effect and so. You can compare OCI, the positive aspect of OCI quarter-to-quarter relative to that gain number in our income statement.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: So then what would you protect that line – it will be for the 2010 period and going forward, what would you expect in quarter to come?
Mike McFerran: Sandro. Just to be fair in two points. First is when we actually don’t give forecasted guidance. The second around realized and unrealized gains and investments both fund its volatile, it depends on when we decide to monetized either through exiting the position because something changed with the asset or sales and asset. But those things are lumping and this really is not east to model in, as you may have a quarter where it makes sense to hedge much positions in other quarter where it doesn’t.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: Exactly. We are investors. We try to buy things cheap and then sell them when they are expensive. And sometimes that can take years to for it actually come to a position and we have to be patient to that – once the assets point intrinsic value, we’ll sell it. And then it become a realized gain but we can predict how that works in the context of future quarters as they share future years.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: Okay. And then just to finalize in this run rate issue. And so if I take – if I’m very conservative and say, I’m haircutting to 28, it very easy to come off with an annualized as net income that is 200 to 250 a year. And if you can pay out 65% dividend, that’s – you’re getting very close to a bulk dividend share.
Mike McFerran: Just to be fair Sandro -- We say to pay out 65% dividend, it’s of our estimated taxable income which over the long-term does, they’ll pay up with reported but numbers we reported on GAAP, which are very different because they include non-tax income such as accretion on assets, unrealized gains and unrealized asset losses. So I would necessary view the GAAP income numbers as a near-term proxy. The best – as far a GAAP run rate, we articulated that for the quarter, our operating income was $0.40. I would use that as your best estimate.
Bill Sonneborn: Sandro, I pardon. We actually do want to get some other questions, but feel reach to it.
Sandro Naf – Capital Four: Okay. Thanks for answering those questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: And we will now take a follow up question from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors Inc.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors Inc.: I was very impressed you guys try to buy low sale high. You would fit in Omega, if you are ever looking for a job, I like that philosophy.
Bill Sonneborn: We have a long way to get your records.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors Inc.: I got that. Anyways, I haven’t taken eligible calculus for so long I can’t remember. But do you guys have at the top of your ahead with the $0.12 dividend with the conversion price will be on the new convert.
Bill Sonneborn: I don’t have – it is partially a function of the average trading at the stock we up to it. I know at the $0.10 we had the conversion price was between $8.10 -- $8.11.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors Inc.: 
$8.11, okay.: 
Bill Sonneborn: So I probably assume, kind of pays off that.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors Inc.: Okay. Thanks again.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you. I will thank you all for participating today on the call and we hope you have a good rest of your summer. We look forward to touching basis with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank concludes. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC first quarter conference call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following managements' prepared remarks the conference will be open for questions. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laurie Poggi. Please go ahead, Ma’am.
Laurie Poggi:
 : Our financial results released for the quarter ended March 31st, was issued today, and as with prior quarters a supplemental information packet was posted on our Website. Today we also filed our first quarter Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today’s call is being webcast live on our website. The audio webcast will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website and a telephonic replay will be available beginning later today through May 13. At this time, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities Exchange Commissions' website at www.sec.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Laurie, and thank you everyone for being on the call. We are pleased with our results for the quarter. Fortunately we were able to achieve the objectives we discussed in last quarter’s earnings call, given the continued progression of healing within the capital market. Specifically, we are able to grow our book value per share, earnings per share and raise our distribution per share for the quarter. With the actions our team has taken in the continued compression and credit spread, we’re able to generate on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, growth of nearly 13% in book value per share, and taking to account today’s decoration of the distribution over 40% in our cash distribution per share. We’re able to achieve this by continuing to maintain strength in our liquidity position in our balance sheet. Between the quarter, we purchased over 900 million of corporate debt holdings, primarily to our CLOs subsidiaries that will create long-term value for shareholders. We reduced the risks of our asset liability duration mismatch. We’ve eliminate all mark-to-mark leverage other than that contained within our credit facility and as the quarter end, all of our CLOs were incompliance with their respective over collateralization tests. Most importantly, KFN continues to be well positioned to participate in new and attractive market opportunities that we believe will generate attractive total returns for our shareholders. Today, our Board of Directors declared the cash distribution for the quarter of $0.10 per share. This distribution represent a 43% increase from last quarter’s distribution of $0.07 per share, and a doubling over the distribution of $0.05 declared for the third quarter of 2009. During the first quarter, we're into 129.5 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. Our earnings included other income primarily consisting of gain from debt repurchases and realize and unrealized gains on our investments totaling $0.45 per diluted common share. In operating income, which we defined is net investment income less non-investment expenses up $0.37 per diluted common share. As I mentioned a moment ago, all of our CLOs are in compliance with their respective OC test as a result of CLO 2007-1 regaining compliance with its over-collateralization test in late March. We continue to focus on both building additional over collateralization portion [ph] within these structures, and maximizing returns on equity and redeployment of the substantial early pay downs we have been receiving given the strength of the credit market. Additionally, during March we purchased 73 million par amount of mezzanine and subordinated notes issued by CLO 2007-1 and 10.3 million par amount of mezzanine notes issued by CLO 2007-A. These purchases were done to a third party administered public auction in the form of the (inaudible) or bids run it in competition and certain notes issued by this two CLOs that we did not own previously. The purchase of these notes across these two structures was done at a weighted average price of $0.53 a face value and resulted in a onetime non-cash reported gain of 39 million. The connection with this transaction KFN's manager elected to forgo 9.7 million in incentive fees but it otherwise would have earned on that gain. Next our capital structure. As discussed on our last earnings call, we issued a 172.5 million of 7.5% convertible notes due January 2017. Today, we have used approximately 120 million of the net proceeds from this transaction to reduce existing indebtedness to paying down our credit facility by 25 million reducing the outstanding amount to a 150 million. We also retired 95 million of 7% convertible notes to 2012, reducing the amount of outstanding from 275.8 million to a 180.6 million. Our credit facility is due to mature in November 2011 and we are proactively seeking alternatives to replace this facility in order to provide us the increased flexibility to continue to achieve the objectives we iterated at the beginning of this call and at the beginning of this year. Last, I want to spend few on our strategy. Today 90% of our corporate debt holdings are held in our majority CLO subsidiaries. These transactions have final maturities ranging between 2017 and 2021. CLOs provide us with the benefit of being able to finance senior secured and high yield corporate credit investments at a weighted average cost of LIBOR plus 57 basis points. With the weighted average remaining reinvestment period of about 2.3 years, we expect to continue to recycle capital in our CLOs to continue to produce strong earnings and cash flows after the reinvestment periods end. In fact, CLO 2007-1, CLO we just acquired addition sub-notes, which are largest CLO has not reached the end of its reinvestment period until May of 2014 near the end of what we expect to be in active refinancing period for global corporation. We continue to operate with a portfolio that asset sensitive to interest rates. Given our focus on protecting earning and cash flow as well as our ability to provide distribution to shareholders from threats of inflation, we retain approximately 1.6 billion of net asset sensitivity today to short-term rates. All those being equal, if LIBOR were to return to previous historical average levels of say 5% gross earnings per share and cash flow per share would increase by approximately $0.10 per quarter. The CLO market has recently found some signs and new transactions are starting to get done. We intend to establish additional majority own CLO subsidiaries in the future, but at terms with the financial and structural characteristics are appealing to permit mid teens returns on capital deployed. While there is a market for senior trenches, the senior notes spreads provided recent deals when combined with other structural terms such as leverage in reinvestment on call period not allow us to achieve an appropriate higher rate for our shareholders. That said, spreads continue to tighten, another terms continue to improve, so the market may become more interesting in the weeks and months ahead. With respect to our current holdings, we remained pleased with our portfolios performance during this current credit cycle. As of March 31st, the weighted-average market value of our corporate debt holdings was 91% of par value. The weighted-average carrying value of our holdings, which is what our book value of 831, reflects was 90% of par value. Simply put today, our book value is below the estimated market or liquidation value of our holdings as if quarter end by 1% of the par value of our entire corporate debt portfolio to about 80.3 million. While 90% of our aggregate corporate debt holdings are in CLOs today, we had expected to decline modestly overtime as we deploy capital to other opportunities outside of CLOs. I think it is worth recapping our framework for the deploying capital as reviewed in our last earnings call. Our framework is based on our internal strategic capital allocation model. As we discussed last quarter, there are three core tenets to our capital allocation methodology. First, to provide our shareholders with an attractive total return by balancing holdings that generate solid recurring cash flows enable us to make distributions to the shareholders and those that present opportunities to the long-term capital appreciation with substantial positive skew and to share our cash profits with our share holders. Second, positioned our portfolio to generate attracting total returns across economic cycles. We have a bias towards addressing inflation risk in our portfolio. We seek to position that portfolio to perform well during periods of high inflation, which correspond with higher rates. We want to focus on creating a return profile and a dividend paying capability which will benefit in arising rate environment. Third pursue opportunities where we at KKR believe we have a competitive advantage. The combination of our global investment team and our deep relationships across many industries provide us with an unparalleled ability to source unique opportunities across many asset classes. In addition, syndicated corporate debt, we are wait to see opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital to unique and special situations which range some private debt transactions that resourced to rescue finance, the stress to mezzanine opportunities we see the potential for attractive total returns from both debt and equity components. Examples of recent transactions we completed this past quarter include harden health care and (inaudible) also which present opportunities for expected unlevered meet the high teams returns. The next area of opportunity we see room to allocate incremental capital today in two private equity. Broad industry meeting roll in this asset class we expected to be a growing a way of opportunities for KFN to deployed capital side-by-side with KKRs private equity funds and select private equity opportunities. For example this past quarter we made a modest side-by-side investment with KKRs private equity funds and fix it whole. And finally, we review investments in real assets such as conventional oil and gas working interest as attractive in the current environment. In February KKR announced the partnership with Premier Natural Resources. A firm whose executive have the fantastic track record in conventional resource place and with whom we have worked in a number of private equity transactions over the years. To peruse investments in conventional oil and gas properties in North America. KFN will be a beneficiary this partnership as we plan to make investments and producing oil and gas properties with attractive cash-on-cash and total return characteristics and little to no exploration risk. We view opportunities in this sector as particularly compelling as they present both attractive return profiles, good current cash flow and a sound hedge in our portfolio against inflation. To summarize, we remain optimistic in our ability to achieve the strategy we have put forth to you. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Mike to review the results for the quarter in more detail.
Michael McFerran:
 : Our March 31st, balance sheet reflects the fair value of our holdings in RMBS, which totaled $114 million. The change of presentation is a result of our adoption of FAS 157, which amended the consolidated requirements of variable interest entities previously covered by FIN 46. Neither the prior consolidation of the MBS Trust nor they recent deconsolidation of these trusts had any impact of book value, cash flows or our results of operations. Now for the quarter. As Bill highlighted, our results for the first quarter was net income $129.5 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. The quarter’s earnings were largely driven by $71.1 million or $0.45 per diluted common share of other income. The two largest contributors of other income were $27.3 million of realized gains from sales of certain holdings and $40 million in gains from repurchases of debt, including $38.7 million in the purchase of CLO notes issued CLO 2007-1 and CLO 2007-A. As you know, we consolidate our CLOs under GAAP. As such, the assets of our CLOs and debt issued by our CLOs, that we do not own is reflected in our balance sheet at par. Purchases of note issued by our CLOs are kind of force reductions of debt in our balance sheet. The gain is recorded for the difference between our purchase price and the face amount of the notes. The $27.3 million of realize gains during the quarter stems from the sales of certain equity loan and bond positions. We achieved desirable outcomes based on current market value. Putting the $27.3 million, our gains from holdings that were previously in default and have restructured with us existing at a gain above our regional purchase price. These will put some over all of our holdings in layer and by law, which are examples of situations where the loans defaulted. We patiently worked through the process to achieve returns above if not only our cost basis, the actual reason par value be loan to be invested in. Respect to cash flows, our net operating cash flows this quarter totaled approximately $36 million. Put some color on this, we didn’t receive any payments on our CLO 2007-1 and to CLO 2007-A, suborned note holdings during the quarter. Both CLO 2007-1 and CLO 2007-A we’re out of complains for the respective over quarterization test throughout 2009. As Bill mentioned, both these CLOs were in compliance with those test as of today. The mezzanine bonds issued by CLO 2007-1 or 2007-A, which we on the majority of accrued interest through the period of those CLOs were out to compliance the OC tests of 2009. And as a result that accrued interest on those mezzanine bonds needs to be paid-off before we start receiving cash flows on the subordinate notes we own. The accrued amounts on the CLO 2007-A mezz bonds should be paid-off this month. However, for CLO 2007-1, approximate paying up that accrued should take about a year. Well, there’s no assurance that our CLOs will remaining compliance with these OC test, assuming that they do so and based on current LIBOR plus 30 basis points and the current holdings in CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A. We estimate that once we start receiving all the cash flows from these field once all the accrued interest and mezz notes is pay down those cash flows in aggregate should benefit the company to amount about a $100 million annually. And this amount has the potential increase and we redeploy capital from pay downs and these portfolios are higher yielding assets. In addition, future increases in short-term rates by the positive impact on the cash flows that we earned from the new CLOs. With that, I am going to hand it back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Mike. Before opening it up to questions from all of you I want to provide some closing remarks. 2009 was the year defined by addressing liquidity in market risks presented by the credit crises to improve the health of our portfolio, our capital structure and deploy capital and some interesting in that. 2010 is about growth opportunities. Our capital structure liquidity profile and balance sheet are positioned to support the next stage in KFN’s evolution. And we continue to seek substantial opportunities deploy capital in a manner that it accretive to shareholders. We remained focused on refinancing our existing credit facility to improve our flexibility and may considering equity except we can deploy capital at attractive return levels. Having a flexible capital allocation model combined with KKRs global and talent professional’s knowledge from our existing portfolio businesses and experienced loan, bonds, mezzanine distress, private equity and real assets enable us to pursue opportunities that we like at any given time. Our global reach across industries in asset classes positions us to identify broader way of opportunities that we are working on today. KFN is managed by all of us at KKR. We are exceptionally talented group of people that have worked together with creativity and determination to provide KFN with substantial opportunities for value creation. We have a tremendous team, which continues to grow in both size and strength. I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the quarters ahead. With that, operator we’d be happy to turn it over for questions.

Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets:
 :
Bill Sonneborn:
 :
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets: Doing good. Two quick questions for you but they are more, one is broader macro question and then one is more name [ph] is the credit specific. First question is, Bill, can you just provide your thoughts on what's happening in Europe and how that affects KFN's portfolio? And then the second question is Lyondell is emerging from bankruptcy, can you walk through how that helps or what the net effect is for KFN considering Lyondell 11th largest position?
Bill Sonneborn: Sure, absolutely. First on Europe and particularly Greece and thinking about the downgrades that are happening in Europe, and it just a macro causing move, really the same kind of challenges and issues we have here in the US when you look at state finance. And why I think that there is some potential for sparks of nervousness in the context to market volatility. It's ultimately an issue of dealing with spending problem and balancing what sense of an entitlement in the context of state or country budget are relative to revenue production. And so, that ultimately is part of the de-leveraging process that I think the entire globe will need to face as result of large public debt balances that exist relatively globally at least in developed markets. So I think in that particular case, it doesn’t necessarily have a specific direct risk in the context to KFN's portfolio. Other than we expect things like Greece or Portugal or Ireland or California can have an impact in the context to volatility underlying credit pries, which we are trying to position the, the company to take advantage of winning FA [ph] exist.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Great, thanks.
Bill Sonneborn: And the other question on Lyondell?
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets: Yes.
Bill Sonneborn: The Lyondell was a substantial holding that we’ve had for a considerable period of time. The company went through restructuring, we not only basically persuading continue to hold our position to restructuring but also participate in the exit financing. So, what you seeing there is effectively kind of the life cycle of the situation where we were senior in the capital structure and move through the restructuring process.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets: How does that one follow-up there on Lyondell, how is that, if you guys get cash and equity out in the emergent, how does that affect OC tests? Because, is there any effect there what is the compliance trigger, how does that work its way out?
Bill Sonneborn: We are completely out of the, what was the cam [ph] position in the context of Lyondell which was the portion that would be converted to equity in the context of our CLOs to extends a existing loan or bond is converted to equity, one of the debt [ph], it does get convert into equity as the account zero for over-collateralization. The structured finance vehicles are not high yield places for purposes of holding securities that you are taking, a distract call in the context that we are restructuring, because of that impact in over-collateralization. Situations where we have had a situation like that, we’ve held on to those positions until we thought that they were at fundamental value on the context of our vehicles and then sold the underline securities.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks very helpful and great quarter guys.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations in another great positive quarter and thanks for taking my questions.
Bill Sonneborn: Sure. John, thank you.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: First question is little bit of a modeling question. We deployed about $900 million of new investment this quarter. Are those that yields similar to the current average yield higher lower, how should we think about that?
Bill Sonneborn: One thing is spread, if you think of net interest margin crept up by about into numbers of about 40 basis points this quarter, some of that has to do with the LIBOR for effect and the supplemental materials we posted on the website, John, we disclosed in a very tiny font in the footnote (inaudible). The percentage of each of our CLOs now that having LIBOR floor and that is a – will be an interesting of being able to measure not only growth spread which we disclosed in the context of structures, but also the evidence of the floor which put LIBOR at 30 basis points in a weighted average floor north of 2%, for about I think the number is 15% of our portfolio from a much smaller base a quarter ago. Although, we continue to hopefully build net interest spread in context of our structures. The one thing we have to adjust your model is what amount of bonds we have in the context of our bond basket within our structured finance subsidiary that can also affects spread.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. I see those footnotes. Thanks for putting those out. Second, Mike you mentioned '07-A, '07-1 when fully we have got them paid off to mezzanine cumulative interest will be tax rate on 100 million a year, if I heard you correctly. Can you just briefly give me the breakdown of those '07-A versus '07-1, given the different timing when you guys will start receiving those cash flows?
Michael McFerran: So, 07-A we expect all, in fact that accrued interest in those Mezz bond I referenced we paid off this month, so going forward we’d expect to start receiving all of our payments on the sub-notes. That will amount to get all of since that to about 25 million a year. And then in 07-1 it will take about 12 months before we payout all those mezz accrued interest, that amount to about 75 million, again based on everything static today. Obviously, (inaudible) with 07-1 and 07-A, we deal on the majority of the mezzanine as well. So, are certain to see substantial cash flows during that period.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay, thanks very much for that color. Final question, you guys had substantial decline non-accrual and certain defaults I guess once again. Can you give us some color on this either outflows of that, was that some case related, some related to the (inaudible) events like that or was it some other activities going on in the portfolio?
Michael McFerran: It's a couple of things John. When you look at our historical defaults they really range from December 2008 to through May 2009, we saw slight defaults were after slight Tribune, Lyondell, (inaudible). On our last earnings call I mentioned I think our 2009, and our default was plus 9% but the second half of 2009 was about 90 basis points. And we haven't any defaults happened as far in 2010. So, we are seeing is that the capital markets have improved, issues are lot more flexibility to get amendments done and take other actions to avoid defaults in those positions. You’ve seen the defaults comes down and it seems they had defaults done are starting to work through as they don’t describe by Lyondell for example are showing a kind of really comparable cycle to encircle to exit defaults Lyondell is one example. They have but we are embedded with the traditions we’ve exhibit that’s why we’re not accruals to them.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Wonderful. Thanks, guys. Very much.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Thank you. And I’ll add my congratulations to everybody else. Very nice to meet you.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Lee.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Just a few questions. If I can get a map and you can handle in and you have a lot of importance so might had – in the past calls, you’ve reiterated new numerous time that the intension of the board management is to have a 50% dividend payout ratio. And obviously results vary quarter-by-quarter but what was the taxable income in the quarter and kind of how you arrive with the $0.10 dividends it seems like a much lower than 50% pay out. Let me just kind of give you all the questions you can handle in order vector that doesn’t makes the more sense for you and may be related to that question is what's the most restricted covenant presently we have that will affect our ability to believe to pay dividend. Thirdly, I’m trying to figure out the significance of the discount from part of the portfolio and so if you could help me out and appreciated we're roughly 90, 91% of par I believe with difference between par and that 91% numbers almost a $1 billion and so could one assume that if credit markets stay healthy the economy did better. At some significant part does that $1 billion discount would come back to us in the way it came into book value? And then lastly, since I've, always kind a look long-term in to the run-rates of earnings. Looking at a year from now if you're – forget about any capital gains, forget about the new reinvestment, what kind of run rate of earnings will be generating at about existing portfolio assuming all the five sellers, we have the cash flowing? Any help you could in that regard will be appreciated those are the questions for now?
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks. Lee, I'll trying to address each your question as we've indicate in the last earnings call it is our intention and it's been something we have discussed with the boards management intention and I think the boards intention as well to payout a minimum of 50% of our taxable income to shareholders that shareholders have the ample cash so satisfy any tax liabilities. As far as estimating taxable income, it’s very impossible to do because just being upon when people purchase stock that really drives the basis of their stock who strives with their pro added allocation of potential tax liabilities are. A, B and the connection what's kind of restarting our dividend policy in the fourth quarter of last year, so maybe the board has discussed is focusing on situations that never having to hopefully decreased the dividend again, so we're seeing quarter-over-quarter now for the third quarter as a progressive increase in our distribution for share. And finally we still are under a restricted covenant our credit facility, which goes to your second question the limits our dividends to no more than 50% of taxable, estimated taxable income. But ultimately, it remains our goal to distribute at least 50% of taxable income to shareholders. And your final question on the context of discount at par, yes, holding our portfolio at roughly 90, 91 as you suggest results to expect that we can recover full par on our portfolio, nearly $800 million of additional book value across the business, and it is hopefully the team's goal to achieve that objective but no guarantees. As far as your point run rate or forecasting out what our run rate operating earnings or net income is, we do not give any forecast. Now, we try to disclose as much information in the context of the components of each of our CLOs, the assets we hold for investors to be able to calculate an expectation of that rate of return and ultimate earnings.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Let me – since I know you don’t want me to be responsible, our work suggest that looking at a year from today, that you could be at a run rate of a couple of bucks which would imply $1 dividend, and we get some chuck of the $800 million back. Are we kind of in the right zip code or are we just missing something?
Bill Sonneborn: I think it really depends on what you are assuming rates over the next year, how we deploy capital. There is a lot of variables there as we talked about. If you look at our balance sheet, you can see we have a – we didn’t want a cash, we think about we fight [ph] with our CLOs, so there is a lot of – I could see how you can get up to that number based on different assumptions.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: All right, just give you a chance. Okay, thank you very much. Good work, we really appreciate it.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Lee.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Monathan [ph] with Monathan Jack Partners [ph].
Steve Monathan – Monathan Jack Partners: Good afternoon. Just kind of following of along some of the strategic comments that you made. How do you plan to balance your capital allocation between debt and private equity investments?
Bill Sonneborn: Well, by generally focused that we have indicated in the context of the strategy on to be a yield producing vehicle. And so, that would force us to focus predominantly on assets that generate cash flow for purposes of making distribution to shareholder. But we want to on top of that provide opportunities for increasing total rates of return with positive skew to the upside until that gives you an idea of how we think about, how private equity can complement the overall portfolio.
Steve Monathan – Monathan Jack Partners: In your mind, is there a rough percentage of the balance sheet that you would feel comfortable allocating to private equity?
Bill Sonneborn: We haven’t disclosed what and how we think about allocation from time-to-time to specific private equity investments. But again, if you think about our goal of producing, growing, distributions per share as well as book value per share in the context of what the objectives management is way out for the shareholders, you should probably will think about how we would allocate to and I think at last, that is non-cash flow producing until it exit.
Steve Monathan – Monathan Jack Partners: And, finally would a viewed toward the last couple of years as your current financial position, how do you see yourselves deploying the cash that’s on the balance sheet. Do you see it happening quickly or kind a slowly overtime?
Bill Sonneborn: If you think we have cash in the balance sheet, but it roughly equates to the maturities we have over the course of the next 18 months. So, fact that we’ve immunized or isolated the near-term maturities related to that cash. That being said, to except we were to refinance our credit facility as example and to a longer dated facility that would free up capital from investments. So many opportunities we discussed like hurdle or embed [ph] which have mid to high-teens rates of return with the longer duration for compounding those rates to return. So, we just balance, you know the ultimate duration of investments we make relative to risks sensitivity in the context of our capital structure.
Steve Monathan – Monathan Jack Partners: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Martini with ECI.
Sam Martini – ECI: Hey, guys. Just two quick follow-ups. As ’07-1 turns back on, all the deferrals of the notes that are deferring should come back faster. They will get trued up pretty quickly. Would you expect to consider that contribute to taxable income as the see through each notes, cheer that deferrals. And secondly, I was hoping you could walk through some thoughts on incremental CLO as a follow I think the worlds cautioned (inaudible) a few others are coming out. It looks like 3.5 to 4.5 times leveraged. Would you be able to execute something from the HoldCo [ph] pool of debt that sits there and if so could you walk us through the economics that these current deals would imply? Thanks.
Bill Sonneborn: Sure. Thanks. On your first question, no, there is no tax – taxable income increases the result of these CLOs becoming on cash flow in either in the context is paying off picked interest in the Mezz notes we hold or making payments with subordinated hold – subordinated note holder which is us as a result of the fact that those are flow through structures in the context of for tax purposes.
Sam Martini – ECI: So that will just come over the deferrals when they care in the water fall and the time is right, that will be just cash to you, it wouldn’t have a taxable impact and I’ll just go straight to that the notes that are held at the HoldCo that will just be cash that goes right to HoldCo?
Bill Sonneborn: Exactly, the taxable allocation is been made already for the interest that’s back to our shareholders and their payment of the cash is just the cash received but our shareholders last year were allocated taxable income from the amount picked during 2009 as an example.
Sam Martini – ECI: Okay.
Bill Sonneborn: Your second question.
Sam Martini – ECI: Any idea for your pieces Bill, what that amount will be what piece of your ’07-1 and ’07-A Mezz notes are just the remaining pick piece, so the remaining piece has been differed?
Bill Sonneborn: We haven't disclosed that. We said, again for '07-A the PIK fees we paid off this month, 07-1 we’re seeing will take about year or so. Thinking about the cash flows in 07-1, that will come in same that order, assuming about four payments for those PIKs out there.
Sam Martini – ECI: Okay. But it's about 400 million of notional at the HOCO [ph] rates, so all of those pieces include, I’m assuming a year and half of PIK interest on top of it.
Bill Sonneborn: Yes
Sam Martini – ECI: That will just come – okay. Thanks. And then on the market for new deal?
Bill Sonneborn: We’ve looked at the new deals that have come out and can continue to kind of investigate how this prices and structures are working. We haven't seen one, even though we have the ability to do a structure or a deal without a management fee and with the equity funded off of our balance sheet which is kind of tough part of the capital structure to find in the context of the reinvention of the CLO marketplace. We haven't found the structural term yet both in the context of the amount of leverage, the cost of the senior leverage and the call provisions or the reinvestment provision for us to feel comfortable in terms of how we look at risk and those structures and sources of return for our shareholders to get to mid teen. There are couple 100 basis points short in the context of our estimation. But they have come in towards kind of our target a lot in the past kind of 30 to 45 days, and so it's getting closer to the point where there will be attractive source to deployment of capital.
Sam Martini – ECI: But, am I thinking about it at the right way, Bill, that rather than traditional structure we had at the warehouse facility to buy the collateral. You actually own the collateral already right now, retained piece would basically be almost like a – basically be almost like a block trade or liquidation of let's say, on a four times leveraged structure of 75% of your collateral, which will replaced by cash coming into you from the CLO notes?
Bill Sonneborn: That’s exactly right. If you think about it outside of our CLOs we have a bunch of corporate credit assets, those corporate credit assets could be used. Some portion of them could be used as collateral for a securitization as non balance sheet term financing like we've done in the past without using a third party provided warehouse like historically we're used in the context restructured finance.
Sam Martini – ECI: And in terms of your – in terms of your higher bonds, it looks like they're all basically at par. So, that you extend the ratios almost to work out. Would it be fair to say that, that would free up if you did a four times leverage structure closed to $350 million in cash to you? From the whole co-collateral assuming it was all….
Bill Sonneborn: Assuming, it was all eligible for a structure but that’s an incorrect assumption. If you look through the fair value discloser, I’ll thank you, you will see that our numbers and the positions our balance sheet either a private or it's in transactions or distressed position that we've acquired, which would not be still eligible.
Sam Martini – ECI: It will be safe to say that if that – that if we win through the CLO eligible pieces that methodology would be reasonable?
Bill Sonneborn: Yes. It will…
Sam Martini – ECI: If we shifted out from the 580, what was CLO eligible? That’s kind of the right way to think about it?
Bill Sonneborn: Yes.
Sam Martini – ECI: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Robert Schwartzberg with Compass Point.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Good evening. I just had a quick book keeping question. I noticed the related party management compensation 20.5 million versus 8.2 million looks like in the fourth quarter. I assume that incentive comps which you've more than earned? But I just wanted to double check that there are no onetime expenses in there?
Bill Sonneborn: That's exactly correct. The entire amount of the increase is due to an incentive fee net of what we’ve raised because of the accounting gain from the purchases of the CLO note. So, would have been roughly a $20 million incentive fee and we raised 9.7 million of that into interest accounting on the balance sheet and not through economic gain for shareholders and so that’s the net amount.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Great. And then I sort of came out a little late. Did you discussed in terms of the yield on the loans paid down versus the yield on the 900 million of new investments the differential there?
Bill Sonneborn: Yeah. We didn’t disclose that specifically. We talked a little bit about what net interest margin is increased by approximately 20 basis points of spread 20 or 30 basis points of spread quarter-over-quarter in aggregate, which gives you a little bit of idea and we started the disclosure in our supplemental materials of each of our CLOs in the context in the overall portfolio, what spread the quite sort of easier to understand how reinvestment is affecting overall spreads in our portfolio is going forward.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: And then my last question if I can ask one more is there anything – any status update on Tribune you can provide?
Bill Sonneborn: Yes, the only thing we can talk about Tribune is what you would be able to access publicly in the context still looking any other company’s filings.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Okay. Thank you. Great quarter.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no other questions from the phones at this time, Mr. Sonneborn I will turn the conference back over to you.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you very much. And thank you all for listening to the call today and we appreciate your support and we will continue try to execute on your behalf. Thanks, have a good evening.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC fourth quarter and 2009 year-end earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I now would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laurie Poggi, Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management. 
Laurie Poggi:  Good afternoon and welcome to KFN’s fourth quarter 2009 conference call. I am Laurie Poggi, Director of Investor Relations for KKR Financial Holdings LLC and participating on today’s call are Bill Sonneborn, the company’s Chief Executive Officer; Michael McFerran, the company’s Chief Operating Officer and Jeff Van Horn, the company’s Chief Financial Officer.  Our financial results released for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 was issued today, and as with prior quarters a supplemental information packet was posted on our Web site. Today we also filed our 2009 annual report on form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call is being webcast live on our Web site and a recording will be available beginning later today through March 15th. The audio webcast will be archived in the Investor Relations section of the company’s Web site as well.  At this time, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the SEC’s Web site at www.sec.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.  Now, I will turn the call over to management. Bill, please go ahead. 
Bill Sonneborn:  Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon everyone. We are going to cover a considerable amount of information today including a review of our fourth quarter earnings our balance sheet and liquidity and our strategic growth plan. As Laurie mentioned we have posted a supplemental presentation on our website today.  Based on investor questions during the past few quarters we have updated the presentation to include more disclosure than we have provided in past periods most notably around our CLOs and I encourage you to review it in conjunction with our earnings release.  KFN today is a much healthier business than it was a year ago. We have addressed KFN’s capital structure and liquidity challenges and have dry powder available to deploy to new investment and other opportunities. As we sit here today we are excited about the future of KFN. We like our corporate structure and the flexibility it provides. Our balance sheet is strong with improved risk profiles and we are well positioned to participate in a broad array of opportunities to generate attractive total returns for our shareholders.  Later in the call I will discuss how we think about capital allocation and returns on invested capital but first let me begin with an update on KFN since our last earnings call posted this past November. Over 90% of our corporate debt portfolio is held in our wholly owned and majority owned CLO subsidiaries. Accordingly the majority of our cash flows have historically come from our mezzanine and subordinated note holdings than CLOs. Our liquidity profile has materially improved as we have continued to bring our CLOs into compliance with their respective over-collateralization (OC) tests.  Here is the status of our five CLOs. First, CLO 2005-1 which has consistently maintained compliance with its subordinated over-collateralization test. Second, CLO 2005-2 which was out of compliance with its subordinate OC test between February 2009 and May 2009 has been back in compliance since that date. Third, CLO 2006-1 which began failing its respective subordinate OC tests in November 2008, regained compliance with its subordinate OC test in August of 2009. Fourth, CLO 2007-A which began failing its respective subordinate OC test in January 2009, regained compliance with its subordinate OC test on January 4, 2010 as previous disclosure we have made. Last, CLO 2007-1 which has regained compliance with its senior OC test as of February 5, 2010. This is relevant and a new disclosure. Since KFN owns a portion of the class D notes in 2007-1 KFN received a payment of $7.5 million of cash during February for passing this test. This represents a partial payment of PIC interest on the notes we hold for the class D. This represents the first cash flow that KFN has received from CLO 2007-1 since November 2008. The last hurdle for all of our CLOs to generating cash flow for all tranches we hold is for CLO 2007-1 to regain compliance with its subordinate OC test. We are focused on bringing this CLO back into compliance, balanced with the objective of maximizing long-term value for this CLO.  There are several variables that will impact when 2007-1 comes back into compliance with its subordinate OC test including but not limited to CCC asset prices, any credit rating upgrades and downgrades of our underlying portfolio position, defaults or any asset prepayment. While we are unable to provide you with a firm date as to when 2007-1 will regain compliance with all of its OC tests we do expect that absent unforeseen events we will regain compliance with all of the 2007-1 OC tests over the next six months.  Given that KFN now generates ample operating cash flow even excluding 2007-1 we are moving more of our focus to total rates of return reflecting the discounting of all future opportunities to attract value through our structured finance vehicle.  Next, our capital structure. On January 15 of this year we issued 172.5 million of 7.5% convertible notes due January 2017. We received net proceeds from this transaction of $167 million which we expect to use to reduce existing indebtedness. This transaction was completed with an initial conversion price of $8.18 per share which represents greater than a 10% premium of $7.37 per share and approximates a 30% premium to our closing share price on the date before January 15th.  Since the completion of this offering we have reduced borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility from $175 million as of year-end to $150 million today and we have repurchased $95.2 million of our 7% convertible notes due 2012 resulting in a current outstanding balance of these notes of $180.6 million. The successful completion of this transaction has provided us with increased balance sheet flexibility to manage our future debt maturities and very importantly has substantially reduced the risk of our asset liability duration mismatch we have carried for several years now.  On dividend expectations I know that dividends are very important to our shareholders and I do want to spend a few minutes describing this. On February 4th our board of directors declared a cash distribution of $0.07 per common share payable on March 4th. This distribution represents a 40% increase from last quarter’s $0.05 per share distribution. As a dividend paying enterprise having a flow through tax structure it is important to avoid double taxation for our shareholders.  Accordingly the legal structure alternatives to achieve this are either being a REIT, a business development company or a publically traded partnership (PTP). Being a PTP affords us more flexibility than either of these alternative structures in a few key ways. First, we have more flexibility in asset mix than we otherwise would as a REIT or a BDC.  As a REIT, for example, we would be subject to certain minimum income and asset tests including having 75% of our gross income come from real estate related income and 75% of our assets consisting of real property or loans secured by real property. As a business development company or BDC we would be subject to numerous restrictions including the inability to make investments in other than small cap entities that have public equity outstanding and the inability to invest in debt of affiliates. The comparative flexibility we have as a PTP provides us with the ability to seek the best opportunities to provide an attractive total return to our shareholders.  With respect to dividends our status as a PTP allows our board of directors to determine the dividend amount on a quarterly basis. Prior to our conversion from a REIT to a PTP in May of 2007 we were required to effectively distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income to shareholders annually. If we were a BDC we would be subject to a similar requirement. By structuring the PTP affords us great flexibility with respect to dividends and enables us to optimally allocate our income between dividends and new opportunities to the extent we believe incremental returns to our shareholders would be attractive and accretive relative to their expected equity return targets.  This flexibility permits us to generate both an attractive dividend yield while increasing both future cash flows and book value through new opportunities. Our primary dividend objective is to pay out a dividend level that at a minimum approximates the estimated tax liability of our shareholders based on our estimated annual taxable income. I do want to highlight that our existing senior secured credit facility currently limits our dividend payment to 50% of estimated taxable income. We have to estimate taxable income on behalf of all of our shareholders and each shareholder has a different allocatable income depending upon the date of their purchase.  With that I am going to hand this over to Mike. 
Michael McFerran :  Thanks Bill and good afternoon. My comments today will cover several areas; liquidity, income drivers for the fourth quarter, our balance sheet, default and recovery rates on our portfolio and the impact of interest rates on our portfolio.  Beginning with liquidity, at year-end we had unrestricted cash of $97.1 million. At the holding company level our operating cash flow before shareholder distributions for the year totaled just over $69 million and $25 million for the fourth quarter. This excludes any cash flow from CLO 2007-A and CLO 2007-1 which does not begin generating cash flow until the first quarter this year as Bill described.  During 2009 the components of the $69 million of operating cash flows before shareholder distribution are as follows; $49 million in-flows from CLO 2005-1, 2005-2 and 2006-1, $84 million from positions held outside of our CLO including mortgages, $34 million paid for interest expense, $28 million paid for non-investment expenses including management fees and approximately $8 million in flow from our derivative positions consisting of total rate of return and credit default swap.  As of December 31, our cash plus the estimated fair value of our corporate debt positions held outside of our CLOs totaled $685.6 million as compared to outstanding holding company debt maturing before 2036 at year-end totaling $450.8 million. This means that we have 1.5 times asset coverage from our cash and debt positions, not in our CLOs. When combined with our mortgage portfolio and our equity holdings we have approximately two times coverage of our debt maturing prior to 2036.  The next topic is fourth quarter results. Net income for the fourth quarter totaled $2.1 million or $0.01 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $67.2 million or $0.42 per common share for the third quarter of 2009. Operating income for the fourth quarter which we define as net investment income less non-investment expenses, totaled $65.1 million or $0.41 per diluted common share as compared to $54.2 million or $0.35 per diluted common share for the third quarter.  Included in net investment income are one-time income amounts from early prepayment of investments that have been carried at a discount to par. This accelerated component of discounted appreciated income which is included in net investment income totaled $10 million for the fourth quarter and $2.7 million for the third quarter. When adjusted to exclude these one-time gains pro forma operating income for the fourth quarter was $55.1 million or $0.35 per common share and pro forma operating income for the third quarter was $51.5 million or $0.33 per common share.    The difference between our operating income for the quarter of $0.41 per diluted common share and net income of $0.01 per diluted common share is attributable to other net losses during the quarter of $62.9 million. The $62.9 million of other net losses due to several components I will spend a moment walking you through.  The largest contributor to this loss was a write down of the residential mortgage backed securities portfolio held primarily by our REIT subsidiary during the quarter of $62.5 million. The charge reflects our negative outlook for prime mortgage loan performance based on current market factors most notably high unemployment and declining housing values which have translated into an increased expectation on our part regarding expected delinquencies and losses on the residential mortgage loans that collateralize our RMBS position.  As of December 31, our RMBS portfolio had an aggregate par value of $278.4 million and an aggregate fair value estimated of $121.9 million. AS of year-end our RMBS holdings constitute less than 3% of our total portfolio.  Next we had aggregate net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $6.7 million. This amount reflects a $12.1 million charge related to the transfer of certain corporate loans from held for investment to held for sale before they were written down to the lower of cost or market value. As reflected in our balance sheet, loans held for sale held loans totaling $925.7 million as of year-end as compared to $504.1 million at the end of the third quarter. The increase in loans held for sale reflects the balance sheet flexibility we desire to sell loans and improve the credit quality of our CLOs and in particular to facilitate bringing CLO 2007-1 back into compliance with all of its OC tests and as well manage the overall portfolio risk.  In addition to the $12.1 million related to the transfer of certain loans held for sale, we also recorded an other than temporary impairment charge from bond positions totaling $3.9 million. These losses were partially offset from gains on investments during the quarter totaling $9.3 million. In addition to net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $6.7 million we also recorded a net gain from derivatives and foreign exchange totaling $2.1 million and other income of $3.6 million which primarily consists of fee income from loan amendments and restructurings executed during the quarter.  The next topic I will cover is our balance sheet. At year end our credit portfolio consisted of corporate loans and bonds with an aggregate par value of $8.2 billion and an estimated fair value of $7.2 billion. As of year-end the weighted average market value of our corporate debt holdings was 87% of par as compared to 83% of par as of September 30 and 74% of par at June 30 of last year.  On our balance sheet we carry loans held for investment at amortized costs less an allowance for loan losses and loans held for sale at the lower of cost or market. Our corporate bonds are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholder’s equity. As of year-end the carrying value of our corporate debt holdings which is what our book value of $7.37 per common share reflects totaled $7.3 billion which is 89% of par value of $8.2 billion. This means that our current book value has an 11% cushion for future losses embedded in it.  Our allowance for loan losses totaled $237.3 million as of year-end as compared to $470.2 million as of September 30th. The decrease in our allowance for loan losses is attributable to $232.9 million in charge off’s we recorded during the quarter that [reduced] as either sales of loans we had previously impaired, restructuring of loan positions that had been impaired or transfers of certain previously impaired loans from held for investment to held for sale and for which the difference between our cost basis and estimated fair value of the loan was recorded as a charge off. As described in greater detail in our financial statements including our 2009 annual report on form 10-K we filed today our allowance for loan losses consist of two components; an allocated reserve and an unallocated reserve. The allocated component of our allowance for loan losses relates to specific loans we have determined to be impaired and the unallocated component relates to our entire remaining portfolio of loans held for investment.  As of year-end the allocated component of our allowance totaled $81.7 million as compared to $430.8 million as of September 30th. The unallocated component of our allowance totaled $155.6 million as of year-end as compared to $39.4 million as of September 30th.  Next we want to provide you some color on our default and recovery rates of our portfolio. To start with we are very pleased with how our portfolio credit holdings have performed over the past year. Defaults on our corporate debt portfolio declined significantly during the second half of the year. Our annualized default rate for the entire year was 6.2% as compared to the loan index default rate of 9.6% and our weighted average recovery rate based on the cost basis of our investment at 66% as compared to industry rates of 49% for leveraged loans and 23% for high yield bonds.  In addition we have witnessed significant improvement in default rates during the latter part of 2009 with an annualized default rate for the second half of 2009 of 90 basis points. Our [inaudible]defaults have totaled approximately $946 million. Of this amount Lyondell Chemical Corp., Tribune, Charter Communications, Masonite, [inaudible] have accounted for 80% of our total defaults.  Lyondell is currently trading in the low 70’s as compared to trough levels in the 20’s following their bankruptcy in January 2009. Tribune is currently trading in the low 60’s and similar to Lyondell has touched lows in the 20’s following its default. Charter is a bit different of a story as we decreased our exposure to this position based on the expectation it would default. It currently trades in the low to mid 90’s. Masonite was a position that was restructured with us receiving equity in exchange for our debt position. Currently trading levels for Masonite’s equity reflect a recovery of over 80% of our original costs.  [Inaudible] is a position we recently exited and for which the proceeds we have received from the sale combined with principle protection payments we received resulted in a recovery above par. [Here] was another position we restructured and resulted in us receiving a combination of cash, debt and equity. A recovery in this position was also above par.  The last topic I will cover is the impact of interest rates on our balance sheet. Our assets and liabilities are predominately floating rate and indexed to LIBOR. As a result our balance sheet is asset sensitive to changes in LIBOR. This is evident from the year-over-year declines in net investment income as LIBOR has declined materially since 2007. As of December 31 we are net long on LIBOR by about $1 billion. This means that a 1% increase in LIBOR translates into $10 million of incremental interest income.  Based on current LIBOR of approximately 25 basis points we don’t see much downside from today. However, we do see considerable upside. If LIBOR increases by 3% that adds $0.05 per share per quarter to our bottom line.  With that I am going to hand it back to Bill. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Thanks Mike. Twelve months ago during the first earnings call hosted by Mike and I to discuss fourth quarter 2008 results I described the four key priorities we were focused on. I want to spend a minute reflecting on these and then talk about where we are going from here.  As many of you may recall the priorities we described were first, to aggressively address KFNs near term liquidity issues, predominately from its mismatching of capital structure. Second, ensure that KFN’s capital structure protects long-term value for our shareholders in terms of our ability to leverage our low cost liability. Third, to proactively manage our business and be aggressive about it. Fourth, to continue the growth in our manager’s operating platform.  During 2009 we addressed liquidity by bringing our CLO subsidiaries back into compliance and reducing our mark to market exposure through our debt facilities by first converting our way out of CLO through a mark to market transaction to a cash flow CLO and then by paying off the debt issued by CLO 2009-1, its successor, which was our highest cost liability. We addressed our capital structure challenges by extending the maturity of our credit facility, reducing the amount outstanding under it and in addition, through the issuance of new convertible notes in January we accomplished the objective of extending our weighted average debt maturities without having to de-leverage our balance sheet any further.  Next we were able to increase the quality of our portfolio, increasing our earnings profile and work through various distress situations that have had very positive outcomes for us. Last, we continue to grow the investment capabilities of not only our credit professionals but of our entire KKR investment team. To put it simply we are very pleased with how we addressed these priorities we laid out for you and we strongly believe that we are now well positioned for the next stage in KFN’s evolution.  So what is next? Our framework for deploying capital is based upon our internal strategic asset allocation model. There are three core tenets to our asset allocation methodology which alter our capital allocation. First, provide our shareholders with an attractive total return by balancing holdings that generate solid return on cash flows and those that present opportunities for long-term capital appreciation and to share our cash profits generously with our shareholders.  Second, position our portfolio to generate attractive total returns across economic cycles. We have a bias towards addressing inflation risk today and seek to position our portfolio to perform well during periods of high inflation. We want to focus on creating a return profile and dividend paying capability which will benefit in an inflationary high rising rate environment. Based on current monetary policy we think the risk of inflation is becoming increasingly heightened over the next 3-4 years and we are positioning our portfolio to perform well whether material price inflation comes to pass or not.  Third, we want to pursue opportunities where we at KKR have a competitive advantage relative to others. We are a global firm operating with professionals and offices around the world. The combination of our global investment team and our deep relationships across many companies and industries provide us with an unparalleled ability to source unique investment opportunities across many asset classes.  Next, I will take you through some specifics of where and how we intend to deploy capital. First, our existing corporate credit portfolio. We think of these holdings as having two components. The first being the positions held through our CLO subsidiaries which represent approximately 90% of our total corporate credit and the second is the portfolio of corporate debt held outside of our CLOs.  As of December 31, the weighted average remaining reinvestment period of our CLOs was 2.6 years. During the fourth quarter alone we purchased 472 million, selling 389 million of credit for risk management and arbitrage purposes to the CLO subsidiaries. Our dual objectives for our CLOs is to increase cash flow and maximize long-term residual value consistent with regulatory requirements including limitations on trading. The market for new CLOs is beginning to appear and based on the tightening of spreads for senior CLO debt in the secondary market we think opportunities for new CLOs may become interesting at some point in the future.  That said, we don’t view our business as dependent on CLOs for growth and will only undertake new transactions where the return profile, risk, structure and liability cost makes sense versus other opportunities to deploy capital or return cash to our shareholders. Syndicated corporate debt is and will continue to be a key component of our business but it won’t be our entire business.  In addition to syndicated corporate debt we are witnessing opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital through unique and special situations which range from private debt transactions that we source to controlled distressed and mezzanine opportunities where we see the potential for attractive total returns from debt and equity components, effectively investing in the supply/demand imbalance.  The next area is private equity. Post recessionary periods have historically been among the most attractive for private equity investment. Through our industry leading role in this asset class we expect there to be a growing array of opportunities for KFN to deploy capital side by side with KKR’s private equity funds in select private equity investment opportunities. We are also seeing opportunities from KKR’s infrastructure and energy team to invest in physical assets driven by the global demand for infrastructure and dislocations in market sub-sectors like conventional production of oil and gas.  We view these opportunities as particular compelling as they both present attractive return profiles, cash on cash returns and a sound hedge against inflation. AS a firm philosophy we generally like to invest capital in [supply] demand imbalances. I do want to spend a moment sharing our thoughts on how we expect to fund future growth opportunities.  As Mike previously described we have available capital totaling about $686 million as of year-end which consists of cash and corporate credit held outside of our CLOs both of which are quite liquid. The size of our available capital reflected our desire to husband liquidity to address future debt maturities. The completion of the convertible note offering in January has given us increased flexibility to redeploy some of our available capital. Certain opportunities such as private equity will consist of us deploying capital without any incremental leverage.  On the other hand, new CLO transactions would enable us to grow our portfolio with non-recourse leverage. As we deploy capital in new opportunities we will focus on meeting two primary criteria; First, the expected returns on deployment of new capital be accretive to shareholders as measured both by cash flow and book value per share gains. Second, the market opportunities there to execute transactions at terms we find attractive and unique but with the understanding generally that market prices reflect value.  We will balance these opportunities with a strong desire to adequately compensate our shareholders with a current yield. I would like to close by thanking our investors who have been supportive during the challenging times we have had. I hope you share Mike and my enthusiasm for the future of KFN.  Thank you again for joining us on this call. Now we would welcome your questions. Operator if you could please open the line?  
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Do you have in front of you the fourth quarter net account accretion? 
Michael McFerran :  What are you looking for specifically? 
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Just the net. I guess you have the annual number. Just to net out specifically what the fourth quarter number was net of the first three quarters. 
Michael McFerran :  The fourth quarter amount was approximately $23 million. 
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co.: The two other questions are more macro. Bill you mentioned you are hedging against inflation risk but that is 3-4 years down the line. What are your bigger thoughts on where we are in the economy and unemployment, housing numbers, how have you positioned the portfolio regarding what you are thinking right now and then how the market has kind of slowed down over the last 2 months or so in terms of new issuance, etc. What is your outlook for the next three quarters on that front? 
Bill Sonneborn :  We are very cautious. One of the reasons we have pulled a lot of high yield in the fourth quarter and bought more senior secured loans relative to the high yields we sold in the context of risk management NOI portfolio is concerns about the economy. Even though it is clearly a lot better than it was and the dislocation and illiquidity that was readily apparent in the market a year ago has been somewhat fixed, there is still some challenges.  I think the reflection of our write down which is a non-cash charge in our mortgage portfolio of prime mortgages is evidence of our concern of what the next 5-6 years will reflect as the global economy needs to de-leverage. We think that will be quite a drag both on unemployment in the US and in Europe and ultimately that affects supply and demand and even though the savings rate declined today in the economy announcement we think it either has to go up substantially to deal with that de-leveraging or we have increased inflation for purposes of dealing with the leverage problem. So we are trying to position the portfolio both from a risk construction perspective to play both sides of that angle. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Hecht – JMP Securities. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: You mentioned at some point you might if the economics improved enough of new issue CLOs you might entertain pursuing those for growth. What are the structural requirements to get you involved in terms of leveraging spreads? 
Bill Sonneborn :  There is a number of features. One is you have call ability of the structure particularly in the case where you are not issuing a CLO at the top of the credit cycle where spreads are the lowest because you don’t want to have an asset being a loan which is refinanceable even though you may build a credit portfolio of LIBOR plus 500 or 450 loans if your liabilities are locked and you can’t call the structure and you get refinanced out on the asset side you can become upside down on our returns pretty quickly. So one of the aspects is the cost of the liability and the ability to call those liabilities based upon things going well and credit spreads tightening.  The second thing is in connection with any sort of CLO financing is insuring that spread, really the spread between what we can get on the assets as we deploy capital over a 1-18 month investment horizon relative to the liability costs, we feel comfortable relative to the risk. We are not there yet today even though a couple of deals have gotten done in the last couple of months. I can’t tell you when we will get there but it is something we have focused on, and model and look at very frequently. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: You provide us your top 50 holdings. Can you talk about are there any kind of on a watch list where they might have an imminent maturity or you are seeing some performance issues that you need to focus on that may drive it into default? Can you reference general stability in that group? 
Bill Sonneborn :  When we look at the top 50 holdings, page 7 of the supplemental materials, we cleaned up a lot of this over the course of the last couple of quarters. So in terms of where we are from a point of concern it is less than we have been. Some of that has been healed by companies being able to extend maturities through amendments or refinance. We talked in the context of the prepared remarks in the earnings call about #14, Tribune, and where we stand in the context of that restructuring. We still believe in Tribune having some reasonable prospects.  Going down the list, clearly our largest holding TXU which we hold predominately in the form of senior secured term loan is a business that is very focused on natural gas prices out a couple of years but it is still too early to say how that will turn out. I don’t really see anything on this list we are particularly concerned about. We talked about [inaudible], #42. We have actually exited that position at a recovery above par even though it was a defaulted investment and what we went through in terms of the concern and watch list on previous quarterly calls.  Other businesses that are on watch list remain on the watch list but their operational improvements and trends are trending the right way in terms of how they have been operating the last couple of months or quarters. So our concern, which also was evidenced in our unallocated reserve growing substantially in the quarter is by fewer companies being on our watch list or those that are on the watch list our expected losses if any being less. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: With the 2007-1 can you give a sense of how much cash is being trapped each month or how much senior securities become de-levered each month to get a sense for whatever point that does heal what kind of cash that might accrue to you guys? 
Michael McFerran :  2007-1 as we talked about interest rates the amount of cash flows we would expect to get off that deal would be highly dependent on where is LIBOR. Where LIBOR is today if all else being equal if that deal is cash flowing we expect it to generate I would say probably around $17 million a quarter or probably around $64-68 million annually. As far as how much historically is paid out of that deal, that deal started shutting down in late 2008 and beginning of 2009 it has amortized its senior bonds down by $200 million. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Including a bunch of mezz notes that KFN is majority holder of there is basically PIC interest of some of the mezz notes today that total about $57 million that will get paid off before the subordinated notes actually cash flow but KFN will get its share of that $67 million of PIC interest. 
John Hecht – JMP Securities: 2007-A now cash flow again. Can you give us a sense of what that is on a quarterly basis? 
Michael McFerran :  Just to be clear for everyone 2007-A and 2007-1 are deals where we hold 63% of the sub-notes as compared to our first three CLO’s where we own 100%. So 2007-A it is a $1.5 billion deal. Our 2/3 of it is $1 billion. Current LIBOR we think the run rate of that deal cash flow wise to us is probably about $20-22 million a year range. 
Bill Sonneborn :  What you will see in future reporting periods because we consolidate both of those CLOs and there is no minority interest accounting is you will see as those start cash flowing to subordinating note holders and pick up an interest expense which really represents the non-consolidated portion of any cash flows to the subordinated note holders. So if you see a pickup in interest expense it is really the non-KFN owned cash leaving the system. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Let me ask a few questions where I make the assumptions. Assumption and question number one, let’s assume everything is cash flowing before the end of the year. I am not worried about any one quarter’s results. I am more interested in run rate. The thing for me if all the five CLOs are cash flowing and LIBOR stays around here we would be generating cash flow to the entity of somewhere between $1.50 to $2.00 per share. Again, I am making my assumption but is it a fair assumption you will be generating something approaching $2 a share in cash flow if all five CLOs are cash flowing? 
Michael McFerran :  I think that number again based on current rates sounds a little high for us. Just to use 2009 as a proxy if all deals were cash flowing for the entire year we would have received cash flows and expenses of say $185 million. Going forward we are not putting out specifically a forecast around that really because as we rebalance the portfolio around Bill’s comments deploying capital as well as rates there are a lot of variables there that will be beneficial from a cash flow run rate. 
Bill Sonneborn :  We are thinking of spread because as we are getting pay downs and LIBOR plus 300 loans we are redeploying them into LIBOR plus 400-500 with a LIBOR floor of 2 or something like that. So you pick up that spread. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: So it could be a couple of hundred million dollars let’s say? 
Bill Sonneborn :  With everything else being the same, LIBOR 25 basis points and no incremental return on reinvested investments yes. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Number two, I heard you clearly on the dividend policy and you review quarterly, etc. Your predecessors with the collaboration of the board was paying a $2 dividend when earnings were not materially different than the run rate of earnings would be at the end of the year. Forgetting about the specific dividend and I don’t even know if I need the dividend, I am a high taxpayer like you, but basically the ability to pay dividends will be way in excess of we talk about 40% increase with $0.07 this is a company that generates sufficient cash flow that they can retain earnings and still pay $1 dividend if the board so chose. Am I reading anything wrong? I understand you want to balance the interest with…
Bill Sonneborn :  That is exactly right. It is a question of we think about capital allocation and generating returns on equity in excess of 12% of any investment of capital allocation of at least 12% on any investment we do and clearly we can increase our dividend policy if we are finding less interesting investment opportunities we can generate with a risk cushion those type of investments and dividends could and would go up under your scenario by the end of the year. It is just a question of how much they go up versus retaining the book value and we look at book value growth and cash flow in the context of distribution at the board level kind of in concert with each other. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: I want everybody to understand. I don’t think they understand. I want to make sure with my limited IQ I am looking at it right. We have an entity that could earn $1.50 to $2.00 could pay $1 dividend trading at less than $7. That is the way I look at it.  Third, the $686 million of capital available at year-end to be reinvested what is roughly that capital earning now versus what your targeted return would be? What is that $686 million throwing off to the corporation? 
Michael McFerran :  I will take the first part of that and let Bill can touch upon what our target would be. That $686 million per Bill’s comment was using redepositing liquidity. We have since 2008 and during 2009 wanting to make sure we have sufficient dry powder to be able to deal with the debt maturities prior to us [inaudible] off. So the bulk of that was leveraged loans that have of that $686 million, $100 million is cash and you are left with $586 million. That $586 million is broken out in the 10-K we filed. 
Bill Sonneborn :  The bulk of that is loans which probably had an all in coupon of 6% and the bonds probably probably had an all in around 10%. Then there is discount accretion on top of that. 
Michael McFerran :  From a cash perspective again there was a price to us holding that much liquidity. That kind of goes back to our thesis of being able to deploy that to new opportunities going forward. 
Bill Sonneborn :  If you think about how we allocate that capital now today it is principally a number of things we could do. We could basically do an on balance sheet warehousing to be ready for a new CLO when liability spreads and structures get to our target levels. Two, we can deploy that capital into opportunities on an un-leveraged basis to generate 12-15% rates of return ideally with a cash component where we get some positive skew in terms of upside and so we don’t have any symmetric return profiles solely with respect to those investments since we have enough of that elsewhere and we have gone through with the board and detailed [the] plan of to allocate that capital. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: An observation I will make and then my last question. I have others but I will go offline. Obviously with your dividend policy you could create a lot more equity for the firm by forcing the conversion of the new converts. Given our level of earnings and the prospective dividend you could afford to pay the 818 [weekly stock] well above 818 to force conversion would make it more desirable to convert or not. I know you can understand that. You can discuss everything you just discussed this afternoon that one you can figure out without any assistance.  The last thing I think you addressed but I want to kind of understand the KKR/KFN relationship. A lot of the things you are doing benefit KKR as well as benefiting KFN. You probably haven’t gone down this path but are we, KFN, and even KKR better off with KFN being part of KKR and eliminating any potential conflict of having money manager as one and that comes as a shareholder in both companies though I have to admit I own a lot more KFN than I own KKR. Have you thought about that? 
Bill Sonneborn :  I know you raised this question on the KKR earnings call last week. If you think about it KFN is really designed to be a public face of the investment capabilities of all of KKR. KKR is the manager of a bunch of [pools] of capital one of which is KFN and so it has the risks and opportunities inherent with being a manager. KFN is really representative hopefully of the ideas through our subsidiaries where we deploy capital or where we have a competitive advantage as a firm with an asset allocation framework we drive based on the collective views of people at KKR as opposed to where third parties derive that value which is in the context of the manager which is where we raise capital outside of KFN.  I hope you think of KFN as a pool of capital and KKR serves as the manager of the spring to [bare] where we see the greatest opportunity to maximize rate of return and with prudent levels of risk and proper risk management and allocating that capital in a framework we believe protects in a variety of economic times both good and bad. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: In this environment on that question I would assume this collection of assets would be able to earn 20% on your equity. Is that a fair assumption? 
Michael McFerran :  Yeah we think it should be able to do that. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors:  Backing into that it would be like $1.50 type of earning capacity. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: I have three questions all related to earnings. It looks like your related party management compensation for the third quarter was $14.6 million and it looks like it went to $8.2 million for the December quarter. I was wondering is that a sustainable drop? Is that the run rate we should be looking at on a guidance basis? 
Michael McFerran :  There are really two differences between related party management comp between the third and the fourth quarter. The first as we talked about earlier in the year in some detail when the CLOs were out of compliance with their OC tests. As a mechanism to increase liquidity for KFN we activated at KKR the management fee of those CLOs in order to effectively re[bate] those management fees as a reduction in G&A to KFN. So the trend you will see is a reduction in related party management comp but an increase in G&A. Going forward I expect that to continue. The other difference is in the third quarter if you recall we earned an incentive fee of about $4.5 million and we did not receive that for the fourth quarter. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: You are doing a great job in getting these CLOs back into compliance. Is the related party comp of $8.2 million is that a good going forward number? 
Michael McFerran :  One more time? 
Bill Sonneborn :  The related party comp of $8.2 million is that a base number going forward? 
Michael McFerran :  The way I think about it is the monthly run rate of management fees is we will say $1.3 million. So you are running around $4 million a quarter of management fees. You are running probably another $1.25 million quarterly on CLO management fees and that gets you off to I would say…
Bill Sonneborn :  Most of which other than 2005-1 gets rebated back and from the cash it doesn’t show up as GAAP to the company in terms of a means of extracting cash out of 2007-1 until we get it in compliance. 
Michael McFerran :  So now you are at about $5.5 million and you have some noise in there from stock brands which would be mark to market. So that is non-cash so I kind of back that out. Then any difference over and above that going forward is for the incentive fees. In the MD&A if you take a look we do break out for you in the discussion and in the table the components of related party management comp. You may want to look at that as a good guide for the components of this thinking about going forward. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: A quick glance at the 10-K it looks like your non-accruing loans came down by a staggering amount from $730 million to $440 million. If I am right on that which I think I am, is that loan returning to performing status or is those sales of nonperforming loans? What I am really getting at is when did that happen during the quarter and what does that mean in terms of the pickup of interest revenue going forward in say the first quarter of this year or during the year? 
Michael McFerran :  It is a mix. There were some loans we exited. A lot of it relates to we talked about taking you through the big defaults. Some of our positions have restructured so they have restructured on new pieces of paper. They are no longer on default and we don’t keep them on accrual because we are not getting interest payments. For the most part of the interesting piece about the types of holdings we have is the majority of those on non-accrual actually are still paying cash coupon but frankly because they are currently on default status we treat them as non-accrual and go to a cash basis until they are clearly out of bankruptcy proceedings our out of default.  The other thing we talked about default rates the first half of 2009 versus 2008 we actually saw kind of really that spike of defaults take place and that has abated considerably in the second half of 2009. So as you see that pipeline of deals kind of rolling off default there hasn’t been much new happening to replace it. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: But in terms of timing for most of the resolutions exit weighted towards the ends of the quarter such that fourth quarter didn’t really get that benefit and we might see that benefit in the first quarter? 
Bill Sonneborn :  There is some benefit. You can’t assume there is 100 cents on the dollar go from non-cash production to cash production. That would be an inaccurate assumption. Someone asked us if we did sell and we are not cash producing that we will now be able to deploy the cash producing assets. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: But even if they were throwing off cash but non-accrual they wouldn’t have shown up in interest income on a GAAP basis right? 
 Michael McFerran : They would have once we got the cash. It depends asset by asset if you are worried about principle recoveries you don’t book it to income. If you are worried frankly just about collecting the cash flow stream you pay a principal recovery when you get the cash payment you book it as income on a cash basis. So to Bill’s point, net/net the decline in that balance would easily have some incremental benefit to interest income but I don’t think it is going to drastically change the numbers. 
Bill Sonneborn :  On an $8 billion portfolio it is not going to matter that much even though it will help. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point:  If you could review for me again the numbers for the operating income the difference between $0.41 and the other $0.35 you mentioned and how that compares? 
Michael McFerran :  What we talked about was most of our portfolio on an average basis our holdings are carried at a discount to par. So over time you accrete that discount through that investment income to par and then when an asset prepays which has been quite frequent over the past couple of quarters with the increase in high yield activity you will see the acceleration of that discount the day the asset pays off at par.  So for the fourth quarter we actually had $10 million of interest income come from that prepayment activity which represented again the discount to par we are carrying those positions at. 
Bill Sonneborn :  We are carrying, as Mike disclosed on the call, our portfolio at $0.89 on the $1 so there is 11 points effectively of discounting. If our whole portfolio got refinanced tomorrow we would have in interest income a huge pickup of 11% of our overall portfolio. We wouldn’t call that operating because it is an acceleration of that discount so we are backing that off of from the $0.41 to the $0.35 for an apples-to-apples comparison quarter-to-quarter for future disclosure. 
Michael McFerran :  It is sort of our best attempt to give you some sort of current run rate of the business. 
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point:  What were the numbers in the third quarter? 
Michael McFerran :  I think we said on the call it was about $3 million for that same payoff amount. $2.7 million. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]. 
John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]: My question goes to the growth opportunity you had talked about earlier on the call. Could you just further articulate your thoughts on that growth opportunity in terms of investment opportunities outside of the existing CLOs and how you are thinking about funding those growth opportunities whether it be by equity or debt outside of the CLO structure? How large do you think that opportunity could be? 
Bill Sonneborn :  It depends. We are focused on the overall portfolio construction and capital allocation. So if you kind of think of the capital versus assets which is how we think about it there are a number of ways we can finance any of these deployments of capital. If we are making a selective investment in a private equity investment there is leverage asset, private equity secured by the company’s assets we are investing in so we are not going to leverage it further at KFN.  Similarly if we were deploying capital buying conventional oil and gas assets from a major that wants to devote its focus on shale plays we would have if there was any leverage it would be at the asset side secured against the research and the ground. It wouldn’t be financed on the balance sheet at KFN. So we are looking at it from a KFN equity holder’s rate of return profile and how we think about that capital allocation across the various opportunities that we have to deploy capital. I hope that answers your question. 
John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]: It does in part. I guess the second part of that would be what the size of the opportunity is, how we should think about that, whether these distressed and controlled private equity opportunities if you see them as incremental or more significant relative to the CLOs that you are investing in? 
Bill Sonneborn :  On the special situation investments that we are seeing in distressed and more proprietary debt oriented investments that have kind of rates of return in the high teens to mid 20’s, we are very selective of which one of those investments we do. So we may look at 20 investments and maybe do one but we also think the number and volume of investment opportunities and the pricing of those opportunities will continue to increase over the next 24 months if our view of the macroeconomic environment and some of the financing challenges that the market will face over that time period comes to pass.  So we are patient in terms of capital allocation there. Given we have the super majority of our capital embedded right now in the notes we hold and the context of our CLO financing structures it is not something that is going to be a revolutionary change in the context of KFN’s capital allocation but it is something we think about over time of how to best optimize rates of return relative to what the CLO market is today in terms of risk adjusted return opportunities. 
John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]: In terms of the traditional bank loan investing opportunities if you would consider thinking about investing outside of the CLO structure using more traditional TRS or other structure to get leverage? 
Bill Sonneborn :  We are not big fans of market value sources of financing. That is one of the things that got KFN in trouble and a number of finance companies into trouble with the end of this downturn was having asset duration that far exceeded your liability duration. So while we could do that it would be highly, highly selective and not something that would have any sort of material aspect in the context of our financing arrangements. We believe that our credit facility or any replacement thereof is predominately the only market based financing we will really have on a material perspective in our capital structure. 
John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]: How are you thinking about or are you thinking about the opportunity to acquire other CLO managers and could that be accretive acquisition for you? 
Michael McFerran :  Keep in mind we use CLOs in so much as KFN gets the benefit of that long-term financing as a subordinate note holder. Buying another CLO manager from KFN’s perspective doesn’t necessarily put more financing in KFN’s hands. It puts it into a management business. So it doesn’t necessarily give us that captive leverage that we hold so precious. 
Bill Sonneborn :  If we could buy the subordinated notes of the CLO and the management contract at the same time that would be interesting because then we could use the financing as a funding mechanism for assets we source through one of our subsidiaries. If we pay the right price so we are getting a rate of return similar to what we discussed which is kind of a 15-20% rate of return that could be interesting. But also understand those opportunities for the most part are priced more at least in the senior fee perspective at kind of an 8% rate of return so it wouldn’t meet our threshold. 
John Feldman – [Vance Hall Capital]: You had given in the past the weighted average market value of the loan and bond portfolio separately. I think you just gave that at 87% for Q4. Can you give that on both the loan book and the bond book? 
Michael McFerran :  It is broken out in detail for you in the 10-K. In there are schedules giving you the par of those respective portfolios as well as the market value. If you give me just a second I can try and give you the exact number. I apologize, I don’t have that in front of me and I don’t have the K in front of me but if you turn to the MD&A and the 10-K it is there for you. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment. 
Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment: Did you buy the senior convertible notes at a discount? 
Michael McFerran :  We have done a few trades. The weighted average we purchased those at is at a discount. 
Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment: Collectively? 
Michael McFerran :  Collectively. 
Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment: What are the prospects for you to renew the revolver rather than pay it down? I think specifically would markets for the spread be better today and would the terms be better especially removing the dividend restriction? 
Bill Sonneborn :  That is a good question. Clearly and you have probably seen this in the case of some similarly situated finance companies who have different restrictions like BDCs the revolver market has been there. We certainly are starting to think the revolver market may be back in the context of a business model like us. So it is something we are constantly focused on. 
Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment: Would we expect you to pay that down more? 
Bill Sonneborn :  We look at the opportunity cost of that capital between paying down our revolver and paying a dividend or making an investment with a 12-15% rate of return it is not the best use of cash because we are guessing our shareholders have a hurdle rate greater than LIBOR plus 400. 
Brian McMahon – Thornburg Investment: But the dividend restriction is kind of material and important? 
Bill Sonneborn :  The dividend restriction of 50% of estimated taxable income was put in place when that revolver was put in place about a year ago. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors. 
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: As I listened to the call which has been quite enlightening one of the things, this is a suggestion not a question, that would be helpful if you could have told your story I think the original investor here was an income oriented investor and you are now migrating into a growth and income vehicle because your dividend paying capacity is going to be dramatically in excess of the dividend you are likely to pay because of all these creative opportunities you are seeing to invest your money productively.  I think if we could kind of educate the growth investor or the total return investor to your business plan that would be helpful to the valuation and the better valuation we get the lower your cost of capital and the more wonderful things you could do. Just as a suggestion, not a question. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Excellent point Lee. 
Operator:  At this time we have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Sonneborn for any additional or closing remarks. 
Bill Sonneborn :  Thank you all for being with us over the course of the last year and listening to all the information we went through today. We look forward to getting back to work and driving shareholder value. Have a good evening. 
Operator:  This does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Laurie Poggi – Director, IR Bill Sonneborn – CEO Michael McFerran – COO
Analysts: Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co. Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point Chris Harris – Wells Fargo Securities Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors John Hecht – JMP Securities Sam Martini – ECI
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC third quarter 2009 conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following management’s prepared remarks, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laurie Poggi, Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management. Laurie, please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Good afternoon and welcome to KFN’s third quarter 2009 conference call. I'm Laurie Poggi, Director of Investor Relations for KKR Financial Holdings LLC and participating on today’s call are Bill Sonneborn, the company’s Chief Executive Officer; Michael McFerran, the company’s Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Van Horn, the company’s Chief Financial Officer. Our financial results released for the third quarter was issued today, and as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet was posted on our Web site. This call is being webcast live on our Web site and a recording will be available beginning later today through November 19. The audio webcast will be archived in the Investor Relations section of the company’s Web site as well. At this time, I’d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the SEC’s Web site at www.sec.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. And now, I’ll turn the call over to management. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the third quarter resulting from strong credit markets, active investment management, and continued progress with respect to our liquidity picture and capital structure. Net income for the quarter totaled $67.2 million or about $0.42 per diluted common share. This compared to net income for the second quarter of 2009 totaling $20.6 million or $0.14 per diluted common share, which represents a 225% sequential improvement. Our book value also increased materially during the quarter, growing by $210.5 million or $1.32 per share from $5.69 per share as of June 30, to $7.01 per share as of September 30; represents a 23% increase quarter over quarter. Clearly, a strong performance which is in large part driven by strong credit markets. The S&P/LSTA Loan Index posted returns of 10.5% for the quarter and our portfolio’s returns exceeded that benchmark. We continue to demonstrate strong alpha, which was magnified by our capital structure. As of quarter end, our corporate debt investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of 83% of par. In comparison, our portfolio was marked at 74% of par as of June 30, and 59% of par as of December 31, 2008. As for asset quality, we are pleased with the performance of the companies in which we hold investments. For the most part, the companies are performing in line with our expectation. Additionally, certain companies such as NXP and ProSiebenSat.1 Media, in which we hold large positions, have improved significantly both in terms of their respective operating performance and market pricing of their securities. Looking ahead, we are seeking to take advantage of the environment in our unique low cost, long duration liability structure to generate incremental income for the company. We are redeploying cash received from amendments, early paydowns, our scheduled maturities into higher yielding assets with extended durations to match the duration of our CLO liabilities. When redeploying capital and making investment decisions, the team continues to use the same investment process that has guided us to-date. Our investment process leverages the entire resource and intellectual base of KKR, including the industry knowledge of our colleagues in other businesses, our senior advisors, and our management team relationships both for diligence and new investment on origination opportunities. This investment process has served us well as we continue to be quite pleased with how our credits are performing favorably on a fundamental basis. We went through a difficult period of mark-to-market paying, which is driven primarily by market technicals rather than credit fundamentals in most of the companies we own and we have remained confident in the quality of the assets we continue to own. While we know challenging periods still lie ahead, our portfolio is well positioned in names we know really well and like a lot. During the past nine months, we have significantly improved our situation as a result of improved market conditions and some proactive actions taken by the team. We have moved from a position of concern over our ability to handle near-term maturities to one of being able to strategically evaluate various alternatives available to us. We will continue to focus on our 2011 and 2012 capital structure, maturities, and including insulating our balance sheet from risk, and will update our shareholders with our progress. In the meantime, our liquidity picture is positive. Unrestricted cash totaled $126 million as of September 30 and the fair value of our corporate debt investments not held in CLOs was $561.3 million as of quarter end. During the quarter, total borrowings under our senior secured credit facility decreased from $257 million to $187.5 million. When combined with the outstanding face value of our convertible notes as of September 30 of $275.8 million, we have total debt maturing prior to 2036 of $463.3 million. The cash in our balance sheet, combined with the fair value of investments not held in CLOs, was $687 million as of quarter end, which is 1.5 times our total debt balance maturing before the 2036 date. In other words, we can now withstand a substantial market decline and still satisfy our debt obligations due over the next three years. Our CLOs continued to perform ahead of expectations due to the stronger markets and proactive actions taken by the company to improve cash generation from these vehicles. During the third quarter, CLO 2005-1, CLO 2005-2, CLO 2006-1 were in compliance with their respective over collateralization tests. And as a result, we received approximately $15 million in cash proceeds from these transactions during the quarter. CLO 2007-1 and CLO 2007-A remain out of compliance with their respected subordinate overcollateralization tests. However, CLO 2007-A is now in compliance with its senior OC test. We remain focused on maximizing the value of all of our CLOs by actively managing the investments held in each one. There are several variables that will impact when these final two CLO transactions come back into full compliance. As a result, it is difficult to give a target date as to when such an event will occur. Nevertheless, we remain hopeful that in 2010, we will begin realizing at a minimum cash distributions in certain of our mezzanine tranche holdings in each of these deals, including payment of accumulated PIC interest. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to spend a moment on energy future holdings in light of its recently announced exchange transaction, our significant investment as we have disclosed in the company, and the potential for a selective default rating by S&P. Basically, companies going through these types of recapitalizations are deemed by S&P as examples of any industry to be in technical default and thus are assigned a temporary rating of SD or Selective Default for the period of the recapitalization. This SD rating is considered a downgrade for purposes of the OC test in our CLOs. As of today, CLO 2005-1, CLO 2005-2 and CLO 2006-1 are in compliance with all their respective OC tests. We hope the majority, 95%, of our investment in the term loan positions of Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, the balance of our investment is in the bonds of Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC and Energy Future Holdings. Due to a past ratings actions, we are currently marking those investments within our CLOs and our term loans to market for purposes of the overcollateralization calculation. All else being equal and based upon our calculations, if Energy Future Holdings were downgraded to selective defaults, resulting in the treatment as a defaulted loan for our CLO OC test and the SD with an effect on their respective determination dates for those CLOs, we believe these structures would remain fully in compliance with all their respective OC tests. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
Michael McFerran: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon. As Bill summarized, net income for the quarter was $67.2 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. Our operating income for the quarter, reflecting net investment income of $72.7 million less non-investment expenses of $18.5 million, was $54.2 million or $0.35 per diluted common share. The $13 million difference between our operating income at $54.2 million and net income of $67.2 million was due to the $13 million difference of other income. The key components of the $13 million are as follows. We had realized and unrealized gains from our derivative positions totaling $19.9 million. Approximately $19 million of this relates to mark-to-market gains on loan positions held to total rate of return swaps, largest contributors being certain positions in US Food Service and PagesJaunes. We had realized and unrealized gains on investments totaling $21.2 million. This gain was primarily attributable to $24.2 million of mark-to-market gains, our equity investment in Masonite which is out of fair value. This gain was slightly offset by losses on sales of other investments during the quarter. We had $17.7 million of realized and unrealized losses in our mortgage investments, of which $15.9 million relates to mark-to-market losses. The losses of $1 million in short positions during the quarter and other income of $1.2 million, which primarily consists of fee income that we recognized during the quarter. Last, we had $10.6 million in losses on restructuring and extinguishment of debt. This amount consists of a $14.4 million net loss recognized from the termination of CLO 2009-1, which was offset by $3.8 million gain from the repurchase of $5 million of our outstanding trust preferred securities of $1.2 million. Our net interest margin for the quarter was 3.24% as compared to 2.44% for the second quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower cost of funding due to the retirement of the CLO 2009-1 senior notes and a modest increase in the asset yield of our portfolio. We recorded no incremental provision for loan losses during the quarter. The increase in book value per share reflects net income of $67.2 million or $0.42 per share, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income totaling $141 million or $0.89 per common share, and share based comp of $2.4 million or $0.01 per common share. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income reflects appreciation in the value of our high-yield bond portfolio of $148.4 million or $0.94 per share, which was offset by decline in value of two interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges under GAAP of $7.4 million or $0.05 per common share. As Bill already highlighted, our portfolio has benefited from the continued rally in credit prices. As of quarter end, we had corporate investments with an aggregate par balance of $8.5 billion and an estimated fair value of $7.1 billion. In comparison, our portfolio had a total par balance of $8.6 billion and estimated fair value of $6.4 billion as of June 30. The carrying value of our corporate loans and bonds net of our allowance for loan losses was $7.5 billion or 87% of face value of these investments at quarter end. Included within this is the allowance for our loan losses, which was $470.2 million and represents a reserve totaling 7% of the amortized cost basis of our loans held for investment. Next, I will cover the liability section of the balance sheet. As of September 30, the weighted average cost of financing the senior notes issued by our CLOs is LIBOR plus 53 basis points. Our debt outside of our non-recourse CLO transactions consists of our senior secured credit facility, convertible notes, and trust preferred securities. The weighted average cost of funding of our holding company debt was 5.74% as of quarter end. Our holding company debt totaled $747 million as of quarter end, of which 58% is fixed rate. Also, we have terminated the $100 million standby facility with our manager. As we have made no borrowings under this facility, and due to its high cost of funding at LIBOR plus 15% and in consideration of our strong liquidity situation, we have determined that it was advantageous to terminate the agreement and avoid future obligations to fund the 50 basis points facility pre-required by the agreement. I want to spend just a moment on interest rate sensitivity for our portfolio. We are asset sensitive and fluctuations on LIBOR can have a significant impact on our earnings. With LIBOR sitting under 30 basis points, we have felt the impact of historically low interest rates on our assets and cash flows. That said, we are clearly at the bottom from a rate standpoint and future increases in LIBOR will materially benefit our earnings and cash flow. To highlight this, I would expect to see some volatility in earnings once we begin to see an appreciation in rates. With that, I am going to hand this back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Mike. We remain focused on some key points and those key points are consistent with some of the things we have talked about in prior quarters. First and foremost, we are actively managing our portfolio with a long-term credit fundamental perspective. This includes harvesting the value of the low-cost financing provided by our financing structure by recycling proceeds from asset sales, principle paydowns or amendments into higher yielding positions with longer duration. Generating attractive risk-adjusted returns will remain core to our principle to the value investor. Next, we remain focused on our capital structure and liquidity profile. While we have made significant progress in our liquidity outlook during the past nine months, we continue to focus our attention on addressing upcoming maturities. Finally, we continue to build out and grow our world-class platform of investment and operational professionals, and I am proud of all they accomplished during the quarter. We believe that the strength and depth of our team continues to provide us with a unique competitive advantage. We are pleased with the results in the past quarter, most importantly, the continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity profile and look forward to providing you updates on progress and news as it is made. Thank you again for joining us on this call. Now, we would welcome the questions. Operator, can you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will go first to Gabe Poggi with FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co: Hi, good afternoon guys, great quarter. Two quick questions, and I am sure you will be getting questions on this afterwards, I don’t know if you guys mentioned or not or if you can mention, looking through the supplementals, the CLO-7-A looks to be real close to compliance. Can you comment on kind of where we are as of today relative to September 30? And then two, the question is – the second question is just thoughts on dividend going forward, this is a great quarter, and I know Mike you said there is going to be some volatility, but this is a big earnings number and just what your guys thought process is after posting such a big number? Thanks.
Michael McFerran: Sure. Gabe, CLO 2007-A, we can’t comment how it has performed. Since quarter-end, I don't think it has changed materially, as nothing significant has happened that we are aware of in the portfolio in the last few weeks. As to your point, it's capacity in the senior test, subordinate test is at a reasonable deficit. The prior remarks were hopeful that some of the mezz tranches are now more on a compliance in 2010. But as you know, there is still a lot of variables that can make that happen sooner or extend that out to a later date.
Bill Sonneborn: Just following on that, we are focused on that. The subordinated OC test, which is the one way that subordinated free cash flow restructure would begin accruing to the manager, we are about $58 million so of the end of the quarter short with respect to that test, which is about 3.5 points to 4 points of overcollateralization. That is within reach with good market environments and some opportunities with investment perspective to redeploy capital. And your second question with respect to dividend, it is as we have talked about in the last quarter. There remains an absolute key objective of the management team which is to deliver liquidity profile where we can recommend or have a discussion with the Board on that subject. That is a Board level decision and that is all we can say on that question at this point Gabe.
Gabe Poggi – FBR Capital Markets & Co: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: We will hear next from Robert Schwartzberg with Compass Point.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Hi, two questions, one do you have an update on non-accruing loans for the September quarter relative to the June quarter? And perhaps to cover this, but given that you might be receiving cash from CLOs in 2010, what is your outlook on reinstituting a dividend?
Michael McFerran: I will take the first question, Robbie. It is non-accrual loans, in the 10-Q we filed earlier today, in the footnotes of the loans, I believe it is note 5, we actually break out the non-accrual amount. From a dollar perspective, I don’t think it has materially changed since the last quarter, may have improved slightly. Dividend, Bill?
Bill Sonneborn: And then the dividend question, it is the same. That remains the key objective, it is one of the key objectives that we have laid out as a team to deliver dividend to our shareholders, and the Board is clearly focused on that, but I can't really go into more detail on that this time.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: If I could have one follow-up question, do you have any involvement with the Tribune and has that changed now that the Cubs have been sold or does that affect any investment you might have there?
Bill Sonneborn: As we have disclosed in the supplement materials, we do have a position in Tribune. Tribune remains in bankruptcy. It has sold the Cubs through a bankruptcy process itself. We continue to believe that Tribune represents an interesting investment a bit relative to its current market price today.
Robert Schwartzberg – Compass Point: Great, thanks a lot, great quarter.
Operator: Moving on to Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Harris – Wells Fargo Securities: Great, thanks for taking my questions. First off, relating to book value, I think you guys had a pretty large sequential increase there two quarters in a row and I know you attributed part of that to appreciation in your high yield bond portfolio. How large is that portfolio as of September 30?
Bill Sonneborn: If you go into our supplemental materials on page 6, you will see a pie chart that shows the investment portfolio composition. Effectively, in our investment portfolio, 86% of our portfolio in aggregate is loans, 10% of our portfolio is in the form of high-yield bonds, which has an estimated fair value of $736 million as of September 30 quarter end.
Chris Harris – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about how a rise in LIBOR rates potentially had a positive impact in your earnings. So, I am just curious if you could maybe expand a little bit on that. If your liabilities are floating rate too and you are match funded, I am not clear how you would have a huge benefit to earnings and maybe you can talk a little bit about that.
Bill Sonneborn: Sure. The benefit is that, if you kind of break apart KFN, it holds mezzanine notes within our CLOs which are LIBOR plus spread coupon paying securities and it has a subordinated note which is effectively the equity in the structure. So, the equity if you will, the mezz and the equity which is really the underlying asset that KFN at the holding company owns, that is highly LIBOR sensitive because that's why [ph] the assets are LIBOR sensitive relative to the liabilities the equity is not and really LIBOR will drive a lot of the cash flow.
Chris Harris – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Great, thanks guys.
Operator: We will hear next from Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Yes, thank you.
Bill Sonneborn: Hi Lee, how are you?
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Good. It sounds like you are happy to hear my voice. I guess I have five or six questions. First, I congratulate you; you have done a terrific job, you and your team since the change in management. Obviously markets have helped, but you take the credit because the markets would have to sell you to take the debit. You have heard the questions on the dividend and I have heard your response, and I guess I would ask, is the management – let me try to finesse this question to get you to say something, is the management going to recommend to the Board the payment of a dividend? We have Board decisions, but what is the management’s view?
Bill Sonneborn: I just reiterate, Lee, it is – for us to fulfill the plan we laid out for shareholders at the beginning of this year, that is a key objective, that is one that is left to be done.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Okay.
Bill Sonneborn: On our list of To Dos.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Let me ask you – I am going to try to get around, when is the next Board meeting that the dividend would be considered?
Bill Sonneborn: We have frequent Board meetings.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Okay. And I would appreciate your pointing out to the Board that in your Web site that you talk about cost tax efficiency, and right now we are in an extremely inefficient tax structure because you guys are doing a terrific job generating income, but your poor shareholders are not getting any of that income to pay their taxes. So, I won’t beat this one to death; I will move on to a few other questions, but I think that your shareholders want income, and I think given our tax structure, they deserve it. All of your cross-held KKR CLOs within other CLOs marked for OC purposes are between $0.00 and $0.25 to the dollar, and this is definitely not the marks for those tranches. Can you explain where these marks come from and what has to happen to raise these marks?
Bill Sonneborn: Any of those situations are marked by broker quotes because they are discounted obligations within the structures. And so, for purposes overcollateralization, they are not held at par but at market and market is derived from underlying third-party broker quotes.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Okay, got you. And at the end of the second quarter, you said that you had $50 million more in cash than all maturing liabilities over the next three years. If you cast as a statement in the same context, what would that $50 million number be now?
Bill Sonneborn: When we discussed basically those liabilities, we have coverage of 1.5 times between loans, bonds, and cash, the amount of the remaining credit facility that we have of $187.5 million plus the $278 million of converts left outstanding
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: But were you not including liabilities beyond the next three years into the calculation?
Bill Sonneborn: We were just focusing on any liabilities that are due before 2036. So, the convert and the credit facility, but excluding the TruPS, we just still have quite a bit of time before their ultimate maturity date.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: I am assuming, maybe this is a rough guess and you can help me here. Of the three CLOs that are in compliance, just throwing rough, is it close to $60 million?
Michael McFerran: I would say thereabout, or again, reflective on rates, Lee, that would clearly go up.
Bill Sonneborn: If you annualize the quarter, it's $60 million.
Michael McFerran: Yes, we did $15 million on three CLOs this quarter.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: Right. So, basically again not beating a dead horse on the dividend, we are generating $16 million of recurring income before the other two CLOs come into compliance.
Michael McFerran: That is correct.
Bill Sonneborn: That is correct.
Lee Cooperman – Omega Advisors: And given the liquidity nature of the portfolio, I think it is just a matter of time before we see a dividend. But I won’t go there again, I mean common sense would suggest, given the way this vehicle was sold to the public, given the wonderful job your management team has done in fixing it up, I assume sometime between now and the end of the year, we will hear about a dividend. But congratulations, I have got lots of other questions, but I got to do those offline, but you have done a very fine job and to be congratulated.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Lee.
Operator: We will hear now from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and forgive me if I ask something you went into detail on the call, I am juggling a couple of earnings calls at this time.
Bill Sonneborn: I understand, John.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: First is, just wondering on your thoughts on expectations for maybe the new issued CLO market to open. We have seen the credit markets move positively. Is there any possibility that we are able to see new issuance of the CLOs in any time in the future?
Bill Sonneborn: You know, it is kind of interesting, it is natural as credit spreads kind of tighten, it is interesting that all of a sudden the ability to obtain leverage to invest in credit spreads becomes available. And so, I can’t predict when and if cash flow CLOs will become a thing of the future. But certainly, there are structures similar to CLOs that are available in the market today, most of which have market triggers as opposed to more cash flow profile in terms of their structures. But at least, if that is evidence that the market is starting to reemerge, you can say that it is starting to reemerge. But in terms of forward looking, whether the market comes back and certainly whether it comes back to the full force and effect, it was in the mid to end of 2007, it is still undetermined.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. And with respect to the $15 million of cash flow that you are generating right now, can you remind me what it was last quarter on a quarterly basis, just to get a sense for trajectory here?
Michael McFerran: John, just to be clear, the $15 million is in our total cash flow. We highlighted that those three CLOs all in compliance during the quarter we received the cash payments on our notes in them, which in aggregate were $15 million. But the business has clearly generated more than $15 million in cash.
Bill Sonneborn: Because outside of the CLOs, we own a bunch of loans, bonds, and mortgages which throw off substantial interest income.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Yes, I understand that. So to clarify just the $15 million in cash distributions from the CLOs.
Bill Sonneborn: We use the basic math, John. We said last quarter on a pro forma basis, after reflecting the paydown of 09-1 and receiving some cash out of that vehicle and reducing our senior credit facility from $256 million to $200 million, we had pro forma cash of $68 million. We have come out today saying we have $125 million. That is our net-net cash increase during the quarter.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay, thank you very much. And then the last question is, clarification or maybe I just looked at this incorrectly, but the credit markets were strong, generally speaking the mortgage markets were strong during the quarter as well in terms of looking at the value of the securities. Yet, you took a $17.7 million loss in that category this quarter. Can you just explain what happened there?
Bill Sonneborn: It's just in the fair value of our mortgage portfolio when we decided to make those fair value determinations, we have continued to see in our ’05 particular vintage mortgage-backed securities, it is only less than $200 million market value portfolio net to KFN. We saw increasing delinquency statistics, and even though spreads generally have tightened for all assets including mortgage securities. We are also seeing higher prepayments which in our mortgage portfolio in terms of the mortgage trusts, we own some IO strips. And so, the result of the higher prepayment has squeezed the value of the IO strips, so the combination of that we took a fair market value adjustment in our mortgage portfolio.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay great, thanks for the clarification. Thanks very much.
Operator: Moving next to Sam Martini with ECI.
Sam Martini – ECI: Hi guys, good afternoon, how are you?
Bill Sonneborn: Hi, Sam.
Sam Martini – ECI: Just two questions, back to the gentlemen performing – what do you think the positive carry on the loans and bonds outside of the CLOs versus your liabilities is? What is the – the $15 million a quarter is aside and that will be CLOs 05-1, 05-2 and 06-1, and forget about 07-1 and 07-A, but what do you think the ex-CLO asset liability kicks off annually and in cash, I know a lot of that is fixed and some of it is floating, but do you have a rough estimate?
Michael McFerran: Yes, some of it – I mean, a lot of it is floating on both the liability and the asset sides. I am just going to give you a net number and walk you forward from kind of some past remarks. We used to say, if all the CLOs shut down, we generate enough cash to pay off our debt, I mean to service all of our debt and pay all of our expenses.
Bill Sonneborn: And all of our operating expenses and service all of our debt expenses.
Michael McFerran:
 :
Bill Sonneborn: Exactly.
Michael McFerran: Now, with LIBOR where it is, it's clearly had a negative effect. We have counteracted that by unwinding the assets in 2009. One, it has obviously increased our assets on balance sheet. We are comfortable today that we are generating outside the CLOs, I would say probably at least $15 million to $20 million annually. Again, we are going to emphasize if rates go up.
Sam Martini – ECI: That is net?
Michael McFerran: That is net, right.
Sam Martini – ECI: Okay. Just a question, I have not seen the supplemental, last part of the first question, I have not seen the new supplement, but a lot of these bonds from – the Odessa bonds, the Laureate bonds, the Accellent bonds are up meaningfully pretty close to par. You are still getting positive carry on these things relative to where your revolver is in your 7%. What is sort of the vision on how we are going to trade this sort of ex-CLO portfolio as they approach par and get to points where Laureate at 11.75% [ph] are still probably okay. But at par, are we still going to hold them or we just going to clip a coupon or are we going to try to swap into something else?
Bill Sonneborn: We constantly actively manage that portfolio, Sam. So, we don’t just sit there with a static pool outside of the CLOs in the context of investments. We are optimizing return relative to risk and the cost of capital and ROI target to our shareholders.
Sam Martini – ECI: The only reason I ask is, and maybe you could help me with this math, is that I look at sections in slide 13 and 07-A were $58 million out of compliance. And if I assume that we've got about $1.5 billion of collateral, with about $1.3 billion of notes, and I assume that we are getting something like 4 [ph] on the collateral and paying 2-ish on the notes, that is about $40 million in net ignoring all the servicing fees. So, we could pay $58 million in cash to cure that and receive $40 million immediately year one with another couple of years reinvestment period and immediately cash flow. And I think that thing will cure, but how do you think about just curing this vehicle with $60 million with an immediate – I don’t even know what the IRR is, it would be so high. Am I thinking about it the right way?
Bill Sonneborn: Sam, the option is to take $58 million, write the check, put it in the vehicle, and bring it into compliance. Yes, the risk you run with that is once you put that in, you are not assured to get it back out, if you have an asset default or an asset downgrade, if loan prices go south, then you find yourself out of compliance and $60 million left in liquidity.
Sam Martini – ECI: But, am I thinking about the numbers reasonably, that if this were cured, it would –
Bill Sonneborn: You could put it in or you could effectively delever within the structure through selling defaults that are credit risk securities, there is a lot of ways to get there.
Sam Martini – ECI: Roughly, is the 4% on $1.5 billion and 2% on the $1.3 billion of notes getting me to about $40 million of net interest to the equity, is that about right?
Bill Sonneborn: It sounds about right. I mean, I think the cash coupon is going to be south of that. The yield is north of 4% based on when we bought the assets. The actual cost of funding on the senior notes for that deal was lower, about 87 I think.
Sam Martini – ECI: So, really to your point, you could put in $60 million, run the risk of not getting it back, but in theory, if you could think you would be cured for a year, you would almost get your whole thing back priced as an IO and any principal you got back above that.
Bill Sonneborn: You can be assured, there are two things.
Michael McFerran: You have that issue which of course, we've talked with you before. We have always looked at that as a way of deploying capital, if it has a high ROI and that is certainly something we could do. We also have to balance out conflicts of interest with other holders of 2007-A, which is also a relevant consideration.
Sam Martini – ECI: So, the positive carry of the non-CLOs is $20 million. We are getting $60 million from the existing CLOs and if we cured this, we would get about another $40 million.
Bill Sonneborn: Within reason.
Sam Martini – ECI: Thanks guys.
Operator: And at this time, I would like to turn things back to Bill Sonneborn for closing remarks.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you all for your attention and for the questions. We appreciate it and we are going to get back to work and continue to try to, as a team, focus on improving the business. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Laurie Poggi - IR Bill Sonneborn - CEO, President Mike McFerran - CFOfficer
Analysts: Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC second quarter 2009 conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation of the conference we will open the conference up for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Laurie Poggi, Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Thanks, Sony. Good afternoon and welcome to KFN’s second quarter 2009 conference call. I'm Laurie Poggi, Director of Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management and participating on today’s call are Bill Sonneborn, the company’s Chief Executive Officer; Michael McFerran, the company’s Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Van Horn, the company’s Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Sossen, the company’s General Counsel. Our financial results released for the second quarter was issued today and as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet was posted on our website. Today’s call is being webcast live on our website and a recording will be available beginning later today through August 20. The audio webcast will be archived in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website as well. At this time, I’d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. And now, I’ll turn the call over to management. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you, Laurie and good afternoon. Our team accomplished a great deal during the quarter. We made progress on liquidity issues around KFN's capital structure, the goal we've discussed in the last several calls. These steps and others on which we are focused will help maximize the value of our assets over the long-term. First, as indicated in our earnings release today, we successfully amended our credit facility to both extend its maturity date by one year and provide additional flexibility to the company. Second, as previously disclosed, we took specific actions to enhance the over-collateralization on three of our cash flow CLOs, which improved the opportunity for KFN to generate cash flow and permit more flexibility in continuing to maintain our low cost LIBOR plus 33 basis point term financing in this new credit spread environment on those structures. Finally, we have paid down the senior debt in CLO 2009-1, our most expensive structured finance debt, and have freed-up the remaining loan collateral in that CLO for purposes of cash flow and corporate flexibility.  Excluding our CLO notes, mortgages and private equity and other assets, we now have cash and a market value of loans and bonds with a cushion compared to face amount of debt maturing between now and 2036. A number of these accomplishments were significantly assisted by the strong credit performance during the quarter, as well as year-to-date, the market value of our corporate debt portfolio has appreciated 26% year-to-date through June 30 and 33% year-to-date through July 31. As of July 31, our corporate debt portfolio including our bond positions had a weighted average market value of approximately 78% of par. I note that under a GAAP our loan portfolio is carried at amortized costs, less than allowance for loan losses. During the quarter, we generated operating income of $0.33 per share that figure differed from our reported EPS of $0.14 by a series of items, which Mike will describe in detail later on in this call. So before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to expand upon these three key milestones the company accomplished during the quarter. First, the details on our amended senior secured credit facility. Prior to this amendment, we had a 300 million facility that was due to step-down to a 150 million in November of this year. We have amended that facility to reflect the following: one, the size of the facility was reduced to 200 million. As of June 30, we had 257 million in borrowings outstanding and have paid this amount down to the 200 million facility size. Second, the final maturity of the facility is extended to November 2011 from November 2010. Third, the facility reduces in size by 12.5 million on each of September 30, 2009 and each subsequent quarter until June 30, 2010. This results in a 150 million facility size as of June 30, 2010 through the maturity of the facility as opposed to a step down to a 150 million in November of this year. This is an asset-backed borrowing based facility according to the amount of actual borrowings outstanding will be determined by the market value of the assets pledged to the facility. As of today, the company's available collateral supports the ability to have default 200 million drawn under this facility. The cost of funding for this facility increased from LIBOR plus three to LIBOR plus 4% and we paid the lenders 4.5 million in fees in relation to this amendment. The amendment allows us now to issue second-lien debt or as we are restricted from doing so, prior to this amendment.  The amendment reduces our adjustable tangible net worth covenant to 700 million from one billion to provide additional flexibility given the GAAP recording of amortized costs. Also under the amendment we are able to use up to 50 million of unrestricted cash to repurchase convertible notes or trust-preferred securities, whereas we were unable to use cash to do so prior to the amendment. Finally, in addition to these terms, the amended credit facility provides the ability to pay annual dividends up to 50% of estimated annual taxable income. As of today, based on both the market value of assets collateralizing the credit facility and the advanced rates applied to those market values we have approximately 250 million of collateral support based on underlying advance rates within this facility, against the 200 million outstanding.  Extending the duration of this facility has provided us with increased flexibility to address the maturity dates of our borrowings. We consider this an important step in improving KFN’s overall capital structure. Now, let’s move on to the important action that we took in relation to our cash flow CLOs. Specifically, CLO 2005-1, CLO 2005-2 and CLO 2006-1 for which we hold 100% of the subordinated notes, or more simply the equity in these vehicles. As we've described on previous calls the primary source of the company’s liquidity challenges has been due to non-compliance of our CLOs with their irrespective over-collateralization or OC tests. As described in detail in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q filed today and previously, when the CLO is out of compliance with its OC tests the cash flows that would normally be received by the mezzanine and subordinated noteholders is used to amortize the principal amount of the most senior class of notes issued by that CLO. During the latter part of 2008, certain of our CLOs began failing their respective OC tests. Due to ratings agency downgrade, the material asset price declined.  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the company took the action of surrendering for cancellation at total of 298 million of mezzanine and junior notes issued by CLO 2005-1, CLO 2005-2 and CLO 2006-1 Page 13 of the supplemental presentation shows the results of our OC tests based on the June monthly reports for our CLOs prior to this action, and Page 14 of the presentation shows the results of our OC tests from the July monthly reports, which reflect this action. As the company holds all of the subordinated notes in these CLOs the company and shareholders still have all the upside in these deals as the CLOs have simply removed debt from their respective capital structures and all residual benefits and cash flow of the deal still flow to the company. The cancellation of these notes brought the OC test into compliance, as the result has materially improved the cash flow outlook for KFN. Finally, the action we took for 2009-1, our cash flow CLO which replaced our market value CLO was out of funding LLC earlier this year. CLO 2009-1 was a triple amortizing structure, such that all principal and interest from the assets in CLO 2009-1 were to be used to pay-off the senior debt prior to the company receiving any cash distribution from its structure. As a result, we did not expect to receive any cash flows in CLO 2009-1 for at least the next two plus years. The rally in loan prices over the past quarter provide us the opportunity to sell higher priced investments held in that structure to generate sufficient cash within the vehicle to pay-off its outstanding senior debt, which was the most expensive financing of any of our structured financing vehicle. We were able to sell 423.1 million of corporate debt investments at a weighted average price of 88% on par. The assets we sold had a cash yield of 3.9% as compared with the interest rate on the senior debt within the structure of LIBOR plus 4.25. On July 24, we retired the senior notes issued by CLO 2009-1 and subsequently distributed to an affiliate [rolled at] 20% interest in the subordinated notes issued by that structure, its pro rata interest in the residual assets. The net result of this transaction is that KFN now owns the residual assets of CLO 2009-1, which consists of corporate debt investments with the par value of 317.4 million at an estimated fair value of 242.4 million as of June 30, 2009 as well as cash and receivables totaling 14.9 million. KFN will receive the interest coupon payments on these assets which we currently estimate to be approximately 11.5 million per year. Subject to a variety of risks as we have both noted in our public filings in previous calls, we expect the CLO modifications and the pay down of senior notes within 2009-1 will generate approximately 60 to 70 million of cash flow to KFN on a run rate basis. In addition to these actions, I also want you to – want to provide you with an update on our total rate of returns swaps. We currently have approximately 33.5 million of net debt related to loans with an estimated fair value of 59.2 million that are financed on total rate of return swap. During our last earnings call, we highlighted that most of these swaps were scheduled to mature during the fourth quarter of 2009. Since that call, we have successfully extended the terms of those swaps; and as of today, we have no swaps maturing prior to June 2010. Next, I want to summarize where KFN's balance sheet stands as of today. On the pro forma basis, have adjust our June 30 balances for the pay down of our senior secured credit facility to 200 million and a deleveraging of 2009-1. Our balance sheet would reflect net cash of 68.2 million and total corporate investments held on balance sheet outside of our CLOs with a par amount of 862.8 million and an estimated fair value of 456.7 million. In comparison, our debt that is maturing over the next three years consists of the 200 million secured credit facility and 275.8 million of convertible notes. Accordingly, excluding our mortgages, investments held through swap all of our private equity investments and all of our CLO interest, the combined value of our corporate debt investments and unrestricted cash up $525 million is approximately 50 million in excess of our debt that will mature over the next several years. Simply put, we now have cash and on balance sheet loans and bonds with the market value in excess of the total amount of debt under our credit facility in remaining senior convertible notes. Additionally, let’s spend a moment on our book value, loss provisions and outlook. As of June 30, the carrying value of our corporate debt investments was 86% of par; this means that our current book value of $5.69 per share as of June 30 reflects the loss rate of 14% of our investments in corporate debt. Based on our current expectations, we believe that the carrying value of our corporate debt investments is appropriate and while improved market conditions could result in our portfolio performing better than this. We have taken loan loss provisions and bond impairments during the past several quarters that reflect the current challenging economic environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike?
Mike McFerran: Thanks, Bill and good afternoon. We reported net income for the quarter of 20.6 million or $0.14 per diluted common share. Our operating income for the quarter reflecting net investment income before provision for loan losses totaled 67.5 million less non-investments expenses of 17.4 million, total operating income was 50.1 million or $0.33 per share. The $29.5 million difference between our operating income of 50.1 million and net income of 20.6 million, this is the several one-off items that I'll walk you through.  First, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $12.8 million, which were netted against charge-offs to our allowance for loan losses during the quarter of 47.4 million resulted in an ending allowance for loan loss balance of $473.2 million as of June 30. Next, we have realized and unrealized gains on derivatives and foreign exchange of 26.5 million, this amount primarily consisted of mark-to-market gains on loans financed the total rate of return swaps and gain from single name credit default swaps where we are allowing certain credits. We also had realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling 46.6 million during the quarter. The largest component of this was 27.2 million and losses recognized from the disposition of 423.1 million par amount of investment sold as part of deleveraging CLO 2009-1. We also recorded an impairment charges on two bond investments totaling 6.2 million. As we have previous reported, we recorded material impartment charges for several bond positions over the past several quarters, particular at year end 2008. During the second quarter these positions experienced significant material price appreciation, and as reflected in our other comprehensive income on our balance sheet as of June 30, the aggregate market value of our bond positioned that have been impaired have a market value now or as of June 30 was a 66 million higher than the market value of these bond positions were previously written down to. This gain would flow through income upon realization. In addition of these items, we also had realized and unrealized losses on our residential mortgage-backed securities investments totaling 7.4 million. Gains from certain short positions totaling 2.5 million and gains from exchanges of convertible notes for common shares is 6.9 million. During the quarter, we executed two separate exchanges through which the company issued approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock and exchange for 15.7 million face amounts of convertible notes. Next, I’m going to review our balance sheet as of quarter end. At June 30, our unrestricted cash balance totaled 114.4 million when adjusted to pay down for when adjusted for the pay down of our senior secured credit facility to 200 million and the related fees and receipt of residual assets, specifically cash from 2009-1 upon its deleveraging. Our pro forma June 30, cash balance would be 68 million. As described in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q filed today, we held corporate loans and bonds outside of our CLOs excluding loans held (inaudible) return swaps for the total par value of 545.4 million and an estimated market value of 214.3 million.  As Bill previously described, when adjusted reflect the residual assets we now hold from the deleveraging of CLO 2009-1 the total par and estimated fair value of our investments held on balance sheet is 862.8 of par with a fair value of 456.7 million. As of June 30, our loan portfolio was carried on our balance sheet at 88% of par value and our bond portfolio was carried at 68% of par value and when combined our total corporate debt investment portfolio is carried to 86% of par value. Next, I’ll cover the liability section of our balance sheet. As of June 30, the weighted average cost of financing of the senior notes issued or as CLOs was LIBOR plus 86 basis points. On a pro forma basis excluding the senior notes issued by 2009-1 that were retired subsequent to quarter end, the weighted average cost of financing of the senior notes issued by our CLOs was LIBOR plus 52 basis points. The CLO note to affiliates line items in our balance sheet reflects the minority interest of the mezzanine and subordinated tranches issued by CLO 2007-1, 2007-8 and CLO 2009-1 which are held by an affiliate.  Other than our CLOs, our debt consists of our senior secured credit facility, which has been paid down to 200 million subsequent to quarter end. Our convertible notes through July 2012, the outstanding balance of 275.8 million and our 30 year trust preferred securities totaling 288.7 million. Before handing this back to Bill, I will spend a minute on our liquidity outlook. Last quarter, we indicated that we expect to generate sufficient cash flows from our investments held outside of CLOs to meet our expense obligations. We believe that the actions taken this quarter, specifically the deleveraging of 2009-1 and the cancellation of debt issued by 2005-1, CLO 2005-2 and CLO 2006-1 improves the company’s cash flow outlook by 60 to $70 million, annually. And I do want to highlight that this estimate is based on several assumptions it could be impacted by changes in market conditions. Most notably, changes in LIBOR can affect the cash flows we receive, as well as defaults, decline in asset prices and rating agency downgrades could cause each of the three CLOs that we brought into compliance 2005-1, 2005-2 and 2006-1 to fall out of compliance with the respective over-collateralization tests. Similarly, defaults of investments held outside of our CLOs could negatively impact our cash flow.  With that, I’m going to hand it back to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Mike. Since December 2008, we have specified that our immediate priority was to address the company's near-term liquidity, cash flow and debt refinancing issues. We believe that those actions we have taken over the past few months have accomplished that objective. A great deal was taken place during the last quarter and a lot of information has been shared on this call. But I want to summarize what it means to our shareholders. We have taken actions to extend the maturity profile of our debt to a manageable schedule and create the potential for an increase in our forecasted cash flows by 60 to 70 million annually and we increased our asset holdings out of CLOs, such that when combined with cash we currently have, total cash and market value of corporate debt investments are 50 million in excess of our debt and will mature over the next three years. This question is before we include our other holdings, including mortgages, private equity investments, and loans held through total rate of return swaps.  Looking ahead, we are focused on several key topics. First and foremost, we recognized the importance of resuming dividends to our shareholders, and therefore focused on cash flow maximization without value destruction. At this point it is too early to predict whether the Board will decide to make a dividend payment in 2009. However, we all remain focused on creating ability for KFN to return a portion of its profits to shareholders. Next, we continue to concentrate on addressing our long-term debt maturities, which consists of our amended credit facility in our convertible notes maturing in 2012. In addition to these items, value creation is a constant objective as we manage our investment portfolio and seek opportunities to identify accretive incremental investments with quite attractive risk return profiles. The current environment will continue to present interesting investment ideas, through which the low-weighted average cost of funding that our CLO structures provide will enable us to participate with low cost modest leverage.  Our CLOs provided the opportunity for great returns over the next several years, this is to illustrate the yield on the average leverage loan today is somewhere around seven to 8% over LIBOR. If you apply that to the average cost of funding from our CLOs of 52 basis points over LIBOR and with three times leverage now that we preserve the senior low cost financing within our structures, we generate a levered return in the mid 20s. This is the simplest way to understand the long-term value of our CLOs. Our CLOs have weighted average investment periods that will continue for at least the next three years.  We thank you again for joining us on the call. Now we would like to open it up to questions. Operator, can you please open up the line.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from [Lee Cooperman] of Omega Advisors.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Thank you. You’ve given a lot of information, which I’m very appreciative for. But, frankly, maybe it’s my average IQ. Can you give some help interpreting the significance of the information and your intentions? And with your permission, what I'd like to do is I have a half a dozen question, but I don’t want to monopolies the call. So, I would like to tell you my questions, I suspect that of interest to everybody on the call. And you take them in any way you want or you can have me come back in the queue, et cetera. So assuming you have no objection. Let me just kind of tell you what my questions are. 
Bill Sonneborn:  I said, go ahead, Lee.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Again, it was very good call, but so many numbers I think -- I got to listen to the replay. S&P you said is going to downgrade KFN’s CLOs because of retirements of notes for no compensation. Even though, I think, we essentially owe the notes to ourselves. What affect will this have on the CLOs, specifically are their trading restrictions that result from the downgrades, that’s one.  Now let me just take the questions. CLO 2009-1 is the old wise data, which is now adjust to liquidating trust whose assets are distributed to shareholders. Can you give us some range or likely value to us? Third, you have cured three of the CLOs, you’ve dissolved one, what is the prospect for curing the other two CLOs, 2007-1 and I think in 2007-8. Four, you kind of mention it, but I want to (inaudible) on it, what is the likely run rate of recurring distributable earnings in the company as you reconstituted it? Five, basically, are you now comfortable with your financial position such that we are not likely to issue equity any near present prices for exchange for our debt, because you mentioned you have 50 million more in cash than you had in maturing debt and this seems to me as we spoke when you did that exchange work for $1.47 for $47 converts, that was a marginal transaction. Sixth, you have touched on this, but it is very important, the prospects for cash distribution to cover out tax liability. Can you give us a sense of what the management would recommend to the Board, recognizing you can't speak to the Board. You are going to love this one, and it's a philosophical point, but I was there at 24, I was there at 1440, emergency write-offs become 01185 and I think that philosophically, if we are not going to pay a distribution to cover out taxable income, I think KKR should forego its fees until a dividend is distributed sufficient to cover our tax liability or basically give up that LLC status and got to a C-Corp and then use this cash flow and asset value basically to create value, but buying back (inaudible) discount. And the finally question is, do you believe that the $5.69 book value is an accurate reflection of the underlying asset value of that business or do you think it understates the value of the business. Any help it could be will be very much appreciated. Thank you.
Bill Sonneborn:  Okay. Thank you Lee. We will try to take a couple of those questions. I can't promise we will get through all. First of all your question on the issues of downgrading of any of the senior or rated notes of our CLOs that has no impact whatsoever our ability to invest within the CLOs. The only downgrades we care about within the CLOs are downgrades of individual assets within the CLOs which have downgraded, say to, CCC can create restrictions in the context of the over collateralizing test and thereby the cash flows again. But again, there is no impact of actual downgrades of the securities that are being issued by our CLOs with respect to our ability to make good investments within those structures. Second, you question was on the 2009-1 form of audit transaction. Right now the company holds directly in that entity with access to it, 317.4 million of par loans and bonds, 242.4 million fair market value, plus about 15 million of cash and receivables. So after basically paying down the independent third-party Senior Note holder that’s the residual par and assets in cash left in that entity which KFN has complete and full access to for purposes of any of its corporate purposes. Now, Mike, why don’t you take his question on recurring revenue?
Mike McFerran:  Lee. As we talked about on the call, or actually reporting earning standpoint, we said, our run rate was about $0.33 for the quarter that obviously can bounce on a little bit, most probably because of interest rate changes, but we didn’t have a reasonable proxy going forward. As far as the point on, what would our cash flow run rate be on a perspective basis? We have set up till today that we generated a net income from the assets that we held to cover our debt service needs and all of our G&A expenses, we talked about on the call that we think the actions statement with CLO in ‘09-1 will have 60 to 70 million, we estimate to our annual cash flow run rate. So I think that’s a reasonable way to think about us is, we’ll probably generate somewhere north of 60 million above what we need to meet our expenses.
Bill Sonneborn:  And (inaudible) to your point on dividends or tax distributions, as I said in my opening remarks, it’s something that we very much care about delivering and wanting to return profits to our shareholders. We also talked about a 50 million of cushion in the market value relative to debt maturing between now and the end of 2012. I think from the Board’s perspective and management's perspective it’s all a question of how much cushion you want relative to market price risk in an interim period given you have a market debt facility in the context of the senior secured credit facility and once you get to that point where you feel comfortable, imagine the Board would consider making tax distribution because I know the Board is focused on that as well.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: In terms of prospect for curing 2007-1, 2007-8. Any comment on that?
Bill Sonneborn:  Well, if you look through the supplemental materials that we have sent or just put out on our website with respect to our CLOs. In particular, on page 14 of the supplemental materials, you will see that the senior OC test, particularly in the case of 2007-1 is substantially below, it’s necessary threshold. So it is unlikely that any type of similar restructuring would make sense in the context of fixing that potential structure. As to note that those CLOs have independent third-party affiliate holders and so it’s not as clear cut as the situation with the first three that were entirely owned by KFN.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: And lastly, do you have rendered opinion as to, do you think the 569 book value realistically reflects the underlying assets of the business and that represents the measure of value?
Bill Sonneborn:  569 of book value reflects through our allowance and impairments of our bond positions, 14% permanent loss on our loan and bond positions of the portfolio relative to their par. Our reasonable guess as to what that could be, but we can’t make predictions into the future. But just our best guess as to what is a fair and reasonable book value and carrying value of our portfolio.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: I won't ask you to respond to my philosophical point, but I do think we should think about how we deal with the shareholders, we don’t restore the dividends. And since we sold originally as a dividend paying vehicle, you guys have done well, before your time, but despite the devastation of stock, I think, taking your fees since inception are over $200 million. So it's been kind of a one sided win here and hopefully we can get both sides in the same pages soon enough. Thank you. I appreciate all the information on the call.
Bill Sonneborn:  Thank you Lee.
Operator:  Next we will go to Gabe Poggi from FBR Capital Markets.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Nice job with all the restructurings. I want to get your guys thoughts on the overall levered loan market. How you feel about current level? Where current levels are? What's was your thoughts processes in the second half of the year and 2010 regarding defaults? And then are you comfortable with your top 50 or your holdings in general and where you kind of have those? Where your allocations are? Just general color, if you don’t mind.
Bill Sonneborn:  Sure, absolutely. I mean, the loan market has had a substantial rally, it'll always be bond market is rallied even more interesting because of its relative yields and a low interest rate environment. And the overall leverage loan market has shrunk a lot, shrunk in a record pace over the course of the last several months, predominantly because of the strength of the high yield market which has resulted in a large number of issues. Prepaying at par is a result of refinancing and extending maturities and as a result of that, as long as the high yield market stays anywhere in the range of strength that it has been over the last eight weeks that is extraordinarily bullish for the leverage loan market. Even though its LIBOR based and doesn’t produce the same amount of yield, LIBOR can’t really get lower, it can’t go higher and the higher LIBOR will be more attractive, loans even become relative to their exiting prices. So given that they are super senior in the context of capital structure, 80% of our portfolio is in loans and 80% of that is senior secured. We like the risk reward of where we sit in the capital structure, particularly with our financing arrangements in place today that will allow us to basically get pay down through high yield market and par and redeploy that capital at 8% effective yields in the loan market today.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  Great. And then one other follow-up. See page 14 in the supplemental, how comfortable are you with those cushions if you will for the OC Tests?
Bill Sonneborn:  Gabe, we just took the action. So -- 
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  I got you. Just general viewing, obviously ‘05 to ‘06-1 have much better shape than ‘05-1, just trying to get a idea how you feel what’s inside of those?
Mike McFerran:  To Bill's point, we are comfortable with the assets as much we can be in the current environment. We think we've got reasonable cushion. We actively manage these portfolios, so it’s not that these are just static poles that we just watch and it happens -- 
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  Right.
Mike McFerran:  At their mercy. So, yes, we're reasonably comfortable and we wouldn’t have emphasized the points what we think it does to our cash flow outlook. And we think we could keep these in compliance.
Bill Sonneborn:  And what's interesting Gabe is, once you are in compliance with those, it’s easier to stay in compliance and once you are out of compliance getting back in the compliance. 
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  Right.
Bill Sonneborn:  In terms of investment flexibility, if you look at page eight of our supplemental materials, we have a number of names on our watch list, that being said, we still kind of like where we are in the capital structure and we manage actively as Mike mentioned, each one of these names in terms of our investment team to generate the best risk adjusted return taking through account the cash flow needs for KFN. So we can improve the cash flow and liquidity and ability to return profits to shareholders.
Gabe Poggi - FBR Capital Markets:  Got you. That’s what I was getting at. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.
Operator:  Next we will go to [Alan Mark] from Raymond Asset Management.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Yes, thanks. On the 2007-8, the fact that you got your amount, you're in compliance with your senior OC tests, does that help getting any cash flows out of that given what you own?
Mike McFerran:  No, unfortunately doesn’t Alan. The different OC tests are really based on where you actually own the bonds and the capital structure of the CLO. So if you pass the senior OC tests, I think for the class c, our tranche will actually receive cash flows, but as we own the mezzanine subordinate tranches, we need really to be in compliance with that subordinate OC test.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Right. (inaudible).
Bill Sonneborn:  Yes, if you look on page 12, Alan, you can see that KFN owns in 2007-8 really starts the class absence so you have to get through the OC levels to get to there before what is now picking becomes cash balance.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Right. So, based on your comments from earlier in 2007-1 and 2007-8 which are the largest ones, the fact there are non-affiliates involved in that. Would it be fair to say we should not expect any cash flows from those, because of that structure as well as may be on the 2007-1 being sort of far out of money.
Bill Sonneborn:  No. Things are very large, but they produce cash within the structures and it’s just amortizing the senior notes. So, it's not, don’t expect cash, it's just don’t expect cash now?
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Well, it's trapping the cash. Or it's paying down as you guys have pointed out, and you have done great job. And the other, other CLOs it's paying down at really very attractive (inaudible), I guess along the way -- 
Bill Sonneborn:  It is paying down, that would be attractive cheap debt, but at some point it will do so to the point where the OC becomes compliant and then will stop doing that. So and we continue to focus on managing those to generate as much risk adjusted return given the constraints of the OC to try to speed up the ability to kind of get the cash going again and not paying down LIBOR plus 50 financing within that structure.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: But those two CLOs and I don’t understand how its tax works, but I know it's unfavorable. They generate taxable income for stockholders in effect. Are there any message, I know you guys have talked little about this in the past. Are there any methods to sort of take those and sort of put them in account form, typically for tax purposes, given the fact that there is no cash coming out of there?
Bill Sonneborn:  We continued to do lots of work on ways to mitigate the tax flow income allocations to shareholders, particularly in a situation of phantom income allocations that we've experience over the last year. That remains one of our priorities. It is a difficult problem to solve, but we continue to look at it.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: As you mentioned earlier about of the downgrades of the individual instruments being the key aspect as far as future cash flow. Is there any, what’s your perspective on the ratings agency downgrades and your ability to stay within the compliance of the ones that you are in right now.
Bill Sonneborn:  Well, our team has 32 investment professionals and credit analysts constantly look each one of our underlying holdings. They do estimates of ratings ratings migrations, trying to guess what rating agencies might do, that’s what we are seeing in the fundamentals. We try to leverage that quote of information relative to what we are seeing the market and new investment opportunities and then we try to stay one step ahead of that, but again we can only control what we can control, the rating agencies can control stuff that we can't, so -- 
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: I understand, and that you don’t control rating agencies, but do you have a reasonable expectations about those downgrades and are coming up or not?
Bill Sonneborn:  No, I think the strength of the high-yield market, I think has helped slow. If you look at the number of downgrades that have occurred in the market relative to upgrades, are basically stable ratings. The negative trend that we experienced at the end of last year through the first part of this year has dramatically slowed, that second derivative is much better rate and I think it’s because situations that may not have been able to result in an amendment or a refinancing transaction may have hit a wall and that helps. So I can’t guarantee how long those market conditions will be present, but right now it’s definitely feeling better from that perspective.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Like keep on going to your staff. As far as the instruments that you've sold, recently, it sounds like you're focused on selling of the higher priced loans. Just share with us and I guess, instead of holding on to the more stressed or low priced loans or bonds, if I understood that correctly.
Bill Sonneborn:  In 2009-1 remember that was a structure that had our most expensive financing at LIBOR plus 425.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: Right. Why did you -- 
Bill Sonneborn:  If you have a discount margin of a security, let’s say 425, and you are financing it with LIBOR plus 425, you are actually creating negative present value to the shareholders at that price. This is an example and so it’s actually better for the shareholders to sell that loan at that imputed discount margin and pay-off debt than it is to kind of maintain it in that financing form, particularly you think that the upside is you can make that 425 go to 350, but the downside is that company could have a problem in the future. So from our perspective in that vehicle it was a clear positive rate of return relative to the risk to sell those specific securities, which isn’t just all the highest, because there are certain circumstances where we had concerns from the credit perspective relative to their current trading value from our perspective.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: And from a tax perspective, again, if you would have sold some of the stuff that that had fallen further would that have helped mitigate some of the tax issues?
Bill Sonneborn:  We will throw (inaudible) that have held through the whole year, or particularly once that have been here for a while, we are going throw off capital losses. So we have ordinary income allocations to the phantom, but we also generate capital losses. So I think, shareholders had to consult their tax advisors in their own specific circumstances. But KFN is not just a taxable income generator has advantage, also a capital loss generator at least recent past.
Mike McFerran:  And Alan, we appreciate your questions, but we’re going to have to move on to other callers and give our people a chance.
Alan Mark - Raymond Asset Management: No problem. Thank you very much.
Operator:  We will go back to [Lee Cooperman] of Omega Advisors.
Bill Sonneborn:  Let me just get you off the speaker, I apologize.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Bill Sonneborn:  Yes.
Mike McFerran:  Yes, we can hear.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: I don’t know if you want to address this question, but being someone ancient and probably before your time, in the 70s many of the banks underwrote REITs, like Chase Manhattan REIT, where they put their name on the security only to regret it when real estate went through its less bust, back then. And they either retired them or took them into the parent company. This is before your time, you don’t respond to, you've done a wonderful job since you and your team have been installed, I congratulate you by the way. But it's been a bit of embracement to sponsor, I am wondering with the KPE effectively taking KKR public, whether you think it's ultimately better off to remove all these conflicts where I guess 40% of your investments are KKR deals, if something goes wrong you look kind of a like embarrassed et cetera. What is the prospect of KPE, KKR taking in KFN at a fair consideration, you think that that’s kind of a pipe dream or is that a possible realistic scenario?
Bill Sonneborn:  I have no comment on that Lee.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: I think you would.
Bill Sonneborn:  In my role as CEO of KFN, I'd focus on improving the operations of KFN and generating the best results of our shareholder over time and so that’s not something that we will discuss today.
Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors: Got you. I didn’t think you wouldn’t, but you got to give it a shot, right.
Bill Sonneborn:  Thank you, Lee.
Bill Sonneborn: I will thank you all for listening to the call today and yours questions. We will continue to focus on improving shareholder value and have a good evening.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC fourth quarter 2008 conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) I would like to turn the conference over to Laurie Poggi, Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Good morning everyone, and welcome to KFN’s fourth quarter 2008 conference call. I am Laurie Poggi, Director of Investor Relations for KKR Asset Management. And with me today are Bill Sonneborn, the company's Chief Executive Officer; Michael McFerran, the company’s interim Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Van Horn, the company's Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Sossen, the company's General Counsel. Our financial results release for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, was issued today, and as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet was posted on our website. Additionally, today we filed our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A replay of this call will be available on the company’s website through Monday, March 9, 2009. At this time, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team, regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.SEC.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. And now, I will turn the call over to management. Bill, please go ahead.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today to review the company's results for the past quarter. During our call in December, I discussed both the challenges facing KFN, and the need to undertake a review of the company, its capital structure, business model and strategic plan. Specifically, we discussed coming to our shareholders with management's views and recommended actions to aggressively address near term liquidity issues, develop our business model and prudent capital structure, continue to invest in our managers platform and team, and proactively manage our credit portfolio. During today's call, I will provide you with an update on both the company and the steps we have taken over the past few months to address a number of these challenges. Currently, almost all leverage financial companies are facing real challenges and must adjust and rethink their business models. As a specialty financial company, KFN is no exception. As discussed in our December call, over the course of the fourth quarter KFN was materially impacted by the dramatic decline in leverage loan prices. The greatest stress to the company during this price decline was the impact on Wayzata, our market value CLO transaction. I will discuss Wayzata in greater detail later in the call, but I do want to briefly mention that we have successfully negotiated an agreement with the senior note holder to remove the market value margin posting provisions contained in this facility. We believe that our equity in this structure represents real value to our shareholders, even when valuing the underlying loan collateral on a liquidation basis. We believe that these changes will allow KFN to both preserve the substantial equity value of the structure, and allow the assets to realize their true long-term value. Before going any further, I will spend a few minutes putting into context how leverage loan prices performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, and provide some perspective of how they have performed so far this year. As shown on page 7 of the presentation we posted to our website this morning, approximately 84% of our investments are in leverage loans, of which 88%, nearly 90%, are senior secured. A senior secured loan is at the top of an issuer’s capital structure, and generally has between 30% to 50% of the capital structure beneath it. A senior secured loan represents a secured contractual claim on the issuer's assets, and for this reason senior secured leverage loans historically have lower price volatility and higher recovery rates when defaults have occurred, since defaults don't translate into dollar per dollar losses. Similar to most fixed-income assets, leverage loan prices during the fourth quarter were impacted by weak market technicals, very soft macroeconomic conditions, overleveraged business models, and refinancing issues. During the trough of October 2008, which was revisited in mid-December, the average bid price for leverage loans was in the low 60s. Two items to note here, first for the period from January 97, the inception of the S&P/LFTA Index for performing leverage loans through the beginning of 2008, the index had never dropped below 90. Second, historically the long-term performance of leverage loans has had a very low correlation to equities. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008 the S&P/LFTA Index produced returns that were very highly correlated with the S&P 500. The months with the worst returns in 2008 for the S&P LSTA index were September, October, and November when the returns were negative 8.3%, negative 16.3%, and negative 8.4% respectively. In comparison, the S&P 500 had returns of almost the same negative 9.1%, negative 16.9%, and negative 7.5% respectively over the same three-month period. Since mid-December when prices did touch those October lows, corporate credit prices have rebounded, average bond and low bid prices are up about 10 points between December 16 and February 19. We believe that a substantial amount of the technical pressure on loans is abating. What remains is effectively zero LIBOR conundrum. In addition, credit selection is finally once again starting to show its true importance as a large divergence has appeared between good credits and poor ones in terms of the market’s perception of the underlying loan values. During today's call, we will be covering a considerable amount of information that is summarized in the presentation we posted to our website this morning. Our goal is to give our shareholders as much transparency as possible with respect to our results for the past quarter and the challenges and opportunities we face going forward. Our bottom-line net loss of $1.2 billion for the quarter, although large when compared to KFN’s shareholders equity as of September 30, 2008, or for that matter in any historical context, reflects the balance sheet actions we have considered necessary and appropriate in today's environment, the most significant of which relates to taking large increases in our allowance for loan losses for our leverage loan portfolio as well as impairment charges related to our high yield bond holdings. With that, I'm going to hand this over to Mike to provide you details on this quarter's results as well as the status of our CLOs in Wayzata. After we go through the details of this quarter with you, I will close by providing an update on our near term management priorities.
Michael McFerran: Thanks, Bill and good morning. As Bill mentioned, I will walk you through the results for the quarter, but before doing so I'm going to spend just a few minutes to explain the impact that GAAP has on both our balance sheet and income statements. To start, on an unconsolidated bases, our investment holdings consist of the following. First, $1.3 billion par value of mezzanine and subordinated notes issued by five cash flow CLOs that are managed by KKR Asset Management. These transactions were executed as long-term financing for KFN. However, from a legal ownership perspective, we own the notes on these transactions. Second, $500 million par value of junior notes issued by Wayzata. Similar to our cash flow CLOs, Wayzata was executed as a long-term financing transaction. Third, leverage loans and high yield securities with an amortized cost basis of $352 million, residential mortgage-backed securities with an estimated fair value of $271 million. In addition, we hold investments in private equity totaling $23 million as of year-end, as well as certain investments in derivative transactions including total rate of return swaps and credit default swaps. Our five cash flow CLOs consists of two transactions completed in 2005, one transaction completed in 2006, and two transactions in 2007. A summary of our CLO transactions is shown on pages 14 to 16 of the presentation. We own 100% of the subordinated notes issued by the first three CLO transactions, but only 63% of the subordinated notes issued by the transactions completed in 2007. A separate private investment fund, managed by KKR Asset Management holds the remaining 37% interest in the two 2007 CLO transactions. In addition, we own 80% of the junior notes issued by Wayzata, and the same investment fund managed by KKR asset management holds the remaining 20%. For purposes of GAAP reporting, we consolidate 100% of the cash flow CLOs in Wayzata, and reflect the respective amounts owned by the separate investment fund as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. While consolidated notes on CLO transactions in Wayzata have certain economic characteristics of equity, they are treated as debt and not equity under GAAP. And negative results of this inconsistency is that while well one might expect a certain percentage of the economics of our CLOs in Wayzata to be allocated to a minority interest older of these three financing vehicles, this is not the case. Our own $.2 billion net loss for the quarter includes approximately $255 million or approximately $1.70 per common share of losses that would otherwise be allocable to the minority interest holder in these transactions. This is the result of GAAP and is effectively a long-term timing difference that will remain through the life of the CLO transactions and Wayzata. Upon either a decision by yes to call these transactions early or upon their ultimate maturity this resulting liability will likely be reversed and absent other changes, our book value under GAAP would show a corresponding increase. Pro forma for this affect, our book value per share as of December 31 would have been $6.10. Page 3 of the presentation provides a summary of the components of our results for the quarter, and pages 4 and 5 provide our income statements for both the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2008. Our net loss for the quarter totaled $1.2 billion or a loss of $7.85 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $59.9 million or $0.52 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2007. As Bill mentioned, our losses for the quarter reflect several portfolio and balance sheet actions that we took during the quarter. First, we recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $471.5 million, and had a charge off of $25.7 million during the quarter. This resulted in our allowance for loan losses increasing from $35 million as of September 30 to $480.8 million or $3.19 per common share as of December 31. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two components, an allocated reserve and an unallocated reserve. The allocated component represents $320.6 million or $2.12 per common share of the $480.8 million reserve, and relates to investments in leverage loans issued by 11 issuers with an aggregate cost basis of $715.4 million. This component relates to specific loans that we have determined are impaired and for which we have reserved the estimated losses, which we believe we will realize on these positions. Included in the 11 positions are Tribune, which filed for bankruptcy in December, and Lyondell, which filed for bankruptcy this past January. The cost basis of our investment in Tribune totaled $226 million as of year-end and the cost basis of our investment in Lyondell total $122 million as of year end. The unallocated components of our allowance for loan losses totaled $160.2 million or $1.06 per common share as of December 31st. We estimate the amount of the unallocated components by assigning estimated default probabilities, and loss severities to loans for which we have moderate concern. During the quarter, we also had net realized an unrealized losses on our investments totaling $745.5 million. There were three components of this loss. First, we recognized an impairment loss on securities available for sale totaling $454.3 million. This loss was recorded to write-down to market value investments in high yield debt securities from seven issuers, and two preferred stock investments. Of this amount, $216.5 million relates to investments in senior and subordinated bonds issued by one company, where we had a total costs basis [ph] bonds of $262 million. As a result of our re-underwriting of every provision in the portfolio, we have sold the investments in this company subsequent to year-end. The remaining $237.8 million or $1.58 per common share relates to investments which we still hold today. Second, we realized $156.3 million of losses on our investments during the quarter, of which $137.5 million relates to sales of assets which were held in Wayzata. These sales were undertaken to deleverage the vehicle, as part of our negotiations with the senior note holder, and pursuant to the terms of the documents governing Wayzata, which at the time required the sale of any asset, downgraded to CCC. The third component of the $745.5 million of losses is a loss totaling $137.3 million on amounts designated as held for sale as of year end. This loss relates to the lower cost for market adjustments on these loans, which have either been sold or which we continue to hold for sale. A portion of the sales were in conjunction in with the refinancing of the company's revolver, whereby $378 million drawn on the old revolver was replaced with $300 million drawn on the new revolver. During the quarter, we also recognized $72.9 million in net realized and unrealized losses on derivatives and foreign exchange. This amount consisted of net realized an unrealized losses on total returns swaps of approximately $100 million, which is partially offset by gains totaling approximately $5 million and $22 million on FX forward contracts, and credit default swap positions respectively. Our total returns swaps are summarized on page 13 on the presentation. We used total rate of return swaps to finance certain leverage loan positions, primarily those which are denominated in foreign currencies since those investments are prohibited from being held in our CLOs. While at the same time total rate of return swaps provide perfect FX hedges. Although analogous to financing from an economic standpoint, total returns swaps are included in derivatives in our consolidated financial statements, since they are treated as derivatives under GAAP. The total notional amount of our total return of returns swaps decreased over 50% from $442 million as of December 31, 2007, to $208 million as of December 31st 2008. As certain loans on swap have declined materially in value, we have purchased them off-swap since the amount of cash were we were holding against them under our recent agreements was economically undesirable. As of year-end, the weighted average maturity of our total rate of return swaps was approximately 11 months, and we had a net debt under these swaps of approximately $50 million as of year-end. During the quarter, we also recognized mark-to-market losses totaling $34.2 million on our RMBS investments. As of year-end, our investment in mortgage-backed securities had an aggregate cost basis of $353.7 million, and an estimated fair value of $270.7 million. I do want to spend a minute describing how RMBS investments are presented on our financial statements. Of the $278.7 million fair value of RMBS, $167.9 million on the six securitization trusts, we are the primary beneficiary, and therefore consolidate the trust under GAAP. By doing so, we show the underlying assets of those troughs on our balance sheet as mortgage loans, and show the debt issued by those troughs and held by third parties as liabilities. While we reflect these amounts in our financial statements, we have no exposure to RMBS above $270.7 million, we actually own. In order to reconcile our GAAP balance sheet to this amount, simply take the $102.8 million of mortgage debt securities on our balance sheet, the $2.62 billion of mortgage loans in our balance sheet, and $10.8 million of real estate owned those included in other assets in our balance sheet, as described in Note 8, to our consolidated financial statements, and subtract the $2.46 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities issued from our balance sheet. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities we hold, approximately 90% is rated investment-grade, as well as 90% consists of mortgages and securitizations that we structured earlier in mid-2005. The original mortgage collateral underline our mortgage-backed security investment totaled over $10 billion. At year-end, the inception to date losses has been approximately $10 million or 10 basis points of the original collateral amount. We currently find these assets performing in line with our expectations and intend to hold them through their maturity. Next, I will spend a few minutes reviewing noninvestment expenses, which totaled $18.3 million for the quarter as compared to $21.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2008, base management fees averaged just under $3 million per month. Through the losses recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008, the multi-base management fee during 2009 will be approximately $1.2 million a month resulting in an annual expense reduction of approximately $18 million. As Bill will discuss later in this call, our management company has also agreed to defer payments of a percentage of our base management fee through the end of 2009. Now, I will spend a few minutes reviewing our investment portfolio, which is summarized on pages 7 through 11 of the presentation. As of year-end, the total carrying value of our corporate loan and high yield debt investments, excluding loans held for total returns swaps, was $8.1 billion, and the total par amount of these investments was $9.7 billion. As we have articulated in the past, our portfolio is heavily concentrated in senior secured loans of large cap companies. Approximately 90% of our leverage loans are senior secured in the capital structure and approximately 75% of our portfolio is concentrated in the 50 companies. Our top 20 holdings represent approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. Page nine of the presentation provides a summary of our top 50 holdings by issuer, ranging from largest to smallest. And page 10 provides a stratification of our portfolio on Moody’s industry classification. Through year-end, we had three defaults of loans on our portfolio with the total cost basis of $312.7 million. One of these loans, restructured by converting our debt for a 28% interest in the equity of the company. Also included in the default amount is Tribune, which represents $226 million or just over 70% of our total defaults during the quarter. Next, I will spend some time reviewing the current status of Wayzata and our CLOs. At the time we closed Wayzata in 2007, it was $2 billion market value CLO transaction that was ramped up to full utilization during the second quarter of 2008. Our investment in Wayzata consisted of purchasing $320 million of the $400 million of the aggregate amount of junior notes issued. The remaining $80 million of junior notes was purchased by a separate fund managed by KKR Asset Management. The senior notes issued by Wayzata totaled $1.6 billion and were held by a single counterparty or senior lender to the transaction. As Wayzata was structured as a market value transaction, material price declines in corporate loans during 2008, most notably during the fourth quarter, led to us posting $180 million of additional cash collateral to the transaction through the purchase of additional junior notes. The posting of additional cash collateral as well as the sale of assets from Wayzata totaling $628.9 million during that fourth quarter of 2008 were both undertaken to avoid defaults under the transaction that could have led to the senior lender for closing on Wayzata’s collateral. On January 12, 2009, Wayzata was amended to eliminate the market value-based covenants, and of equal importance, the requirement to sell any assets downgraded to CCC. Consequently, we are no longer required to post additional cash margin as a result of declining market values of the underlining collateral. This amendment has allowed us to preserve our equity value in the Wayzata structure and participate in potential appreciation of this value as and if when prices improve. Wayzata is a valuable asset given the relatively low pro forma leverage it provides KFN. Nevertheless, under the amended facility, cash flow generated by the collateral will not be distributed to junior note holders, including us, until all senior obligations of Wayzata are paid in full or otherwise satisfied through hyper amortization of senior notes through our cash flow. As such, our cash flow forecast assumes that Wayzata will not generate any cash to the company for the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict at this time, how long the cessation of cash flows will last. However, we do retain the right to call the structure at any time if to do so is economically attractive to KFN. Several additional changes are made to Wayzata as part of the amendment process, including first, to increase the coupon on the senior secured notes to 3 months LIBOR plus 3.75%, which under certain circumstances may increase to a maximum of three-month LIBOR plus 5%. Second, reduce the aggregate outstanding par amount of senior secured notes to approximately $675 million using both free cash in the structure, and proceeds from the sale of certain assets designated for liquidation by the senior note holder. And third, significantly limit our right to reinvest principal proceeds from the collateral in new assets. In addition, as we previously mentioned we were able to substantially modify the portfolio eligibility criteria, so that we will be no longer required to sell downgraded securities. Also, the parties have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to restructure the vehicle to convert Wayzata into cash flow at CLO, extending its maturity from 2012 to 2017, substantially improving the refinancing risk containment in the structure. With respect to our cash flow CLO transactions, as of December 31, the majority of our investments in corporate loans, and corporate debt securities were held in five cash flow CLOs. Our holdings in these cash flow transactions are summarized on pages 14 to 16 of the presentation. These transactions contain certain interest coverage and over-collateralization tests that have not met resultant cash flows that would be paid to the mezzanine and subordinated note holders, including us. We need to deleverage the transaction, until such time as the respective tests are in compliance. The December 2008 monthly reports from the CLO transactions showed that four out of the five cash flow CLO transactions were out of compliance with one or more of the respective over-collateralization tests. Page 17 of the presentation provides a summary of our CLOs and the various key metrics from the December 2008 reports. As shown on this page, of our CLOs, with the exception of CLO 2005-1, were failing their respect subordinated over-collateralization test as a year-end and CLO 2005-1 had a small cushion of $1.1 million under this test. As the majority of our cash flow CLOs, excuse me, as a majority of our cash flows from CLOs come from the subordinated notes, we believe that this is the most important OC test. We believe that during 2009 each of our cash flow CLO transactions will be out of compliance with OC tests for intermittent periods, and certain if not all of our CLOs will be out of compliance throughout the entire year. The fact that CLOs trap cash, and use the cash to deleverage is material to our cash flow. For 2009, based on current interest rates, approximately 70% of our total cash inflows from investments, would otherwise come from CLOs if they are not trapping cash and deleveraging. We do not expect our CLOs to generate significant amounts of cash for the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict at this time how long this will last. Our cash flow forecast for 2009 assumes that we do not receive any cash inflows from either Wayzata or our five cash flow CLOs. Instead, our cash inflows will come from the assets that we hold outside of the CLOs, consisting of certain residential mortgage backed securities and investments in corporate loans and high-yield securities. Based on our current liquidity and access to liquidity, the $100 million standby credit facility provided by KKR, we believe that we are able to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. With that Jeff is going to discuss tax issues related to our structure and estimated timings for the 2008 K-1 to our shareholders.
Jeff Van Horn: Thanks Mike. As you know, KFN is a publicly traded partnership that is not treated as a corporation for tax purposes because it satisfies certain requirements in the tax code for continued treatment as a partnership or flow-through entity. As a result, KFN is generally not subject to federal and state taxes at the entity level. Instead KFN shareholders are taxed on their allocable share of KFN’s items of income, gains, losses, and deduction regardless of whether or when they receive cash distributions from KFN. In addition, some of our investments, especially our interest in CLOs may produce taxable income to KFN and thus KFN shareholders, regardless of whether or when the investments distribute cash to us. This is a situation, for example, with respect to our interest in CLOs, whose investments have still paying interest income currently, but that have failed certain over-collateralization tests, which results in the excess cash flow from such investments that will normally be distributed to KFN to instead be used to pay down the principal on the senior issued by the CLOs. Since a substantial portion of KFN’s investments are financed by these CLOs, a substantial portion of KFN’s taxable income is non-cash or phantom taxable income that will be allocated to KFN’s shareholders, who will then be subject to federal and tax taxes. Further, losses recognized by KFN on the sale or exchange of its investments will generally result in a capital loss allocable to our shareholders, which cannot be used to offset the ordinary taxable income generated by KFN’s investments, including the CLO interest that I just mentioned. Notwithstanding these tax issues, we believe that a KFN shareholder who held shares during all of calendar year 2008, should have received cash distributions in calendar year 2008, in an amount sufficient to satisfy the shareholders federal and state tax liabilities on their estimated allocable share of KFN 2008 items of taxable income, gains, losses, and deduction. Providing estimates for 2009 is difficult at best. However, if we assume that KFN’s run rate earnings during 2009 will be approximately $0.30 per share per quarter or a $1.20 per share for all of calendar year 2009, and the shareholders federal tax rate is 35% and state tax rate is 9.3%, then the shareholder’s combined federal and state tax liabilities, net of federal benefits for the deduction of state taxes will be approximately $0.49 per share. For the purposes of this example, run rate earnings is estimated to approximate taxable income before realized an unrealized gains and losses, and assumes full deductibility of our G&A expenses. Taxable income can vary substantially depending upon numerous factors relating to the shareholders individual tax characteristics, as well as holding period among other items. As a partnership, KFN is required to file 2008 tax returns and issue scheduled K-1s to shareholders honorable for April 15, 2009, unless an extension of time to file the tax assurance and issue scheduled K-1 is granted by the IRS, in which case the due date for these filings is September 15, 2009. Notwithstanding these due dates, KFN will make every effort possible and expects to issue 2008 scheduled K-1s to shareholders by the end of March 2009. The scheduled K-1s will first be available electronically from our website, and they will be mailed as well. Similar to 2007, KFN experienced a technical termination for tax purposes due to the heavy trading volume in its shares during 2008. As a result, under the tax rules, KFN will be required to file and prepared two tax returns and issued two sets of scheduled K-1s to shareholders for the 2008 tax year. Despite these additional filing requirements, we still expect to issue both sets of K-1s to shareholders by the end of March 2009. With that I'm going to hand the call back over to Bill.
Bill Sonneborn: Thanks Jeff. Our management team is focused on four key priorities. First, continue to aggressively address near-term liquidity issues. Second, ensure that the company’s capital structure protects long-term value for our shareholders. Third, proactively manage our investment portfolio, which will include some credit sales as well as playing a lead role in certain work out restructuring and default situations. And fourth, continue to invest in our world-class investment and operating platform, which serves as the external manager of the company. Now, let us go through these points in more detail. First, liquidity. To withstand the substantial increase in volatility of credit prices, we had to reduce the potential need to gross margin on any market value financing facilities. We believe we have done so. Net debt under total rate of return swaps declined by approximately $125 million during the quarter from approximately $175 million as of September 30 to approximately $50 million as of December 31. Additionally, we paid off approximately $100 million of the revolver during the quarter, by reducing it from $378 million outstanding under our previous credit facility as of September 30 to $276 million outstanding under our current credit facility that we closed in November. We have also successfully completed step one of the restructuring of Wayzata by obtaining agreement from the senior note holder to remove both the mark-to-market and portfolio eligibility criteria restrictions within the transaction. We have now turned our efforts towards the hopeful completion of step two of the Wayzata restructuring to reduce the refinancing risk that is within the structure. This will involve converting the structure to a cash flow CLO with the corresponding extension of the maturity of its liability from 2012 to 2017. Other than capital structure issues, which I will address shortly, the largest remaining component of market value or margin debt relates to our total rate of return swaps, whereas we show on slide 13 of the presentation, we currently have 50 million of net debt outstanding. As most of these swaps mature in late 2009, we are working on solutions to refinance this that or pay it off without having to sell a significant portion of the assets that are financed by it. In a scenario where we cannot extend the financing or obtain new financing for these assets, we would seek to sell the assets held on swap and generate sufficient proceeds to pay off their existing debt. If we did sell the assets, it would eliminate the option to recover something closer to par value on these assets, thereby realizing the loss. Note that the assets underlying the swaps are already marked-to-market through our GAAP book value. As Mike previously stated, we believe that we are able to meet obligations for at least the next 12 months. As for our CLOs the use of otherwise distributable cash to deleverage these transactions significantly reduces our free cash flow. Ultimately, we expect our CLOs to provide long-term value to KFN. In the meantime, the trapping of cash and the deleveraging of these structures will impact our ability to make any cash distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future. Our strategy for the CLOs is to continue to focus on active portfolio management, based on the credit fundamentals of the underlying loan collateral to realize maximum value for new structures over the long term. We will accomplish this through rotating out of certain assets into other assets with higher spreads and reduced risk of loss. It is also worth noting here that we are retaining valuable opportunities within a number of these CLOs. We have the ability under the agreements covering them to purchase additional subordinated notes to effectively enhance their collateralization and maintain the low-cost liabilities within these structures until their final stated maturity. As a firm, we at KKR have taken certain steps to support KFN’s liquidity position. First, KKR provided an unsecured $100 million credit facility to KFN last November that as of today remains undrawn. Second, KKR has agreed to defer payment of 50% of the management fees for the period from January to November 2009 to be paid in December 2009. As mentioned previously, this deferral is based on the management fee that is less than half the amount that was in 2008 and puts the payment date post the expiration of the first part of our revolver. In January 2009, we also took the additional step of activating the management fees for all of our CLOs including Wayzata, and we will refund to KFN its share of this amount, as a reduction of general and administrative expenses. This is a way of getting cash into KFN that would otherwise be used to the leverage the CLOs, given that the senior collateral management fees at the CLO levels are treated within the structures within the senior notes. From an income statement standpoint, this activation of CLO management fees will be P&L neutral, but from a cash flow standpoint it should add approximately $10 million to KFN’s liquidity during calendar year 2009. Now that we have taken action to address near-term liquidity issues, we must begin to focus on our next priority, our capital structure, particularly as it relates to any item in the future might stress liquidity or act as an impediment to our ability to protect long-term value for our shareholders. As we disclosed last quarter, our $300 million revolving credit facility with the final maturity in November 2010 will be reduced to $150 million in November 2009, unless we successfully syndicate $150 million of the balance. Accordingly, we need to either syndicate, refinance, or pay off this $150 million excess balance. While syndication remains an option, today's environment makes that extremely challenging. In addition, by November 2009, we must also comply with borrowing base restrictions contained within the facility, which may require a further reduction in the aggregate borrowings below the $150 million total facility value. As of December 31, we had $275.6 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolver. The other significant liquidity challenge we faced is the maturity of our convertible notes in July 2012. We recognized that our long-term plan needs to address these future maturities. A summary of our holding company debt is shown on page 12 of the presentation posted on our website. As of December 31, 2008, we had not drawn on the $100 million standby credit facility provided by KKR. Regarding our legal structure, our current PTP structure presents challenges. Most notably, the phantom tax issue that Jeff previously described. However, we believe that this structure is currently the best alternative given our liquidity situation. The third point I mentioned previously is portfolio management. As we work through the current credit cycle, we are clearly not expecting the eventual economic recovery to be V shaped or quick. We also anticipate default rates could be larger than those forecasted by S&P and Moody’s. Our portfolio investment strategy includes leveraging our deep resources across KKR, including our private equity professionals and the KKR Capstone operations team as appropriate. This will be most reflective in certain work out situations, where we lead or participate in a turnaround effort. An example relates to an existing investment in which our debt interest was converted into a 28% equity interest during the quarter, but where we now also have board seats at the company. To support the realization of a positive outcome from this investment, we brought in the KKR Capstone operations team to assist this business during its restructuring, and are working closely with our private equity professionals to develop value creation alternatives for this business. KFN’s book value at year-end was $4.40 per share. As Mike described earlier, this is in part reflecting KFN absorbing all of the losses that are economically allocable to the minority interest holder of two of our cash flow CLOs and Wayzata. After adjusting for this economic allocation of minority interest, the book value per share on a pro forma basis is $6.10 per share. The total effective “reserved losses” reflected in our balance sheet have after excluding loans held for sale in the $216.5 million impairment charge recorded on the $262 million high-yield securities we sold subsequently to year-end are $718.6 million or approximately $4.75 per share, which consists of our allowance for loan losses of $480.8 million, and the impairment charges totaling $237.8 million on securities we still hold. That $4.75 has not been realized. It is our best estimate of future losses in our portfolio. That said the ultimate amount of losses realized can be more or less in this amount, and could therefore impact book value either positively or negatively in the future. The leverage loan in high yield bond markets has stabilized since mid-December, and has started to delink from the equity markets. Technical pressure in leverage loan and high yield prices is abating at present, as we have seen a reversion to fundamentals emerge. While we remain cautiously optimistic, that fundamentals will continue to drive prices, we are not operating as if that was the case. We are continuing to position the company for a variety of market environments. The fourth point relates to our deep and experienced team. We have a team of over 30 world-class investment professionals with diverse and complimentary industry backgrounds. In addition, our talented operations and support team of over 40 professionals are focused on financial and risk management. We continue to invest in KKR Asset Management team in capital through adding resources to both of these teams. Before we move on to answering your questions, I want to share some final thoughts with you. KFN today represents unique leverage opportunity to participate in the ultimate recovery of predominantly senior secured loans. In addition, its financing structures represent intriguing options on new investments. I'm very proud of our team of the 72 investments professionals and operating team members who are working extraordinarily hard on behalf of our company. I'm also deeply appreciative of all my colleagues and partners within KKR’s Private Equity and Capital Markets businesses, who continue to provide substantial support in maximizing the value of KFN to its shareholders. We have a very impressive team focused on the business. Mike and I as well as the rest of the management team and professional across KKR continue to work hard to maximize the value of your investment in KFN. Thank you again for joining us on this call. Now we welcome your questions. Operator can you please open the lines.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) We will take our first question from John Hecht with JMP Securities.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys hear me?
Bill Sonneborn: Yes we can. Good morning.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Good morning. I wonder if you guys could just looking at page nine in your top 50 holdings, may be take us through what might perceive as a watch list for some of the investments where you kind of trying to watch for incremental risk in high degrees of risk.
Bill Sonneborn: Sure. We can spend a little bit of time talking about we think is watch list. There are a number of names on the list on page 9, which we do hold in our watch list and a number of these names that we also reflect in both our specific and general reserve from a probability of loss perspective. Going through the list, if you kind of look in the top 10, obviously Realogy is one that has been on our watch list for a considerable period of time which is listed as number 10 on the list. In addition number 14, Las Vegas Sands is on that list, Lyondell number 22 is on the list, Marsico number 26 is on the list, Michaels Stores number 28 is on that list, Harrah's number 37 is on that list, and NXP number 33 is on that list, Nuveen Investments number 39, Freescale number 40. I think that Neiman Marcus number 50 is on that list.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Will you guys put together a general provision this quarter, I guess in the context of that type of watch list? What kind of frequency and recovery rates would you be assuming given the credit markets right now?
Bill Sonneborn: We look at each credit on its own, depending upon the circumstances of the credit and forecast both the probability as well as the severity of loss based upon the underlying position we hold in the capital structure, the fundamentals of how that business is performing, our own expectations of what the asset value of that business, what would happen to the extent that business went into restructuring, and what we think the ultimate realized losses would be. So it is hard to say as a general rule what that number is because it is case-by-case, company specific.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay. Is there a range of understanding a specific – you might have a wide variety but is there a range of recovery or maybe an average rate of recovery you might expect in this cycle and maybe can you discuss how that might differ from prior cycles?
Bill Sonneborn: Sure. Well, Michael will give probably at a weighted average across their portfolio of what we expect, even though again it is company by company specific. Go ahead Mike.
Michael McFerran: Sure. Hi John. You know we look at the portfolio as of year-end, and if we back out you know, the adjustments we took for loans held for sale and kind of carve that out of the portfolio, and carve out the bonds that we sold subsequent to year-end. They were in excess of $200 million, and our reserves effectively provide a 13% loss protection for our aggregate loan of bond portfolio as a percent – we are retaining the portfolio at 87% of power. You know, you could run through any permutation you want, what default probabilities and loss severity scenarios get you there. As Bill stated, you know, we start with kind of a bottoms up asset by asset analysis. We do obviously look at it from the top down and see if it makes sense big pictures. So, if you look at our portfolio and assume something between, you know, 15% and 20% defaults, and somewhere between 30% and 50% loss severities, you know where we are today accounts for that. As far as you know, the ultimate outcome, you know, it is going to wait and see obviously.
Bill Sonneborn: And that is weighted average across the whole portfolio. And currently, we are going to have a number of situations which are power recoveries and other situations which will be much, much worse ultimate recoveries, but the weighted average is roughly that 13% loss expectation as of December 31st.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay, great. I appreciate that color. And the last question I have is, you mentioned that 30% of the cash flow is to support the business reside from outside the CLOs and the Wayzata structure. I assume that portion from the MBS portfolio, but I'm wondering if you can give us the characteristics of the bonds, maybe the par amount and the type of spreads in those bonds that are providing for the cash flows as well.
Bill Sonneborn: Yes John. As we started the call, we said we had about $350 million cost spaces of investments in loans, bonds held outside of the CLOs and Wayzata. So, if you look at those assets you know, the cash coupon on bonds averages around 11% and cash coupon on leverage loans, issuance around the LIBOR plus 250 range, and then you have the MBS assets, which are, you know, generating cash yields at the current market value, just north of 20%.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: But the total par outside of the CLOs is about $880 million.
Bill Sonneborn: Yes, $880 million.
John Hecht – JMP Securities: Okay, thank you guys very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will take our next question from Louis Margolis, Select Advisors.
Louis Margolis – Select Advisors: Good morning gentleman. Could you describe the way you allocate loans across your three distinct pools. I guess you have the KFN Financial, you have a hedge fund, and you have managed accounts. I think you announced last year you took in $3 billion. How do you allocate across those structures. Could you also tell us the returns of the hedge fund's last year?
Bill Sonneborn: Sure, I'll talk about allocation. I don’t think it is something we will disclose in terms of returns in the hedge fund on this call, but in terms of allocation, we pro rata allocate any trade across all of our pools of capital based upon their underlying investment restrictions within those vehicles. So, in the event, we were buying a security, we would be buying that and pro rata allocating across to all of our vehicles based upon their available capital, so that the effective treatment if any of the entities is equal.
Louis Margolis – Select Advisors: The returns at KFN were catastrophic last year. Were they materially different than the hedge funds?
Bill Sonneborn: There are differences between KFN and any hedge fund most materially being holding company leverage.
Louis Margolis – Select Advisors: Have you given any thought to trying to recover historical fees. There were very high fees charged over the last several years. Communications with shareholders have been – to say they are very least, poor. Have you given any thought to try and recover fees from any of the individuals or entities who took them?
Jeff Van Horn: When we looked back on the situation and see, you know, net-net when you think of kind of the history of KFN as a legal entity, KKR has put more into KFN than it has received economically in terms of management fees or in financial fees over its life. So, it has been supported consistently by KKR and you will see that you know in connection with it still having, you know, a full 72 person team supporting KFN’s business and operations, even though our management fees are down as a result of allowance for loan loss and other balance sheet items we took in the fourth quarter by half 2009 versus 2008 on an expected basis, and we are deferring the receipt of half of those management fees until after the date when we deal with the revolver situation this year.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sonneborn, I like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Bill Sonneborn: Thank you all. I appreciate you being patient listening to this lengthy call. We appreciate your support and will keep you abreast of any further actions we take. Have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

Analysts: Faye Elliott - Merrill Lynch Jim Ballan - JPMorgan Don Fandetti - Citigroup John Hecht - JMP Securities James Shanahan - Wachovia Douglas Harter - Credit Suisse
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the KKR Financial Holdings LLC conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter 2008. Today's call is being recorded. Today's call includes a presentation by management followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Now, at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laurie Poggi. Please go ahead.
Laurie Poggi: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to KKR Financial Holdings third quarter conference call. I am Laurie Poggi, Director of Investor Relations for KKR Fixed Income. And with me today are Nino Fanlo, the company's Chief Executive Officer; Dave Netjes, the company's Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Van Horn, the company's Chief Financial Officer; Andrew Sossen, the company's General Counsel; and Michael McFerran, KKR Fixed Income's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, was issued today, and as with prior quarters, a supplemental information packet was posted on our website. Additionally, today we filed our Form 10-Q for the third quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A replay of this call will be available on our website at www.KKR.com through November 17. At this time, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of the management team, regarding the operations and the results of the operations of the company, as well as general economic conditions. These beliefs and the related forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in greater detail in the filings we have made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.SEC.gov. Our actual results may vary materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. And now, I will turn the call over to management. Nino, please go ahead.
Nino Fanlo: Thanks, Laurie. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining our call today. The headlines over the past three months speak for themselves. We are operating in extremely difficult times. The deleveraging of corporate and commercial America is creating a dislocation in the capital markets not witnessed since the Great Depression. Liquidity is scarce. Markets are extremely volatile. And the economy is increasingly facing once in a century challenges. The crisis began in the summer of 2007, as so many of us recall. And while conditions have continued to deteriorate, I don't believe any of us could have predicted the events, and the severity of events, that have taken place over the past 10 weeks. We have witnessed the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a bailout of AIG which today increased dramatically, and the disappearance of three legendary Wall Street investment banks who survived the previous depression. We have also witnessed the failure of other commercial banks and a wave of consolidation take place in the financial services sector. To list out all that has occurred would simply take too much time. However, the message is clear. The world has changed, and the landscape of financial services is fundamentally different than it was just one quarter ago. During September, we witnessed a dramatic decline in leveraged loan prices, which was only exceeded by the sharp drop in loan prices in October. While we have positioned our balance sheet to be insulated for market value changes, we are not immune to them. As we have previously mentioned, we felt we were well positioned for a '90-'92 recession and that we would adjust adequately, if the recession was as difficult as '73-'75 or '80-'82. However, we need to reflect on our condition for today's environment, which may be closer to the 1930s. For example, the average LCD flow name composite was a price of 88% on September 1 and as of November 6, it had dropped and it was 75%. To put this into context, because of their seniority in the capital structure, leveraged loans have historically traded near par, and loan prices declined only to the mid-90%s during the '01-'02 recession and not substantially below 90% in the '90-'92 recession. Clearly today's prices are function of not only difficult credit fundamentals but extraordinary market technicals. The equity markets are priced at a level reflecting a recession. However, credit is priced at a level assuming a depression. Our view of the current and anticipated economic environment is best summarized as very difficult but manageable. We do believe that the next few years will be challenging for the economy and a deep recession is a distinct possibility. The coordinated efforts of industrialized nations and central banks will significantly mitigate the severity of this downturn and positively assist the economy, but the actions taken most likely will not stave off a severe recession. As we continue through the cycle, we expect that asset prices will eventually reflect fundamentals. And actually the last couple of weeks Dave and I are comforted by the fact that this is increasingly the case. Companies that experienced significant stress with expectations of default, however, will see that their prices remain near current levels, while the companies that do have the strong fundamentals will experience accretion in credit prices. Liquidity in the global markets is terribly restricted and things may still get worse as the economy enters this deepening recession. Accordingly, KFN must be positioned as such. As we face these challenges, we know that our portfolio is well positioned with regard to senior term loan investment in companies that the KKR Group knows well. As we've described in our past calls, we have made investments in companies that we believe based on scale and management are reasonably positioned to weather a downturn to the economy. Furthermore, the senior debt orientation of our portfolio helps to cushion any unexpected credit deterioration. Defaults on senior loans do not necessarily translate into significant credit losses, and in certain cases, may not generate any losses. We believe we have a number of companies today whose price's trade at material discounts to par that reflect this instance where losses would be either minimal or none should a default arise. Now with regard to our liabilities which we have spent considerable time over the past few years, over a 70% of our debt consists of long-term funding in the form of cash flow CLOs. With a weighted average spread to LIBOR of 48 basis points, these liabilities are valuable as they are both low cost and have a weighted average remaining term to maturity of over 10 years, which is nearly two times the average life of the assets they finance. In the current market environment, certain of these structures will trap cash and deleverage modestly. And Dave will explain how this operates in a few minutes. However, they will continue to provide long-term value to KFN and its shareholders. To bridge today's volatile market so that our assets may realize their full value, we are taking several important steps. We have made the difficult decision to not pay a dividend for the third quarter, to retain liquidity and to provide maximum flexibility with respect to uses of liquidity in the current extremely challenged environment. We have also successfully completed the replacement of our revolving credit facility that was due to mature in the middle of 2009. This new facility provides us with increased flexibility, as it extends the maturity of our revolving credit financing and provides for less restricted financial covenants, that will enhance our flexibility to make appropriate portfolio management decisions on behalf of all of our shareholders. We replaced the existing facility with two new facilities. Dave will provide you with more detail later in the call, and I will comment only briefly here. The two new facilities consisted of $300 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility provided by Bank of America and Citibank and we're grateful to them, and a $100 million unsecured standby credit line provided by our manager. It is not clear we will need to utilize the capacity provided by the standby line, but it is there to provide additional flexibility in bridging the difference between the $368 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility, with the $300 million capacity of the new revolving credit facility. We do not expect to borrow against the $100 million standby credit line initially, as we have sufficient liquidity to bridge the gap between our previous and new borrowing-based credit facilities. Rather we view the $100 million credit line from our manager as an akin to insurance policy for our business as we work our way through this environment over the coming months. In today's environment obtaining any financing is actually a remarkable achievement, and we are very pleased we were able to execute these transactions albeit at a significantly higher cost than financing transactions we have been able to execute prior to the current financial crisis in the market. Our condition and our challenges are no different than other borrowers face today and, therefore, we are grateful to our banks and our colleagues at KKR, who worked so diligently to get this done prior to today's release. We also as one would expect us to do are exploring various strategic alternatives including a change in corporate structure, a conversion to a bank, and the acquisition of a depository. These are preliminary considerations only, and we expect that alternatives will evolve and develop as the economic landscape changes over time. However, it is important for us to recognize the considerable advantages today, that depository institutions enjoy as a result of the changing landscape. I again want to emphasize the proactive steps taken are based on the strategy of providing us flexibility, and are prudent given our view of the current and anticipated market environment. The economic landscape is changing rapidly and we are committed to positioning KFN accordingly. The foundation of our business is our people, our asset selection and our financing structures, all of which provide a sound base that will serve our shareholders well in the long term and we will get through these difficult times. I will now ask Dave to walk you through the details of the financing transactions that we have entered into.
Dave Netjes: Thanks, Nino, and good afternoon, everyone. As Nino described, we have executed two new financing transactions. The rationale for doing so was straightforward. And as Nino said, we wanted to provide ourselves with flexibility in today's challenging environment. The covenants in our prior facility would have constrained our ability to make certain asset decisions, as they contain both a restrictive net worth covenant and a minimum net worth covenant. The terms of our new credit facility provide us with the needed flexibility to manage our investment portfolio without excessive covenant constraints. The terms of our new credit facility are described in greater detail in our Form 10-Q that we filed with the SEC today. The new facility is $300 million, which is a reduction of $200 million from our previous $500 million facility. Currently, as Nino mentioned, we have approximately $368 million of borrowings outstanding under our existing credit facility. As part of entering into this new agreement, we are paying down the excess amount outstanding of approximately $68 million using existing cash. The $300 million facility size is reduced by the current lenders to $150 million on the one-year anniversary of this agreement. And if we can satisfy the $150 million commitment reduction by either paying down the facility, or syndicating the facility to other lenders prior to November 2009. The facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3%. Under the terms of this facility, we are restricted from making cash distributions to shareholders in excess of the amounts that we estimate to be necessary for our shareholders to satisfy federal and state tax liabilities with respect to their share of the company's taxable income until 2009, so long as we satisfy certain borrowing base conditions contained in the credit agreement. As previously mentioned, we have entered into in an unsecured standby revolving credit facility with our manager. This agreement provides us with the ability to have an extra source of liquidity to utilize again, if needed, as we reduce the borrowings outstanding under our current credit facility. This agreement matures in December 2010, and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 15% with the ability to pick up to 80% of the interest owned during any period by having it capitalized to the outstanding principal balance of the loan outstanding. We have adequate liquidity today, but given the uncertainty of the financial markets, entering into an agreement for this facility provides us with added flexibility and comfort. This transaction was executed at market terms and was reviewed accordingly by both our outside counsel our Board of Directors and the affiliated transaction committee of our Board of Directors. Next, I will spend a few minutes reviewing our CLOs and the Wayzata facility with you. As you are aware, we currently have five cash flow CLO transactions outstanding, consisting of CLO 2005-1, 2005-2, 2006-1, 2007-1 and 2007-A. In aggregate, these transactions totaled $8 billion. An affiliate of our manager owns 37% of CLO 2007-1 and 2007-A. The indentures governing our CLO transactions include numerous compliance tests with respect to the collateral, the majority of which relate to the portfolio profile. In the event that a portfolio profile test is not met, the indenture places restrictions around our ability to reinvest available principal proceeds generated by the collateral in the CLOs until the specific tests have been cured. In addition to the profile test, the indentures for the CLO transactions include other tests including overcollateralization tests and interest coverage tests. Overcollateralization tests or OC tests simply measure the ratio of the collateral value of the assets in the CLO to the debt for which the test is being measured. OC tests are stressed when assets are treated at market value rather than in par in the calculation. In today's environment, it's apparent that the market value of assets is below par across the board, and as a result, we expect to experience periods of noncompliance with OC tests in certain of our CLO transactions. Two things are happening in the market today that are making this likely. First, downgrades of investments to CCC increase the dollar amount of assets that are treated or carried at market value. And second, prices of all assets have been declining, which compounds this issue. The details of the mechanics of our CLOs and the OC tests are described in further detail in the Sources of Funds section of the Management Discussion and Analysis in our Form 10-Q that we filed with the SEC today. Next, I want to emphasize a few points. First, our portfolio is performing quite well, and the rating agency actions are expected response to a recessionary environment. Next, the historic decline in loan prices that we have all witnessed is the primary driver of pressure on our CLO OC tests. To-date, none of our CLOs have actually failed an OC test on their payment date. If those tests were run based on our prices of as of last Friday, we would expect that we would be out of compliance with the tests for three of our CLOs. Just a moment on what noncompliance means. First, and most importantly, we are not required to put up any cash. And equally, if not more important, we are not required to sell any of the assets. When an OC test is out of compliance, the quarterly cash payments due to us from the structure is simply use to reduce the senior debt that has been issued to and has been purchased by third-parties. By doing so, if prices remain flat, the OC test is naturally brought back into compliance through deleveraging. And at that point in time, we would continue to get cash returned from this structure. This problem obviously accelerates when prices appreciate, or the OC test is obviously fixed one prices appreciate and significant price appreciation will actually cure the OC test. In the interim, we expect that our free cash flow from CLO distributions will be reduced. The worst consequence of this is that we just will deleverage our debt until the failed OC tests are back in compliance. Next, I want to spend just a moment on Wayzata, which is our market value CLO. This transaction is different from our cash flow CLOs in that under this facility when market values decline below a trigger, it does require us to post additional collateral. Wayzata allows for an approximate 5% decrease in market value before any collateral posting is required. If market value declined by more than 5%, then the entire 5% cushion must be replenished. To-date, we have contributed approximately $150 million in additional cash to this transaction. And as of November 7, our current cushion under the test was approximately $80 million. This means we estimate the assets financed through Wayzata can drop in value an additional $80 million before we have to make a choice about adding additional collateral. As you are aware, Wayzata is a non-recourse facility, and as such, if we choose not to add additional collateral, then the senior lender would foreclose on the assets held by the structure or held by the Wayzata facility. Additionally, Wayzata requires that a current net asset value test be met in order to receive cash distributions. If the net asset value is below this amount, then cash is trapped until the NAV or net asset value is in compliance with this requirement. Based on current asset prices, we would not receive cash distributions from Wayzata until this test is brought back into compliance. Similar to our cash flow CLOs, the assets held in Wayzata are performing very well. The bottom line is that with loan prices in the mid-70s, certain of our securitization structures are going to cease being cash flow generative to us until they either deleverage or until prices appreciate or both occur. Cash being trapped does not impact our available cash for operations, new investments and dividends. That said even if all of our CLOs and Wayzata cease generating cash for periods of time, we expect that we will have sufficient cash outside of these structures to service our debt and meet ongoing expenses. With that, I'm going to ask Jeff Van Horn to walk us through our quarterly results.
Jeff Van Horn: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $49 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share. Economic net income, which is GAAP net income adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense, was $48.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share. Similar to past quarters we have posted supplemental operating and financial information on our website today, which includes our economic income statement, per share valuation metrics, and information about our investment portfolio and financing. Our results for the quarter include realized losses from sales of investments, totaling $12.4 million and impairments of two equity investments, totaling $10.5 million. Our results also include a gain of $3.1 million related to the repurchase and retirement of $5 million of trust preferred securities. Our GAAP book value per share and economic book value per share as of quarter end were $11.47 and $12.05 respectively, as compared to $12.71 and $13 as of June 30, 2008. Our fair value per share as of quarter end, which reflects all of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value, was $13.85, as compared to $15.15 as of June 30, 2008. As of quarter end, our current quarterly net income run rate was $0.44 per share. We define run rate income as net investment income from our current portfolio less estimated non-investment expenses. Next, I'm going to hand the call back to Nino.
Nino Fanlo: Thank you, Jeff. Before we take any questions, I would like to close with a few remarks. We at KFN and KKR are committed to the long-term success of KFN. We think that the actions taken by KFN and KKR demonstrate our commitment to KFN during these challenging times. As I mentioned, we will continue to evaluate all strategic options to ensure we have the optimal business strategy the appropriate structure. As Dave and Jeff have indicated, our balance sheet is sound and provides us with a strong base to create long-term value for our shareholders. While the current environment is difficult, we will take the actions that are necessary to create long-term value. We will continue to strategically build on these actions, as we evolve during this difficult time to the new landscape of this challenging world. The economy is likely entering its severest recession since at least the early 1980s and possibly the '30s. Calm, sensible, reasoned investment decisions will serve us well in these difficult times. A good friend recently reminded me that tough times do not last, but tough people do. We at KKR and KFN shall persevere and move the company forward. With that, Laurie let's open it up to questions.
Laurie Poggi: Dustin, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will go first to Faye Elliott with Merrill Lynch. 
Faye Elliott - Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my call. Can you give us a sense of the level of income we could see including the cash that is being trapped, if it were to actually be the case through the rest of the fourth quarter?
Nino Fanlo: Sure, Faye. As Jeff indicated, our run rate, which is a GAAP figure, reflects what the earnings are. As Dave indicated, the amount of cash flow available is a function of the change in rating agency actions and the price of securities at any point. I think what Dave indicated was we felt very comfortable that regardless of rating agency actions and price deterioration, the firm had adequate resources to meet all its financial liabilities and expenses. And the amount of actual cash that would be available for distribution and further investment was a function of the price action. Dave, would you like to expand on that?
Dave Netjes: Yes. Just the last item say is whether or not cash is trapped in a structure for GAAP that has no impact on our GAAP earnings because for GAAP purposes the CLOs are ignored. So the only thing that impacts our GAAP earnings are if assets go on non-accrual status or obviously if we have asset that we charge off. But trapping cash will not have any impact on our GAAP run rate earnings.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Ballan with JPMorgan.
Jim Ballan - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks a lot. Can you talk a little bit about the pace at which capital is being returned to you, has that continued to slow? And, I mean, I guess for the assets that are in the CLOs that cash has either been reinvested or used to delever. But for the assets that are outside of the CLOs say that are in Wayzata, what are you using that liquidity for? Are you using it to pay downs Wayzata or holding onto that cash?
Nino Fanlo: I think we have to bracket the world into two worlds. Prior to the events of September 30, and the remarkable financial market performance of October, we were actively investing identifying new opportunities. And I would describe the world as it was as the way we had previously described, we were judiciously investing. In September and October, I think events took more control of themselves, and cash was being diverted for reserves against further price declines. And of course events continue to transpire. NRG just a couple of weeks ago received a takeover bid. And we believe that there will likely be a monetization. There has been considerable commentary about the FCC's approval of Verizon's acquisition of Alltel, which will generate cash. So the question you asked, Jim, about does cash continue to be created? The answer is of course it does continue to be created. But I would describe that the events of the past six weeks have certainly changed our normal operations. Dave, would you like to add to that?
Dave Netjes: Yes. I think the last thing, Jim, the reason it was so important for us to get this new revolver in place was the covenants under it give us much more flexibility to take advantage of the current market environment. Previously because we had a relatively tight tangible net worth covenant, Nino, myself, Jeff, Mike, the entire team we would sit down and see extraordinary investment opportunities, but that would require selling something that for GAAP purposes would generate a loss, even though the payback through increased returns on the new investment could be as short as 6, 12, or 18 months. And we were being hamstrung by the ability not to take advantage of that opportunity. That limitation became even more exacerbated as we went through the end of September and October, and we saw a bank loan sell off really precipitously. And we had to act on that so that we could take advantage of it. We've got $10 billion in CLOs. We shared with you what percentage the company owns. That stuff is in place at an average price of LIBOR plus 50 for the next nine years. The most critical thing for me, Nino, and the entire management team to do is to take advantage of the opportunity set we see here today. That means selling some of the credits with higher prices and taking advantage of the dislocation in the marketplace. Getting those covenants fixed is the first step for us to be able to capitalize on that opportunity. 
Jim Ballan - JPMorgan:  Great. One other question if I may. So you're not paying the dividend here in the third quarter. If the fourth quarter looks for the most part like the third quarter, would you be able to pay [dividend] in the fourth quarter or would that also be third quarter from a dividend standpoint?
Nino Fanlo: Yes. I think you broke out a little bit there, Jim. I think I understood it. If the fourth quarter looked like the third quarter, would our dividend actions be the same? First, importantly, this discussion and this decision is not a management company decision, it's a Board decision. So I would not want to speak for the Board. But I do believe that if you look at the effect of the markets and the deterioration of economic activity in October, I would not believe that the current environment is an improved environment that would lead to incremental risk taking. But again, I just want to be very clear that is a Board action and it is not up to management. I would not today on the facts that I had today recommend for any change in strategy from what you have just seen.
Jim Ballan - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go next to Don Fandetti with Citigroup. 
Don Fandetti - Citigroup:  Hi. Nino, your $100 million facility, I'm just trying to understand what is behind that. You say the manager and KKR Fixed Income. The part that is not KKR Fixed Income, I mean is there anything really behind that? I'm just trying to understand.
Nino Fanlo: I think you should look at the group that the world knows as KKR; the individuals, the partners, the organization that is what is providing the backstop facility. I apologize for the legal aspect of it. But it is the firm that people know as KKR to be the entity.
Dave Netjes: And Don, just so you are aware KKR Fixed Income is a subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the GP. So it is the GP as everyone knows it. 
Don Fandetti - Citigroup:  Okay. And then you had mentioned the potential of looking at bank acquisitions. A, can you talk a little bit about the potential opportunities there? B, you probably need some capital to finance that. It looks like you are capital constrained. So I am not sure how you get to that potential opportunity.
Nino Fanlo: Let me answer in a couple of elements. First, the landscape obviously since our last earnings call, there used to be a securities industry. There is none. I think you could argue that there was a specialty finance industry that wasn't deeply constrained. If general Electric is forced to get government support, then I think we have really changed the level of dynamics. So my remarks or our remarks I should say about the need to explore diligently, an institution that has access to regulated capital effectively is an essential element of our analysis and we will conduct it. With regard to the equity capital to invest in it, I think it is fair to say that we have assets today and capital that would allow us to at least make modest acquisitions. And we believe we continue to have both investors as well as interested parties that would assist us in that if we needed to.
Operator: We will go next to John Hecht with JMP Securities. 
John Hecht - JMP Securities:  Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys once again provide us with a list of your top 50 investments. I'm wondering, can you maybe give us a sense for what you might call the hard watch lister or the components of this list that you're taking a very close look at from a credit prospective?
Nino Fanlo: Let me answer that in the following way, John. By the end of the quarter, the watch list which, in future disclosure we might be able to provide further color, our constraints on that are that it may restrict our ability to make portfolio decisions, if other potential investors knew which assets we were moving in and out of. I can make the following remarks. Going into October, we did not believe there was any material change whatsoever in the condition of our watch list as it was at the end of the second quarter, and frankly, not materially different than it was at the end of the first quarter. Now Dave and I as a result of the economic deterioration that is coming through in the numbers of October have committed to the Board that we will take a fresh look at how all the companies operate in what will be undoubtedly I think the worst recession since the early '80s. And it will require a more thorough scrubbing of what those assets. We will in future [earnings releases] try to give a little broader color but we will always try to be careful to not restrict our ability to make portfolio changes by in effect telegraphing what assets we might be inclined to dispose of. 
John Hecht - JMP Securities:  Okay. In terms of the movement to the CLOs.
Nino Fanlo: I would like to make one more remark on that, John. We have previously described that the assets, or the impact that's has been felt to our balance sheet through P&L on SLOPs as well our OCI hits had been a fairly material hit. I continue to believe that through the third quarter, those figures were reflective of the risk that existed through the third quarter. 
John Hecht - JMP Securities:  Okay. And moving to the CLOs, can you give a sense of what is the overcollateralization requirements initially and where would it have to build to, and it sounds like it is a rating failure at this point in potentially three of your CLOs, and how long that might cash trap for assuming the assets don't prepay, just assuming normal course of business?
Dave Netjes: Sure. John, it depends on the CLOs, but for two of the CLOs, again it is not the payment date, but if we would apply the test on Friday, we are missing it by anywhere from $3 million or $4 million to $15 million or $20 million on two of them so we're relatively close. On the third, it is a larger amount. On the larger CLO if you took the cash that that throws off over a three- or fourth-quarter period and use that to deleverage, and you have to hold two things constant assume prices don't go up or don't get worse as the case might be. And you assume the relative level of ratings does not change materially that structured 2007-1 could be deleverage to the point where you are meeting the OC tests somewhere between quarters three or four. Again that is if you hold everything constant. If prices go up 3 or 4 or 5 points, it has a pretty material impact on the structure. And I would love for you to when you get time to stop by and we will walk you through that math.
Nino Fanlo: Yes. I would like to add it's the rating agency standards on this, there is a broad interpretation of what the terms are of a CCC. Those broad interpretations in conjunction with the extraordinary price declines, and it is really the price declines that have caused the challenges to this. So I just want to be very clear we had a horrible September, but really the damage in prices was really in October. And that is what has created the primary challenges for the CLOs. I do not believe nor have I met anyone yet who believes that the price action of October is reflective of fundamentals. So I have some hope that even if time goes by and the natural deleveraging, it will be further assisted by rational price increases.
Dave Netjes: Yes. And just remember as you know John, we have a bias towards larger global businesses that are relatively large. As there was a tremendous amount of deleveraging by the hedge fund community and the mutual fund community at September 30, and then after, those are the names that from a price standpoint suffered the most. And we have actually seen that stabilize over the last couple of weeks and start to turnaround. What we actually see happening now is the smaller less liquid names finally adjusting in prices. So we have reason to be mildly optimistic that the deleveraging that occurred at the end of the third quarter is behind us. That is not to mean that we don't expect to see a smaller wave here as we go through the end of the fourth quarter. But we have also seen a number of nontraditional participants jump into this market. Distressed folks are buying it. We continue to see private equity shops buy it. The asset class is extremely cheap and is drawing in many new investors. I think that will bode well for us given the fact that we're in the very large flow names. 
John Hecht - JMP Securities:  Okay. And then the last question is Wayzata, Dave you mentioned there is an $80 million cushion and then there is that, is that a market value test you're talking about in terms of the cushion or is that an OC test?
Dave Netjes: You can think of that as if prices went down on the instruments or the loans that are in that structure, aggregate prices could go down $80 million to $85 million without the need to put in additional collateral. Notwithstanding that comment, I can assure you Nino, myself, and others are in very productive discussions with the financing source on that transaction about ways to curtail market value risk going forward. We would love to turn it into a cash flow structure. We're having those discussions. We can't promise you that we will be successful. But we both have the same interests in line, I mean we have the right alignment of interest both us and the bank on the other side and that is in a very unprecedented market environment where prices are changing very rapidly, what's the best way to protect each other's interests. And those discussions are ongoing. So, John, we're not going to sit back and just wait for market prices to go down. We have other options including deleveraging Wayzata if we chose to do that, now that we've got the new revolver in place. So it is priority number two tied only with managing credit risk in our business.
John Hecht - JMP Securities: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Shanahan with Wachovia. 
James Shanahan - Wachovia:  Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. And I found the information about the credit performance of the corporate loan portfolio in the Q, it is still quite impressive. But it would be nice if you continue to publish that information in the slides. Just a comment. A follow-up, the $28.2 million in corporate loans that were changed to held for sale status, there was a charge there it looks like related to market value, why the switch? And is it your outlook for deterioration in that loan or maybe better execution today than in the future, is that the strategy?
Nino Fanlo: Mike, which are the 22 that you are talking about in held for sale? 
James Shanahan - Wachovia:  $28.2 million.
Jeff Van Horn: James, this is a small amount. It was a handful of loans we had traded just ordinary course of business, nothing unusual behind it.
James Shanahan - Wachovia: Thank you very much.
Operator: We have time for one final question. We will go to Douglas Harter with Credit Suisse. 
Douglas Harter - Credit Suisse:  Thanks. I was wondering to the extent that you are deleveraging Wayzata, how much of that $150 million that you have contributed could come out as you move it to the new facility or that all need to go to the new facility as well?
Nino Fanlo: I'm not sure I understood the question. What do you mean as we deleverage, pardon me? 
Douglas Harter - Credit Suisse:  You have said that as the prices have declined, you have had to put in $150 million of additional collateral into Wayzata. To the extent that you were to transition those loans over to the new facility, would you be able to free up any of that $150 million?
Nino Fanlo: Well, I think the Wayzata facility is still the most efficient way to finance those assets. I mean I think our borrowing base to be very clear will be substantially utilized today. So Wayzata remains the best place for those loans. And we have hoped that price appreciation will actually allow us to ultimately allow capital to be freed from that. Is that it?
Douglas Harter - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you.
Nino Fanlo: Okay. Is there any other question, Laurie?
Laurie Poggi: That is it, Nino.
Nino Fanlo: Okay. I just want to make a couple of remarks. Financials have been so clearly in the spotlight over the past 60 days, and embedded in all the price action and the concern is an understandable fear about what the environment has been. A number of companies took actions they regret. I will tell you today that KFN and what Dave and I and what our colleagues at KKR undertook was to employ a relatively conservative investment strategy with what we believed was a conservative financing strategy. We did not plan for the depths of challenges that a financial depression meant, but we will adjust to those. People in organizations matter in business. It is critical to our investment decision. I want to reiterate that although the industry is facing unprecedented challenges, we are absolutely committed to see KFN through this difficult period of time, rebuild and as our Chairman Paul Hazen tells live to fight another day and see the other side of this recession. And be prepared to take those advantages that will result from these difficult, difficult times. We thank you for your continued support. And we welcome at all times your interest in the company.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. We would like to again thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect at this time.
