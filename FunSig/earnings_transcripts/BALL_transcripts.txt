===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Potthoff, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Brandon Potthoff: Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2025 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are described in the company's latest Form 10-K, our most recent earnings release and Form 8-K and other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have the earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of non-comparable items as well as a reconciliation comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. References to net sales and comparable operating earnings in today's release and call do not include the company's former Aerospace business. Prior year-to-date net earnings attributable to the corporation and comparable net earnings do include the performance of the company's former Aerospace business through the sale date of February 16, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dan Fisher.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Brandon. Today, I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss first quarter financial performance and key metrics for 2025 and then we will finish it up with closing comments and Q&A. I want to take a minute and highlight the amazing work our employees and teams have done to give back to their communities. April was our global volunteer month at Ball and our employees volunteered more than 640 hours of their time across 11 countries, working to create a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. I want to thank all of our employees who devoted time in April to uplifting our communities. You truly represent our values of we care, we work and we win. Turning to business performance, we delivered strong first quarter results and returned $708 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend through today's call. This performance reemphasizes our opportunity to deliver record adjusted free cash flow and comparable diluted earnings per share in 2025. Aluminum packaging continues to outperform other substrates across the globe, demonstrating the resilient and defensive nature of our global business. While we remain mindful of ongoing uncertainties related to tariffs and consumer pressures, particularly in the U.S., we are confident in our ability to proactively manage these challenges and sustain our positive momentum throughout the year to deliver 11% to 14% comparable diluted EPS growth. In EMEA, First Quarter volume remained strong as our customers continued to move their package mix to aluminum cans. In South America, volume growth came in slightly ahead of our expectations driven by positive performance across each geography in which we operate. In North America, volume returned to growth despite a tough comp and economic pressure on the end consumer. Our regional performance culminated in Ball's global shipments being up 2.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. Looking to the rest of the year, our teams are focused on managing uncertainty, while leveraging the inherent resilient and defensiveness of our global portfolio. We remain laser focused on achieving our stated goal of 11% to 14% comparable diluted earnings per share growth in 2025 and are confident in our proven ability to execute through complexity and deliver value back to shareholders. We continue to anticipate global volume growth in the 2% to 3% range and expect all of our businesses to perform in line with or ahead of the targets outlined at our 2024 investor day. This reflects the strength of underlying global demand, the durability of our customer relationships, and the operational consistency of our teams across markets. In EMEA, we continue to expect mid-single digit volume growth in 2025. As the competitive advantage of aluminum packaging and low can penetration rates continue to drive share gains across the region. In South America, recovery in Argentina and Chile, coupled with anticipated growth in Brazil, is expected to drive volume growth above our 4% to 6% long-term range in 2025. In our North American business, higher than expected volume growth across non-alcoholic categories more than offset ongoing pressures in mass beer. We remain confident in our ability to deliver volume growth in line with or slightly above the market in 2025. While we are closely monitoring end consumer health, we believe the defensive nature of our portfolio combined with our strong customer alignment positions us well to navigate a potential economic slowdown. Lastly, on cups, during the first quarter, we announced the formation of Oasis Venture Holdings, a strategic partnership, which consists of the aluminum cup business, including its commercial, supply chain and manufacturing teams and the plant in Rome, Georgia. We are the minority partner and are excited about the long-term potential for the business under this new structure. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to talk about first quarter 2025 results as well as key metrics for 2025.
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan. Starting with our results, 2025 first quarter comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.76 versus $0.68 in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 12%. First quarter comparable net earnings of $216 million were driven by higher volumes, lower interest expense and cost management initiatives, which were able to nearly offset the earnings headwind from the sale of our Aerospace business and lower interest income. In North and Central America, stronger than expected volume performance drove 2% increase in comparable operating earnings on a challenging comp. Our team executed exceptionally well, successfully improving operational efficiencies, effectively managing the impact of the 232 tariffs and mitigating risk despite a volatile environment. Volume growth was largely driven by strength in energy drinks and non-alcoholic beverages. While we believe there may have been some modest pull forward of orders ahead of anticipated tariffs, we assess this impact as minimal. We remain attentive to the ongoing geopolitical landscape and tariff developments and are actively managing these dynamics. In EMEA, first quarter segment volume remained robust and segment comparable operating earnings increased 13%. Demand trends continue to be favorable, reinforcing our confidence in achieving significant year-over-year comparable operating earnings growth in 2025, driven by ongoing operational efficiency improvements and sustained volume growth. In South America, segment comparable operating earnings increased 25% supported by strong volume performance across all markets. We are encouraged by consumer conditions in Argentina, which continue to exhibit signs of recovery and the Brazilian market performed in line with our initial expectations, reflecting a stable operating environment. Our personal and home care business previously referred to as aerosol delivered mid-single digit volume growth in the first quarter. We remain confident in the strength of this business and continue to expect volume growth to exceed our long-term range in 2025. Moving on to additional key financial metrics and goals for 2025. We anticipate year end 2025 net debt to comparable EBITDA to be 2.75x. We will repurchase at least $1.3 billion worth of shares in 2025 and will remain aggressive in repurchasing our stock at what we believe is very attractive pricing. Through today's call, we have repurchased $651 million worth of shares year-to-date. 2025 CapEx is expected to be slightly below D&A in the range of $600 million We anticipate being able to deliver on our target of comparable net earnings equal to adjusted free cash flow in 2025. Relative to the estimated tax payment due to Aerospace sale, we expect the remaining portion to be paid in 2025. Our 2025 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be slightly above 22%, largely driven by lower year-over-year tax credits. Full year 2025 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $280 million. Full year 2025 reported adjusted corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are expected to be in the range of $150 million. And last week, Ball’s Board declared our quarterly cash dividend. Looking forward, we remain highly focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management and driving efficiency and productivity across the organization. At the same time, we are closely monitoring volatility in emerging markets and broader geopolitical developments. Thanks to the resilient and defensive nature of our business, combined with our proactive steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet, we are well positioned to navigate external uncertainty. With the clear financial runway and strong operational foundation, we are activating initiatives that we believe will enable consistent high-quality results and compounding shareholder returns over the long term. With that, I'll turn it back to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Howard. Our business is performing well and we have taken meaningful steps to future proof our operations through long-term contract renewals, strategic deleveraging and footprint optimization. Backed by the strength of our portfolio and the dedication of our teams, we are confident in our ability to achieve our financial goals of delivering 11% to 14% comparable EPS growth, generating adjusted free cash flow in line with comparable net earnings and returning substantial value to shareholders through large scale share repurchases and dividends in 2025. As we focus on execution in 2025, we have the opportunity to deliver record adjusted free cash flow and comparable diluted earnings per share. While external volatility has increased since we last spoke in February, particularly around tariffs and geopolitical dynamics, the resilience of our global footprint and our defensive business model give us confidence in our ability to navigate a wide range of outcomes. We remain committed to meeting our customers where they are, providing affordable, innovative aluminum packaging solutions that support a world free from waste. Creating shareholder value remains our top priority. With the combination of consistent operational performance, disciplined financial management and significant share repurchase alongside dividends, we are confident we can drive meaningful compounding returns for shareholders in 2025 and beyond. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. Thank you. And with that, Christine, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Hey, good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Good morning, Dan and Howard. I guess first off in Europe and the consistency of volume growth there, obviously outperforming pretty much every other geography on the planet pretty consistently over time. Can you just sort of frame for us your supply position there? Where are you from a utilization standpoint? And where do you think the next leg of incremental growth will come from? And then separate to that, was there any sort of pull forward that you could think of as it relates to that region specific to cross-border shipments from Europe to the U.S. ahead of tariffs?
Dan Fisher: The second question first, I would say no minimal, Ghansham. How to characterize Europe for us, obviously we made a couple of pretty significant investments a couple of years ago, built a big facility in The Czech Republic, built a big one an hour outside of London. In both cases now we've got third lines moving to invest the fourth lines in both. So we're growing at a nice rate. We've benefited from having made those investments and so we're able to scale those up. We will be getting -- it's getting tight across Europe. We're going to have a little bit more out of pattern freight in peak season. You know this industry well, given such a hot start we had and such a hot start everyone had. So we're in a good spot. We like the trajectory of the back half of the year. We think there'll be continued growth going into '26 and '27 and we'll be looking to do some things hopefully incremental, nothing significant and everything has been contemplated in terms of our CapEx to D&A envelope. So, probably a higher priority on Europe for some incremental investment, nothing significant, certainly cautious to make sure that supply demand stays in balance and that's a marketplace where the labor laws, you got to get it right, you have to maintain real disciplined structure there.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, got it. And then as it relates to North America, you seem a little bit more, or at least you have confidence as it relates to your growth relative to the industry for this year. Going back to the analyst meeting from June of last year, all the self-improvement initiatives you outlined there to boost etc. Can you just give us a sense as to where those are tracking relative to your initial plan and how is that starting to reshape your sort of baseline as to operating leverage as volumes do start to come back this year in that region?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I don't expect margin expansion. Our ability to maintain what we have, I think is probably a better characterization of North America. And 2023 and 2024 a lot of heavy lifting in the NCA region, where we are starting to see some improvements are in Europe and in South America in terms of some of the lean initiatives that are rolled out. Obviously, we had to do things quickly from a fixed cost standpoint in North America and we're further along in the journey in North America in our Ball operating excellence in our Ball business system. So you should see continued improvement and I think with the efficiency gains in places like Europe that may enable us to spend less capital, but to step into the growth moving forward.
Ghansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Staphos, your line is live. Perhaps you have yourself on mute. Our next question comes from the line of Stefan Diaz with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Stefan Diaz: Hi, Dan, Howard, Brandon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to begin, if you could just give us a little more details on how you're thinking about tariffs and the potential impact on demand? And maybe if you could particularly touch on your Mexico beer exposure and maybe what are you hearing from your customers there, just given the extension of tariffs to cover the value of beer cans?
Dan Fisher: Yes, maybe I'll start more broadly with North America. The 232 that was rolled out mid-March excuse me that's intact, not a lot's changed. I think that's been well publicized. Think about that in terms of $0.075 to $0.01 to can impact. That's really negligible in the grand scheme of economics. The [indiscernible] has come off, so I think the total deliver economics, it's really not much. One particular customer that I think you mentioned that's in our portfolio, they are compliant with the MCA. So yes, they have the 232, but they're not experiencing much of any tariff impact coming across the border. And so for us right now, strong start to the year, still continuing to see a -- I've got a very constructive outlook on North America, albeit uncertain. Demand relative to the Chinese tariff impacts is the one thing that is probably not agnostic to -- it's consistent across every industry. So that's the one we're looking at, but we haven't seen it. We haven't seen any different behavior from our customers. We haven't seen any forecast change. I think the only thing that we're keeping our eye on kind of relative to the segment that you identified is there's certainly been ongoing challenges for brands or categories that are attached more broadly to the Hispanic customer, because they are not as visible commercially right now for a million reasons and some of them pretty political. So we're watching that, but even with that, that's been fairly persistent here throughout the first quarter and hasn't impacted our volumes to a degree in which we would alter our outlook for the year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more context in how we're seeing it.
Stefan Diaz: Yes, yes, no, that's very helpful and nice to hear that you're not really seeing an impact to your volumes from that so far. Maybe just sticking with North America, I understand you have less exposure versus peers to non-alcoholic beverages, but how are you thinking about the potential cuts to SNAP? And how does this come up in conversations with your customers at all? And if it has, what are they saying about it?
Dan Fisher: Yes, on the non-alcoholic side of things, they're constantly reformulating those offerings to make sure that it finds a home, right, with the varying dietary concerns and or I guess the chemical challenges facing things like GLP etc. So I think they are reformulating products, they are launching new products, all of those seem to be meeting the customer where they're at. I'm not overly concerned with some of the things you're talking about, the Make America Healthy initiatives. Yes, I think it's still going to boil down to economics and right now I think most of the large CPG customers that are in those areas are reformulating and innovating in an interesting way, in a faster market way that is enabling and we continue to grow.
Stefan Diaz: Thanks, Dan. I'll turn it over.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Dan, hey, with volumes, I think a little bit better than expected, I'm wondering if you could kind of characterize the promotional environment in your major markets as we get closer to the summer. Do you think customer promotions have been more successful than you would have thought or are they moving the needle on volumes or are there particular sizes or formats that are winning in the market or just any color there?
Dan Fisher: Yes, in North America particularly, right? Yes. There have been some -- if you look at the Energy segment, there have been more innovation in and around flavor profiles and a more deliberate effort to price things to move them. That's been much more constructive and you're seeing that in the Energy segment returning to mid-single digit, high-single digit growth. We had had enough conversations with folks in that segment to know they didn't like where they were back in the fourth quarter and second half of the year in terms of the growth trend. So I think they made a conscious effort there and they're seeing that. Non-alcoholic in general, I think there's been enough innovation in that segment along with again more constructive pricing to drive volume. You haven't seen that on the beer side, but I also kind of left '24 headed into '25 and are thinking and are planning there will be much more conscious effort in peak season to see some activity in and around pricing to drive volume. So, we're still anticipating some of that, but writ large and in my comments, non-alcoholics ahead of where we thought even with some of the planned innovations and the plan thinking to push volume and beer is a little behind. So I think more of the same and non-alcoholic and a little bit more aggressive pricing to push volume and beer and that sets up for a pretty healthy year for the industry.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just following up on that, I mean on the last earnings call you announced the purchase of Florida Can. Can you give us sort of an update on that and especially just how that asset kind of fits into what seems like a little bit of a stronger North American market?
Dan Fisher: Yes. We'll need that. We'll need the capacity. There's a couple of can sizes that are getting real tight. Unfortunately, that asset does have those capabilities. We'll see more of that impact moving into peak season. You see less of it now, right? Obviously, we're still building inventory getting ready for peak season. So you haven't needed to spot volume opportunity or the additional incremental growth that that presents, but you'll start to lean into it. And as you said, getting off to a good industry start means we'll need that capacity sooner rather than later. It's ready to go. The assets are running. It's fully staffed. It's been integrated nicely into our system. So now it's to your lane there, yes, I mean we're looking forward to using that and running it full out here this summer.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Strong quarter and start to the year, so congrats. Volumes in North America was pretty strong, especially a tough comp from last year. Curious, how's the summer season been kind of shaping up in North America, order trends in April, May? The reason why I ask is because the brewers have still been calling pretty soft trends in North America and I think you called out some modest perhaps pre buy. So does that kind of soften your demand trajectory, call it 2Q and perhaps the back half of the year?
Dan Fisher: We're still seeing really positive constructive start here to April, I guess we're in May now. We didn't see much pre buy just to be clear, maybe others called out a bit of that from the beer side, we didn't see that. What I'm hopeful for and it kind of builds off my last question is we started we entered 2025 with pretty strong belief that non-alcoholic segment energy in particular, they were going to innovate and they were going to go for volume. They were going to kind of moderate pricing in line with CPI, maybe even take a little less than that and go back and get that category to growth and I think they've done a nice job at the start industry wide. The rest of the non-alcohol category has innovated. They've done nice as well. They've been really constructive on their pricing to push volume, meet the customer where they are from an affordability lens. And then beer, I still think there's going to be significant effort here in peak season to moderate price levels so they can move product. I don't think anybody is happy where mass beer is here through the first quarter. And I'm not surprised, they're going to use the affordability lens and push that. And so more to come here in peak season, I'm cautiously optimistic if they can do that, we'll be a little ahead on the non-alcohol and if that can catch up to be remotely in line with what we thought at the beginning of the year, I think it bodes for a really nice industry performance here over the back half of the year.
Phil Ng: And is it realistic to assume low-single digits in North America in the next few quarters this year still?
Dan Fisher: Yes, that's what we're -- we thought we'd do a little better kind of for us in particular, we thought we'd do a little better kind of Q2, Q3 versus prior year. And we got out a little ahead in Q1. So if that can maintain persist, I think you're in that one to three range for industry and I believe we'll be right there. Obviously, we have a little bit more weight on beer, but we also have a little more weight on Energy. So those two things have netted out to be slightly more positive than we anticipated at this point in the year.
Phil Ng: That's great. And then Europe certainly sounds like it's getting tighter. Is that an opportunity for pricing and as the kind of next contract kind of set up? And then similarly in North America maybe we're a little further away, but I think two of your competitors called out North America potentially getting tightening as well, especially in the summer selling season. Is that an opportunity for you perhaps to pick up some share because I suspect you among your bigger competitors in North America probably have a little more spare capacity. So, is that an opportunity during the peak summer months?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Let me start with Europe First. Europe is -- when you look at the construction of the margin profile in Europe, everybody makes good gross profit. I mean, it's the best in the world. So pricing is not really the opportunity set and then of course it's not Europe, right, it's the U.K., it's Spain, it's there's a little bit more I think there's balance and there's solid competition in each one of these siloed regions if you will, sub regions within Europe. So we'd much rather prefer growth on the existing margin in Europe and we'll try to make it up through efficiency gains. If we're going to expand margins, it will be rolling out kind of all business systems and becoming better operators throughout the throughout Pan Europe. In North America, we're pretty tight. So we took out an awful lot of capacity. We did add the Florida Can assets. We do have some 12-ounce capacity still hungover from kind of the Bud Light Challenge if you will, but not a lot. We've tightened our system and it's reflected in our current margin profile. So I would say we've got opportunity to grow at the rates we've outlined without adding capital. Obviously, we're going to put the new facility in the Northwest that should free up capacity in the Southwest. So, we've contemplated the next two to three years having what we need in order to step into the growth algorithm we laid out at Investor Day last year, but there's not a ton of upside, maybe some spot pricing opportunities, maybe some spot market opportunities, having the right mix, having the right can size, those things could present opportunities for us, but not a bunch of excess capacity to step into.
Phil Ng: Okay, great color. Really appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I mean, Dan, a quick one. So you mentioned the 11%, fourteen % EPS growth for this year. Can you get there if volume falls short because of tariffs or are there other levers you can pull to get to that growth number?
Dan Fisher: It's a great question. I guess how far will volume fall, I guess would be the question. We're feeling really good about the low end based on what we see today. Here's how we're looking at tariffs right now. Very constructive start to the year. We know what 232 is. Our customers know what 232 is. Our suppliers know. We're managing that. The wild card will be the ongoing shock and awe strategy, how quickly does that translate into real identifiable trade deals. I think once we see one or two trade deals show up, it starts to really enable us to frame these scenarios and work a problem set that's identifiable. So, I'm hopeful that a couple of things are going to break loose in the next 30 to 60 days that we're going to know Japan, maybe Korea, Vietnam, things like that. You raised a good point on China that could be challenging, ongoing, but I think we're optimistic that we're going to start to see get some tea leaves here about what's really going to be in front of us and then we've done a pretty good job with some significant challenges here over the last two to three years to manage those in a real constructive manner. And so I think that's right in front of us. So I think this uncertainty dissipates. And it's uncertain today, but I think that window closes. And then the reality is we haven't been able to talk about this last couple of years, but this is a aluminum packaging. If people are going to spend less going out, if people are going to spend less traveling, etcetera, we typically do well. We're resilient in a recession. We're not inflationary resistant, but we're resilient in a recession. If that's where we're headed, depending on how steep it is, I think the range still holds, obviously higher to get to the top end. But then the counter or the positives would be a weaker dollar. Our fastest growing business or most profitable business is Europe. There's some currency tailwinds there. So I think as we sit here today that's exactly the conversation I had with the Board last week. It's like I'm feeling like we're in this range and we can navigate it. Yes, I've got a lot of belief in the performance of the team after the last couple of years and what they can do. If we can have an identifiable problem, we typically sprint after it and solve it pretty effectively.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Spector: I wanted to follow-up on the North and Central America segment. You had, I mean, low single-digit volume growth and you had kind of similar, little bit lower EBIT growth. I know last year there was some pull forward. So really just trying to think about the underlying EBIT growth that you had in that segment and you pretty consistently have talked about 2% to 3% volume growth in that segment for the rest of the year. What's the type of EBIT leverage we should expect there to go forward? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think it will be closely -- we think about the two in one ratio is enterprise-wide less region-by-region in terms of that leverage factor. You can have mix impacts quarter-to-quarter, you can have a number of other things manifest as you know. So I think we'll be kind of holding our earnings profile margin slight uptick in total comp dollars and some of this will just be mix related for the back half of the year on how much we go up.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Dan Fisher: Hi, George. Yes, we thought we lost it there for a second, buddy.
George Staphos: Yes. It happens. It happens. I appreciate the time and the details. So three questions. One, Dan, you mentioned earlier in the call, you're activating initiatives and I just wanted to sort of peer under the hood there if there's anything specific to that or if that's just a continuation of Ball Business Systems and the effect it's having on operating leverage. Secondly, you talk about you don't think there's been much pre buy and certainly we take that face value, but where you sit, where Howard sits, how do you ever know how much pre buying may happen unless it's after the fact? So like how do you know to be confident about it being a minimal effect? And then last question, I'll turn it over. This is my phrasing not yours, but you seem cautiously optimistic about your beer customers being a bit more, I don't know what the right term would be, but more promotional getting price points optimized. What gives you the comfort, the confidence about that heading into the season realizing at the end of the day you're their supplier and they're ultimately going to market how they market? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Right. So great question on the pre buy. No, we can't slice and dice this info. It's it would be conversations. It would be looking at order patterns versus scanner data, trying to factor out anomalies. I would say there's more thought than licking the finger and putting it in the air, but I think you're on to something. It could be I mean it could be a couple of hundred million George. We think it's somewhere in that kind of $100 million to $200 million and there was a little bit of pull forward last year as well. So minimally on a comp year-over-year, not a lot of delta, but that's probably the extent of the analysis. It's a good call out. We know that some of our customers too that were shipping over the border because their volumes were already dissipating in the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter. They were pretty full up on inventory. So there wasn't an ability to pull forward as much. I would have expected to see it from a couple of customers that I had my eyes out. We were asking those questions here over the last three to four weeks, but they were their volumes were already coming off, right. So they didn't have a whole lot of warehouse capacity or distributor capacity to kind of stuff the channel further. Those are the factors of the nuance that gets me to this. And we're not with everybody. And so there could very well be some pull forward in the overall market place. But from what we saw in our numbers, not a great deal to speak to at this point.
George Staphos: Okay.
Dan Fisher: And then just honing in on similar, we're in front of our customers quite a bit. We have a lot of conversations. I don't want to give too much away, but I do think a couple large brewers, I think they've even said in some of their investor discussions like, hey, we want a more concentrated effort when people are going to be attending barbecues and such and we'd rather spend our marketing dollars there. Now, in fairness, that doesn't mean there's going to be affordability price lens, but typically when I hear that a more concentrated effort, there is some combination of more public facing marketing and a base effort to move volume during that period. So that's where it's coming from. Those are the things I've heard fairly consistently and that makes sense. I don't know why you're trying to push product in dry January. Maybe there's something there. Maybe there's something there. There was one other question that I think you wanted me to hit on, sorry.
George Staphos: You said during your remarks that you're activating initiatives and I just wanted to probe exactly kind of what that was referring to. Is that just the benefits of what you've been doing with Ball Business Systems or is there something specific there whatever you could share? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, George. Yes, nothing more than just ongoing rolling it out. It's going to take us 18 to 24 months to roll it out across every plant. I think we're about 2/3rd of the way there at this point. We started with safety, quality. There were some obvious things we did from a capacity standpoint but we're seeing significant improvements in safety, significant improvements in quality. We had a number of record production weeks and days during the first quarter. So we get this rolled out over our entire infrastructure and facilities. I think you'll see the consistency of performance and a lot of positive knock-on effects. So we're just leaning into that more fully. It's built into a lot of our thinking already. So I wouldn't say there's anything incremental, but steady progress on kind of what we described at our Investor Day a year ago.
George Staphos: Thank you very much, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think in capital expenditures in the quarter you spent $80 million. Can you get all the way to $600 million. Why was the spending so low in the beginning of the year and why should it be much higher later in the year?
Howard Yu: Yes. So, Jeff, I think with regards to the Northwest facility that Dan had specifically talked about, I think that we're moving slower there. And so you will see that ramp up in the tail end of this year. And so what we said is that $600 million is probably the high end of that in aggregate. And we'll look at things and depending on how things shape up throughout the year, we may moderate. But at this position, we see the funnel for CapEx and what we want to do including some of the maintenance work that's required as well. And so, we'll lean into that a little bit more as the year goes.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. And secondly, your inventories jumped from the fourth quarter to the first quarter by about 10%. Is that just a seasonal number or is there something else going on?
Dan Fisher: Yes, it's just a seasonal number. It's a good question. It's in line with what we expected to start the year. The inventories were lower. At the end of the fourth quarter, volumes were so soft at the end of the year that we've rebuilt and we're seeing the strength in across all the markets in terms of volumetric outlook. So I think we're positioned right, it's not heavy, probably had some benefit in terms of some absorption relative to the prior year, but kind of in line with what we expected nothing out of the ordinary.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Roxland: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Niko Pacini on for Mike.
Dan Fisher: Hi, Niko.
Michael Roxland: Just first off, moving back to maybe margins in North and Central America. I think EBITDA margins are around like 17% right now versus mid-teens maybe a few years ago. At the same time, CPGs are being squeezed upon some continued volume weakness. And then on top of all that, you had some favorable pricing a few years ago when supply demand was tighter. Can you just comment on maybe your expectations for margin sustainability going forward in light of that and as contract negotiations come up in the next few years?
Dan Fisher: Yes, we're at a kind of a high-water mark, in our North America margins. To sustain these, given the backdrop that you described, I think every one of our CPG customers is talking about affordability and an affordability lens. We're already meeting them in long-term planning sessions, joint planning sessions to figure out more efficient routes to market, more efficient ways to deliver the product. We're going to have to do quite a bit to help our customers make their margins and push product and advertise and promote. So we're going to have to play a role in that for sure moving forward. But I think what we've been able to do thus far is kind of over deliver on focusing on our core, the Ball Business System, the efficiency gains we're seeing, more constructive footprint. So all of those are playing a role. I would suggest that, yes, volumes are to come by right and it's probably coming at a different price point for our customers. And I think if we're the partners that we ascribe to be then we'll participate in that moving forward and that's why I've been pretty consistent on can we maintain these margins and that's certainly our goal.
Michael Roxland: Perfect, understood, very helpful. Just follow-up there, I think some of your peers have been speaking about mix -- specialty mix in North America versus standard cans. Just wondering what you are seeing in specialty cans and if you are adjusting your mix at all and if there is any margin impact there?
Dan Fisher: There is a little bit of I think 12 silks growing at a very healthy clip. So depending on whether you call that special or not, I think that would be nomenclature definition, but that will play a role. And then the most affordable package when you start thinking about how some of the beer folks are playing, precisely to your previous question, 12-ounce cans, you can run a lot of them, you can fill them quick, you can package them in cubes very nicely. So I think 12 standard cans in this environment may play a bigger role. And so I think that affordability lens. There's ways to play it in terms of efficiencies throughout the system. That's one. Certainly, on the beer side, I think you're seeing more and more of that play out. But still specialty category 7.5 ounces growing very nicely, 12 silks growing very nicely, 24 ounces is continuing to grow. So specialty continues to grow, but I think depending on what segment, what brand you're looking at, what channel playing this affordability lens, I think different pack mixes and different size, different price points are important as well.
Michael Roxland: Got it. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Can you just hit a little bit more on the trends that you're seeing in Latin America? Obviously, it's been a fairly volatile few years, but just how should the Street generally be thinking about not only in the second half of '25, but into '26, '27 of both the Brazilian and it seems like Argentina has calmed down a bit? Thank you so much.
Dan Fisher: Sure. Yes, Chris, we entered the year Brazil was inflation was running a bit hot entering '25 and our belief was sort of 2% to 3% growth in Brazil was about right for the industry, seems to be playing out that way. We were a little under that in the first quarter because our partner down there didn't win in the marketplace. So mix played a role in that. But the rest of our portfolio, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina, all of those countries are recovering and all of them were up nicely. And so when I talk about getting to in excess of our long term 4% to 6% growth rates in that region, that's how we're going to get there in '25. And there should be a knock-on effect for some nice growth in line with our long-term goals for '26 as well. Getting out ahead of my skis in the '27, the contracts are all there, it's just going to be what's happening from a macro standpoint in South America, but we like the back half of '25 and '26 and the recovery of these countries that as you frame in your question were much softer the last 18 months.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, just turning over to Europe. Europe generally, I think it's been surprising in the demand side, obviously, there have also been some puts and takes. But just intermediate term, how should we be thinking about just the supply demand dynamics across the region and how are you personally thinking about that over the next year, year and a half or so? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes, it presents more growth than North and Central America because the substrate shift away from glass. It presents close to the growth rates in South America, but of course off a bigger base. So the volume will be of a size and scale that will be bigger than South America. And capacity adds and you can even see it if you go back and look at what we did when we added facilities, we added one in the U.K., we added one in The Czech Republic. These are much friendlier labor markets and labor pools. And so I think you just have to be mindful of where you're building. It's harder to build in Europe, zoning, permitting, water, wastewater treatment, all of that. It takes longer and you have to be incredibly constructive about your views over the next 20 to 30 years. So there's always been a bit more discipline if you will of not betting on the come to some extent. And so I would expect the industry thinks that way as well. But I mean, I don't want to stem the growth. I think it's coming from a we're at the high 20% now of substrate mix. It should go to if it's anywhere like the rest of the world, it goes somewhere between the mid-40s and low 50s. So it's a decadal shift that we're experienced and undergoing in our customers whether they're non-alcohol, energy, alcohol, they also see the same thing. You just have to be very planful and methodical about putting capital in the ground there, probably much more so than anywhere else in the world.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong Q1 there. I guess, first off, just on the price mix, so you guys did a little bit better than what we thought in all three segments. And it looks like definitely price mix played a good role there. But would you say your outperformance from on the segment EBIT perspective was kind of equally split between slight volume outperformance, price mix and strong execution in running well or was one of those factors maybe more contributory and I guess do you expect that to continue?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think pretty consistent operational performance. I wouldn't say there's much of an uplift there. So, we've been at this in North America for a couple of years now. Probably a little bit more on the mix side of things, more so than the volume, the volume is probably enough to offset to some extent the inflationary pressures that you're experiencing. And then favorable mix and a little bit of operational efficiency is how you would have flown through a bit more profit.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, great. Thanks Dan. And then you mentioned that the Florida Can has been integrated and will be running full out. So I guess I'm just curious on the contracting and filling up that facility and maybe even your others in North America. How long are your contracts now? Are they still kind of maybe in the year or so level? What's your visibility on the volumes over the next few quarters? And I guess, do you look at sell through or do you look at kind of contracting to achieve that visibility? Is it necessary that you see a full sell through of cans that you sell to your customers or is it contracting that's more important or maybe both, I don't know?
Dan Fisher: Yes, contracting is the most important over the medium-term period and planning your assets, supply demand, scanner data coupled with inventory, getting a handle on your customers, their inventory, safety stock levels and also you're needing to know that from their relationship with their retailer. You have to have all those connected in order to really have an understanding of what the volume is in the quarter-to-quarter sense that I think you were pressing. And then the only other thing I would say just specific to Florida Can would be, I said we'll run it all out here during peak season. So that's good. Yes, there's still like there's still and there's definitely capacity in shoulder seasons in North America. Yes, so it will be product specific and it will be peak season. You'll be able to step into potentially some spot opportunities, but right now we're almost there and peak season, so we're running.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, that sounds good. Right. And so just putting that together then, you still feel confident in your volume outlook for the full year in North and Central America. Is that correct?
Dan Fisher: I do for what's in front of us, yes.
Arun Viswanathan: Got it. Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yes. You bet.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Fisher, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I appreciate everyone's question and time and look forward to seeing you here and hopefully a more certain and less noisy second quarter update.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks].

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Potthoff, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Brandon Potthoff : Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter 2024 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are described in the company's latest Form 10-K, our most recent earnings release and Form 8-K and other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have the earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of non-comparable items as well as a reconciliation comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. References to net sales and comparable operating earnings in today's release and call do not include the company's former Aerospace business. Year-to-date net earnings attributable to the corporation and comparable net earnings do include the performance of the company's former Aerospace business through the sale date of February 16, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dan Fisher.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Brandon. Today, I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss fourth quarter financial performance and key metrics for 2025 and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. Before I talk about the business and results, I want to highlight the amazing work our employees and teams have done to give back to their communities. In 2024, our employees volunteered more than 23,000 hours of their time across 23 countries and to more than 1,880 different causes and organizations, working to create a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. In partnership with the Ball Foundation and our dedicated employees we invested more than $4 million into our communities to support local causes and disaster relief efforts. I want to thank all of our employees who devoted time in 2024 to uplifting our communities. You truly represent our values of we care, we work, we win. I also want to take a minute to highlight the work our teams have done to continue to improve our safety performance. Because our people are our most valuable resource, we set aggressive targets to improve our total recordable incident rates. We continue to be well below industry incident rates and our continuous improvement mindset requires us to constantly improve. Through that mindset, we were able to decrease our 2024 incident rates versus 2023, and outperformed our goal for the year. For us, our safety metrics represent more than just numbers, they exemplify the health and well-being of our employees, and we will continue to do everything in our power to improve every year. Turning to business performance. We delivered solid fourth quarter results and returned $1.96 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2024. And we continue to execute on our goal of repurchasing at least $3 billion of shares between 2024 and 2025. Aluminum packaging continues to outperform other substrates across the globe. In EMEA, fourth quarter volume remained strong, driven by continued investment by our customers in can filling across the region. In South America, volume growth in Chile and Paraguay was more than offset by softer-than-anticipated volume performance in our Argentina as well as supply/demand tightness in Brazil caused by slower-than-expected ramp of idle capacity. In North America, persistent economic pressure on the end consumer and our exposure to U.S. domestic beer led to softer-than-expected volume. Our regional performance culminated involves global beverage can shipments being down low single-digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 1% in 2024. Looking to 2025, our Ball Business system is in place, and our teams are focused and excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us to drive operational performance, volume growth, and productivity gains. We are laser-focused on delivering on our stated goal of exceeding 10% comparable diluted earnings per share growth 2025 and beyond. As we begin 2025, we feel confident in our ability to deliver 11% to 14% comparable diluted EPS growth. We anticipate growing global volume in the 2% to 3% range and expect all of our businesses to grow in or above the ranges we laid out at our 2024 Investor Day. In EMEA, customer movement to cans from other substrates will continue in 2025. We continue to be bullish on the opportunity to drive long-term growth across EMEA as sustainability legislation and the competitive advantages of aluminum packaging increased can penetration from a low base. In South America, recovery in Argentina and Chile, coupled with growth in Brazil, is expected to drive volume above our long-term range and operating earnings growth in in 2025. And while our North America business faced volume challenges last year, we have confidence our ability to deliver volume growth in line with or slightly above market. We have been proactive about extending contracts and have over 85% of our 2026 volume under contract. That includes signing an extension with one of our largest customers that will take us to nearly the end of the decade. This extension with our global partner also means that we will be building what is effectively a two-line can plant in Oregon. This investment will not change our expected CapEx plans or our share repurchase targets and will give us needed capacity in in the market where our customers are also investing. Additionally, January, the company entered into an agreement to purchase Florida can manufacturing and its beverage can facility in Winter Haven, Florida. The transaction, which carried a $160 million purchase price closed this morning. Our North American business is running at high utilization rates in part of the U.S. and with the growth we expect in the coming years, this capacity will provide us the fuel for growth we need to deliver on our customers' plans. We are purchasing this asset for well below replacement value. And with our strong balance sheet position, there will be no impact to our share repurchase plans. Lastly, on cups. During the fourth quarter, our Board approved for the company to pursue alternatives for the business. This includes an option to form a strategic partnership in early 2025, which is expected to result in deconsolidation of the business. We expect to complete the process in the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard to discuss full year and fourth quarter 2024 results as well as key metrics for 2025.
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan. Starting with our results, 2024 full year comparable diluted earnings per share was $3.17 versus $2.90 in 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.84 versus $0.78 of the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 9.3% and 7.7%, respectively. Full year comparable net earnings of $977 million were up year-over-year, driven by strong operational performance, cost management initiatives and lower interest expense, which were able to more than offset the earnings headwinds from the sale of our Aerospace business. Fourth quarter comparable net earnings of $250 million were up year-over-year, driven by cost management initiatives as well as lower tax and interest expense, which were able to more than offset the earnings headwinds from the sale of our Aerospace business. In North and Central America, stronger-than-expected performance in December volumes was more than offset by lower-than-expected volume in October and November. Despite a softer US mass beer category and stretched end consumer, we continue to believe that our 2025 volume will return to growth and will be in line or slightly above market. Throughout 2024, our team has done a great job of improving operational efficiencies, lowering cost and effectively countering measuring risk. And through our Ball Business system, we will continue to drive operational improvement in the plants to more profitably serve our customers' growth. While we have a tough comp in the first quarter as well as headwinds from poor weather across the US in January, we expect sequential improvement throughout the quarters, leading to volume growth in 2025. In EMEA, fourth quarter segment volumes were strong, and the segment comparable operating earnings increased 12.5%, matching our expectations entering the quarter. Recent demand trends remain favorable and the business is on track for significant year-over-year comparable operating earnings growth in 2025, driven by improving operational efficiencies and volume growth. In South America, segment comparable operating earnings increased slightly, while segment volumes declined due to continued weakness in Argentina and the supply-demand tightness in Brazil, partly offset by volume growth in Chile and Paraguay. During the fourth quarter, consumer conditions in Argentina continued to demonstrate some gradual signs of recovery, and we continue to monitor the dynamic economic situation in Argentina and potential scenarios that could impact results. To provide additional volume support for our Brazil business, we plan to reopen [indiscernible] facility. Looking at the businesses within our Other. Our Personal & Home Care business, which was previously called Aerosol performed well and grew volume mid-single digit in the fourth quarter, and we expect to grow volumes above our long-term range in 2025. Moving on to additional key financial metrics singles for 2025. We anticipate year-end 2025 net debt to comparable EBITDA to be 2.75 times as we work to deliver on our stated goals of repurchasing at least $3 billion worth of shares between 2024 and 2025. After repurchasing $1.7 billion of shares in 2024, we will repurchase at least $1.3 billion of shares in 2025. And we'll remain aggressive in repurchasing our stock that what we believe is very attractive pricing. Through today's call, we have repurchased $290 million worth of shares year-to-date. 2025 CapEx is expected to be slightly below D&A in the range of $600 million. We anticipate being able to deliver on our target of comparable net earnings equal to adjusted free cash flow in 2025. Relative to the estimated tax payments due on the Aerospace sale, we now expect total payments to be $875 million. We paid a total of $766 million as of the end of the fourth quarter and expect the remaining portion to be paid in the first half of 2025. Our 2025 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be slightly above 22%, largely driven by lower year-over-year tax credits. Full year 2025 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $270 million. Full year 2025 reported adjusted corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable as expected to be in the range of $160 million, driven higher by lower interest income from the cash proceeds of the Aerospace sale. And last week, Ball's board authorized the repurchase by the company of $4 billion of our common stock through the end of 2027 as well as declared its quarterly cash dividend. Looking ahead to 2025, we are hyper focused on operational excellence, cost management, driving efficiency and productivity across our business and monitoring emerging marketing volatility. We are fully committed to maximizing the potential of our company over the long term. We have executed on derisking the corporation through debt retirement, and we have minimal near-term maturities. The runway is clear for us to activate near-term initiatives to consistently deliver high-quality results and generate compounding shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Dan.
Dan Fisher : Thanks, Howard. The business is operating well, and we have future-proofed our business through long-term contract renewals, deleveraging and footprint optimization. Through the strength of our portfolio and the unwavering dedication of our employees, we are confident we will deliver on our long-term financial goals of exceeding 10% comparable diluted EPS growth, generating adjusted free cash flow in line with our comparable net earnings and returning value to shareholders through large-scale share repurchase and dividends. The focus on executing our purpose and our promise was certainly on display during 2024. In 2025, we have the opportunity to deliver record adjusted free cash flow and comparable diluted earnings per share. We will continue to meet our customers where they are to deliver affordable, innovative aluminum packaging solutions that can lead to a world free from waste. Shareholder value creation remains our focus, and we continue to prioritize delivering compounding shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond. We are confident that consistent delivery of high-quality results operational performance, coupled with a significant share repurchases for the foreseeable future, in addition to dividends will drive shareholder value creation. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and everyone listening today. Thank you. And with that, Christine, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Thank you. Hi everyone, good morning. Thank you for the details guys. I guess, first question, recognizing there's been delays to what extent have you been able to determine the effect of tariffs and what that might have relative to the guidance that you're providing, either in terms of volume and/or supply chain on aluminum? For instance, if there is some impact on Mexican shipments might that be made up in North America or not? And then I had a couple of quick follow-ons.
Dan Fisher: Yes, George, great question. I'm on a call every single day and the details, obviously, are changing relative to tariffs. I think maybe start with what is imminent is what's happening to the aluminum supply chain in China, and we have spent the better part of the last few weeks mitigating what started as a potential $40 million to $50 million issue. And I think we've got that resolved down to millions of dollars, a couple million dollars. So, we've renegotiated deals with the supply base. We've enforced elements of our of our contract, a lot of that metal was going into South America actually because a lot of these supply chain -- metal supply chains have been altered significantly back in the 2015 and 2016 timeframes. So, that one -- you can put that one to bed as it having minimal nominal year-over-year impact to us. But the I think what you're highlighting is our concern would be depending on the size of this or the piece coming across the border from Mexico, it would be really end consumer additional pressure there in volume. The good news is some of the stuff that comes across the board for Mexico is the growing aspect of your beer portfolio. Obviously, we've been in constant contact with some of those customers. And we've got plans in place to help risk mitigate, but if it's 25%, that's a vastly different story than a 10% versus the 2.5%. And the 25% to me would be more concerning than in terms of a pretty stressed end consumer. So, I would be more concerned about the volume for that aspect of the portfolio, which is not that big for us, but stuff that I know in detail. We've worked, we've mitigated it. The other stuff is still in flight. The 25% number would be more be more concerning and it will concerning relative to end consumer demand, which would certainly dampen our current outlook.
George Staphos: That's clear, Dan. Thank you for that. And the other question, and it's a two-parter. Can you talk about -- I'll try to make it painless. Can you talk a little bit about how these investments you talked about, including the Florida can business might affect your earnings and/or volumes? In other words, would you have been comfortable with the growth outlook you gave, if you weren't making these investments? Or do you need these to get there? And then just, look, having covered the company for a while, like a lot of folks on this call. The last few years, Ball has been very busy. But at times, sort of getting to the bottom line, the investments, the activity has not been necessarily as you would have expected. And so what comfort would you give analysts and investors that you can manage another can plant, you can manage investment and at the same time, executing get to the bottom line to hit your goals. Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thanks. I think if I'm following that triannual. I would just say that, guess, over the last couple of years in North America, we've significantly outperformed on earnings. So I guess I'm struggling with some of the -- some parts of the question, but I'll answer this in terms of...
George Staphos: Dan, I mean going back to the can plant additions from the growth boom and how that came through in terms of earnings. That's where I was going with that. I'm sorry, but -- and clearly, you definitely did get great operating leverage the last couple of years. But that's what's going with that part of the question.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Well, the investments have more than paid for themselves by restructuring aged assets that were less productive. So all of that, I mean, if you look at that, it's actually worked out pretty well. The two investments that we have, one, I've said repeatedly that we didn't want to abandon the Northwest marketplace permanently. So that one shouldn't come as a surprise. It's in line with investments by our customer in that part of the world. So it's repositioning that footprint to be more closely aligned to their investments, so that should work well moving forward. So a lot of thought in that application of investment there and then picking up a significantly reduced price point on a great plant that's nearby an existing Tampa facility in a market that's growing, we're going to really like that in 2026 and beyond.
Howard Yu: I think, George, maybe just one thing to add is that, that that Northwest investment that Dan is talking about, that would still be within our envelope of CapEx that we've described. And so our CapEx in 2025 will be below D&A and despite that investment in the Northwest. And so I wanted to make that clear as well.
George Staphos: Okay. And do you need these to hit your goals or these would have been additive to the goals you gave? Thanks, guys.
Dan Fisher: Additive than in 2026.
George Staphos: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Volumes in North America…
Dan Fisher: Hey, good day, Phil.
Phil Ng: Good day. Volumes in North America has been anything but predictable, it's been weaker. But you sounded pretty confident North America will grow faster than market and faster than your longer-term target. So I guess, first out of the gate, what are you seeing? And then you called out contract renewal with one of your larger customers in North America, which is Greg gives you visibility to the out years. Did you pick up any volumes? And how should we think about pricing for those contracts that you guys renew?
Dan Fisher : Yes. I would say 2025 let me start with that piece. I think the industry is expecting kind of that 1%-ish growth rate. For us, obviously, we were lapping 2023 pretty significant marketing dislocation. And then last year, we had a sizable share reallocation on one of our major beer partners. So we're stable heading into this year some incremental volume pickups and it's going to boil down to held the end consumer. Are you with the right customers with the right partners from a mix perspective? So I believe we are. So that's why I'm more bullish that will tick a little north of how the market performs. And then relative to pricing, fairly stable in the out years relative to the large customer contract that we picked up. Some of that obviously when you're making investments on behalf of those customers, you're able to offer a different value proposition. So that's created some structure and some stabilization for us relative to that customer.
Phil Ng: Any share gains in volumes picked up as part of that that investment, that customer?
Dan Fisher : We believe we picked up, I would characterize it this way. I think where we have secured volume, we believe that it will be growing at a faster rate than their portfolio given some of the pressure, for instance, in the Northwest on some anti-plastic sentiment.
Phil Ng: Okay. Super. And then when I think about, Dan, how you've historically been aligned globally and certainly North America as well, you guys have been in line with the big brands, big customers. And when I think about North America, frankly, there's been a lot of innovation in the beverage industry. And a lot of that is actually coming from smaller brands and entrepreneurs, whether it's ready-to-drink cocktails, non-alcoholic beers and actually non-alcoholic beverages on that ready-to-drink side functional soda and stuff of that nature. So my question to you is, how is your growth to market strategy perhaps evolving? Are you going after some of these customers in a bigger way just because demand has been pretty muted in North America and the concern has been, is this a structural dynamic you can't grow out of. So how your go-to-market strategy pivoting in an evolving marketplace where there's still a lot of innovation out there?
Dan Fisher : No, I think that's a great comment, Phil. Historically, I mean, we're kind of with everybody in the marketplace. Our portfolio is exponentially larger than any of our competitors in terms of the customer and the category mix. We've got a pretty healthy balance across everything. It's interesting, you commented on ready-to-drink cocktails. So, one of our bigger customers actually acquired the brand that owns 40% of the ready-to-drink cocktail. So these two things, generally, if they're really successful innovative launches, they typically get acquired. So, you've got -- you have to play candidly, you have to play kind of who are the acquirers, who are the innovators. You kind of start there with your anchor investors and then you work both sides of the equation to help stimulate product launches. And so the copies of the world, the liquid depth, this is like they're large in our portfolio. So, -- but it's hard to -- if Coke is growing and ABI is growing and the large customers are growing, we're going to grow. If they're not growing, you can have all of the startups in the world and you're just not going to move the needle on the size of volume. So, there's definitely a balance. I don't think we've moved away from innovation driving sustainability with -- and helping the smaller innovation-driven brands and customers in the marketplace. But at the same time, you got to help make sure that your key partners are winning in the market and that's really how you're going to win.
Phil Ng: Okay, Dan, really appreciate the color.
Dan Fisher: Yes, thank you, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey guys, good morning.
Dan Fisher: Hey morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Dan, going back to the Analyst Day from June of last year where you spent a fair amount of time on some of the productivity initiatives that were going to unfold over a multiyear basis, largely North America. And to put that in just kind of given what you've done or have announced with Oregon and also the acquisition in Florida, does that allow you the opportunity -- a bigger opportunity as it relates to reconfiguration of your footprint and to reaccelerate that productivity because it's not like volumes are growing faster in the industry relative to those two additions?
Dan Fisher: Ghansham, I think these -- once these are in place, yes, you'll be able to pick up efficiencies. We didn't vacate demand, for instance, in the Northwest, so you're shipping in. that that demand. So, will be a benefit, right, in terms of delivered cost. And then it's -- we're acquiring an incredibly efficient asset base down in Florida that we can do some things relative to running different can sizes and then becoming more efficient on lines within that subregion. So, we just closed the deal today. So, we've got some ideas on what we're going to do, but we're going to have to get in there and do that. But yes, that will -- any time you've got incredibly efficient assets, well-run assets, that gives you opportunity to be more flexible in a system of our size.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, perfect. And then as it relates to Europe, obviously, Europe was a very nice surprise, I would say, for the industry from a volume perspective last year. How are you thinking about 2025 as it relates to volume growth, tougher comparisons and just the fact that it is Europe?
Dan Fisher: Yes, as we sit here today, like we thought we'd be entering into -- 2023 fourth quarter, there was the destocking event that took place, which muted volume, then everybody got off to a pretty good start in the first quarter. So, I thought the comp would be a little bit more challenging this 2025 versus 2024, because of that sequencing of events and we're off to a really good start there. So, I think it's just -- listen, we've always talked about the opportunity set that Europe presents because it's got the lowest can penetration and as it evolves into a focus on carbon footprint, we've got a great product for that. It's a glass-rich environment in Europe, as you know. And I think the health of the end consumer to some extent, is a little more balanced in terms of our customers, not necessarily being able to put through price at the same rate with the same velocity that they're able to in North America. And as a result of that, I think -- it's a really stable environment for continued growth. And we're fortunate that we put in place a couple of large assets there to grow into, and we're continuing to grow into those. So, I think we'll be at the high end of our long-term guidance for Europe again this year.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stefan Diaz with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Stefan Diaz: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first, going back to North America, do you need to see low single-digit volume growth to be able to hit your EPS guide? Or can we sort of have like a flat to down environment in 2025 and still grow earnings? Just considering the shares you're buying back? Or maybe is it just as simple as if you grow 2% to 3% globally, you should be able to hit your EPS guide?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I'd say for a negative print on volume that looks like what we did this year, I think we'll be very challenged to hit EPS target even with share buyback at a more aggressive rate. A flattish environment, offset by maybe a little bit more growth in Europe, I think it's probably a good recipe to deliver the range we outlined. But yes, we're getting to a point where you're going to need some growth in North America. It's not only profitability associated with the volume growth, it's also really hard to offset negative volume of productivity gains. At some point, we're a volume business. We've done a lot of heavy lifting and done some tremendous things to increase the level of profitability in North America. But you'll start running into a bit more of a challenged environment relative to North America and then you'll have to rely more on mix and some other things to steer you to a heavier profitability lift there. But yes, I'm feeling really good where we're at right now starting the year. Things are pointing in the right direction with the strength of Europe and the event that things don't materialize in the growth in North America, but certainly growth is going to at some point, be an important cog, if not necessary to expand margins.
Stefan Diaz: Okay, perfect. No, that's really helpful. And then so the last couple of calls now, you noted a supply/demand mismatch in Brazil. So, I guess, how are your inventory levels in the region? And maybe how has demand shaken out versus your expectations so far quarter-to-date? And then maybe if you could also just parse out Brazil volumes in the quarter versus Argentina volumes, just so it's easier for us to compare versus your competitors? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Sure. So, Brazil grew in the fourth quarter, we didn't. I would say we entered into -- we're managing certainly the downturn in Argentina aggressively from a cost perspective in the second and third quarter. We were doing the same thing in Chile, which has been soft and has declined for the last two or three years. And then Brazil was low single-digit growth for the first two quarters. And we also were running a much tighter capacity outlook within our network there. And then suddenly, it got really hot at the end of Q3. So we entered -- were tight and running short on inventory positions at the end of Q3. We started turning on a curtail line in Argentina, curtail line in Chile, multiple curtailed lines in Brazil. And as we said in the opening, we're turning back on a curtailed plant, but that's just taking longer than we anticipated. So we'll return to growth in Q1 and will grow in excess of our long-term outlook next year because we're seeing recovery in Chile. We're seeing recovery in Argentina, we’ll be fit to serve Brazil and will be coming off a much easier comp, obviously, in Q3 and Q4, 2025 versus 2024.
Stefan Diaz: Great. Thank you. I’ll turn it over.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: In previous quarters, you've been able to grow EBIT year-over-year without much volume growth. And I guess that changed in 4Q. I'm just wondering, did you I don't know, lap any key cost saves? Or were there any kind of PPI pass-throughs or change in price mix. I guess, maybe you lap the Wallkill plant closure. But just curious if there was anything that drove that leverage?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I think you're talking specifically about North America.
Anthony Pettinari: Yeah.
Dan Fisher: Yeah, we've done -- listen, we're running to historical assay utilization rates now. So we've done the heavy lifting over the last couple of years. So we've lapped that. So in many respects, what you're describing is, yes, we're going to have to get a little bit of growth. I think, the new investments that we're making will also give us an opportunity to create an even more efficient supply chain with the Florida can investment in particular. So there are things that we can do now that we have that asset in the portfolio. But yeah, we're tight. And we're also obviously shipping products, as I indicated to an earlier question, into the Northwest. So there's inefficiency relative to that. That will lap once we get new facility up in Oregon. So there's opportunities there to do some more and gain productivity. But turning on curtailed lines and running them is going to be the most efficient way to lever up margin-wise.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it, got it. And then can you maybe talk about operating rates or system utilization in Europe? I guess, volume growth has probably been ahead of other regions, but I don't think you've added a lot of capacity in recent years. I'm just wondering if there's anything in the CapEx plan for 2025, 2026 for Europe or opportunities for debottlenecking or new lines or anything like that.
Dan Fisher: Yeah, we have – I guess, over the last two to three years, we've added two huge facilities, one in the UK and one in the Czech Republic. So we've been -- those will both be 4-line plants, by the end of next year. So we have done some incremental line enhancements and investments and that's been able to lift us. It's getting -- it's actually getting quite tight all throughout Europe right now. Over there's a lack of capacity to meet the demand in the UK, so we're looking at things there. But yes, that's -- if these growth rates continue, I mean, it's a big market growing at 3%, 4%, 5%. So that would -- that's going to require probably think about 2027, 2028 to be doing other things in that part of the world.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Roxland: Thank you, Dan, Howard and Brandon for taking my questions.
Dan Fisher: You bet.
Mike Roxland: Just wanted to talk to you about the competitive backdrop. There have been some concerns out there in North America anyway, the pricing could be a risk later this year, early next year when some big contracts come up for renewal. Obviously, then you addressed one of them, as you mentioned, you got that extend to the end of the next decade or this decade, excuse me, I should say. But just trying to get a sense from you as to what the competitive environment is like, particularly given softer demand maybe some competitors looking to gain share. And I think in a recent conference, you also called out as the Midwest, in particular, as being somewhat challenged. So any color you can provide would be very helpful.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think I've been pretty consistent on this, Michael. As you know, there -- when you look at the number of facilities that were built, there was quite a few facilities built in the upper Midwest, Northern Kentucky region. And the demand growth has really been on the coast in the Southeast and Texas. So there are reasons for those builds. I think there were a lot of subsidies that went into those builds. But they're not necessarily positioned for the demand profile moving forward. With that said, we're tight. We've structured our asset base in a way that has enabled us to being tight, but also be very close with our strategic partners to make sure that we're doing the right things for them, medium and long-term. That was rewarded in the contract renewal. Relatively speaking, the pricing that we're seeing is better than the past 20 years minus the pricing that we were securing during a massively undersupplied marketplace. So they're really healthy margins to make money and flow cash and manage. They could potentially not be as good as what we were looking at three years ago. I'm talking about incremental differences, not meaningful differences. But I think we're happy with what we're securing and at the prices we're securing and we think we can grow and expand margins based on that and flow really nice cash.
Mike Roxland: Got it. I appreciate the color Dan, thank you for that. One quick follow-up. Just in terms of beer, obviously, category is still lagging. We're still trying to figure out the SKUs, the mix, how to target both premium and discount without getting stuck in the middle. How far along do you think the beer companies are in this process? And I'll throw it out there, when do you expect beer demand to inflect higher? Any sense when that could ultimately target?
Dan Fisher: Honestly, I don't know the inflection. I would expect it would be very aggressive behavior in the peak season coming up in North America. Starting to see -- you even saw one of our customers today in a non-alcohol range there. The pricing is not enough to grow the top line. So I think once they start hitting these price elasticity curves where they cannot grow the top line, I think behavioral patterns will change. I think some -- some of the plans I've seen, I'm encouraged. I really do think it's going to be what customer or what partner you have is going to matter. Obviously, some of the folks that had really nice growth trajectory. They're dealing with tariffs right now and they're dealing with that make sense out of that. I think that will continue to grow medium and long term because of the relationship they have with the population growth that prefers those products. And then others, I think, are going to get more focused on their portfolio. There's going to be some new innovation that comes out and the folks that have struck a nice balance between being a beverage company and being a beer company, those are the ones that I believe will win medium and long term. And think we have overweight to them. That's a great question. When are we going to see it? The end consumer is obviously still weak. You're in the dry January portion of the year. So no surprises here that you see softness in the beer side right now. Things start to pick up here. Right now, with Super Bowl week and then beyond that, heading into spring break weather patterns, that will all be important to see pricing behaviors and I think, hopefully, a return to volume growth being the principal driver of their economic decisions.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Thank you very much for the color and good luck in 2025.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: I have two semi-related questions. First, Howard, just a quick housekeeping. I think the release states you plan to deconsolidate cups starting in 2025. I think in the past, you've talked about the being about a $40 million drag. So is that a $40 million earnings tailwind as we think about 2025 year-over-year?
Howard Yu: Yeah, Mike, I think it depends on when we're able to get to a full agreement here as it relates to the joint venture structure. As it is today, those losses associated with cups are still flowing through right now in the quarter and so timing matters here. If we assume that we had talked about $40 million historically and we go through the first quarter, get this transaction done, and it's probably somewhere around the $25 million that we'd see improvement year-over-year.
Mike Leithead: Okay. That's great. And then second, on the share repurchase, if I do the math, it's about $1.3 billion, I believe, of repurchases this year, which today is about 8.5% of the company. So is cups and buybacks, the largest drivers of the 10% year-over-year EPS growth? Or just how should we think about for beverage can earnings growth compared to 2024?
Howard Yu: I mean, I think we're going to see some. Obviously, operating earnings growth is going to matter. When we talked about the algo, certainly -- Dan talked about the North America maybe a little bit of challenges there. But we feel very good about our growth profile, both in terms of volume and the leverage associated with operating earnings in EMEA as well as in South America. We're bullish on Argentina and the green shoots that we're seeing there, the macro are going to improve. And so I think that there's no reason to believe that we're not going to be able to achieve that healthy algo in that region as well. And then as you said, I mean we are going to have a significant amount of share buyback and the like. One thing to keep in mind is that we will see less interest income this year because with the proceeds associated the Aerospace sale, we had over $42 million of interest income that won't repeat year-over-year.
Mike Leithead: Got it. Thank you guys.
Howard Yu: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Dan Fisher : Good morning.
Edlain Rodriguez: Quick -- I mean, big picture question, Dan. I mean, in terms of now you have questions that whether beer or alcoholic drinks, might be bad for your health. I think somebody has said it's dangerous for you. So at the margin, this will make some people think twice about ranking alcohol being included. So of all the things that you think about, that keeps you awake at night, is this one of them? Is this -- should this be one of them? Like any thoughts there would be appreciated.
Dan Fisher : You're probably asking the wrong guy, because I enjoy my alcohol.
Edlain Rodriguez: You and me, both.
Dan Fisher : Yes, yes. I really don't. We -- I think we've known it's probably not at moderation everything. I mean I don't want to go down this path with you. But the thing that keeps me up at night right now is the health of the end consumer in North America. That's what keeps you up at night. All of this other stuff is noise. And that's what I'm hearing from our customers as well. So until which time I can sit through a return to some normal spending patterns by the end consumers. I -- this stuff is really -- it's on the radar as it should be, but it's not -- we're not losing sleep over this. This is not going to in the next three to five years, create a challenge for us and the slides. In fact, beer, you're counting beer growth everywhere else in the world. I mean, if beer doesn't grow, then we're not growing in the can. So doesn't seem to be a concern in other parts of the world, but it seems to be a focus of a lot of conversation in North America. So it's dislocated in that sense. Yes, I wish I had a better answer for you, but...
Edlain Rodriguez: No. No, that's good enough. And just a follow-up in terms of the share buyback. I mean, of course, the share price has come down quite a bit over the past couple of weeks, months. Like what are you thinking in terms of the pace of the share buyback? You just should we be thinking like more aggressive in the near term or just going to be like more disciplined systematic throughout the year?
Howard Yu: Edlain, I think you've seen our behavior here, and I think I indicated even earlier that we bought back $290 million worth of shares in a month plus. So the answer to your question is, yes. We see this as an opportunity for us to be overly aggressive perhaps. And with the value of the stock, we're going to lean into that here in the short-term. Certainly, recognizing that we'll exceed -- likely exceed the $1.3 billion worth of shares here in 2025.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
Dan Fisher: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Can you just us a little bit more color since you went over the beer thesis on what you're seeing in energy markets, in particular, in both the U.S. and Europe. There's been a lot of noise over the last six to 12 months, so just hoping to hear kind of the best updates there as well? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think Europe is probably pretty easy. Our Europe energy portfolio is growing at high mid-single-digits. So, -- and that has continued to perform that way for the last five, six, seven years. So, not a lot of change on that front. I think in North America, there are tiers to the energy drink classification. One product, I think one of the larger products, it's definitely tied to Hispanic population, the construction industry. And so interest rates matter to that particular product. Others have different effects, the end consumer though matters. Now, what we're seeing kind of right out of the gate is more aggressive pricing, and we're seeing growth through January in the Energy segment. So, I think there -- they're in a place where they have a lot more price, I think, to work with relative to their products to push for growth in some instances, and I think you're going to see that, a much more competitive baseline to grow volume and grow share, which is good. I haven’t seen the same behavioral pattern in beer. But Energy looks to be an area where I think you'll have a return to growth in 2025, in North America, and it will maintain growth at similar rates in Europe.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. And just in terms of your -- the longer term South American algo putting, let's put Argentina aside for a second, there's been a lot going on once again in terms of customer -- or let's say, industry bankruptcies to a few rain carnivals, post-COVID all that stuff. When you take a stance right a year right now, heading into 2025, how much confidence do you have in that growth rate, at least in Brazil and forecasting that aluminum should still be the primary substrate -- versus glass and everything else? Just any comments there would be also very helpful. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes. We're -- we believe that there will be growth in Brazil in the kind of 2%, 3%, 4% range next year. But for us, we'll grow in excess of 4% to 6% because Chile has returned to growth, Paraguay is growing at double-digits, Argentina is returning and inflecting the growth. So, we've got some -- where we had unfavorable comps this year, we'll have favorable comps next year in those economies. And Brazil will actually grow at a slower rate than we will because of our portfolio. But we believe Brazil will grow, but to your point, it's probably a little bit more muted than what you saw this year.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you.
Dan Fisher: You bet. We'll do one more question, Christine.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you guys are well. Maybe I could just get first your thoughts around these two beverage can plant acquisitions. Could you provide maybe your thoughts on ROIC or payback period, if there's any synergies? What can those two can add to your outlook over the next, say, two to three years, maybe from an EBITDA standpoint, if at all, or free cash flow? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I think the -- so we're only acquiring one. The other one would just be a new facility. So we began in growth, volume growth that we can't serve today in the Northwest, and then we be positioning the supply closer to the customer. So probably $20 million additionally a year back half of 2026, most likely beginning of 2027, and we'll hit a $25 million to $35 million EBITDA run rate in the beginning of 2027 for the Florida can acquisition. So about a four-year to generate a positive EVA.
Arun Viswanathan: That's great. Thanks, Dan. And then just back to the beer question. So it sounds like there is I mean, I can appreciate the large customers of yours could acquire some nice growing properties. But what are they going to -- what is it really going to take for them to accelerate beer, because as you said earlier and throughout the call that if you're not growing very globally, it's going to be difficult, especially in North America. So is it something where they can take a leadership position within the category? Was that done in CSD? Is it going to require some new beverage development? Or what do you think -- and what are you hearing from them as far as ways to really energize that growth profile?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. In beer specifically, so I guess there's beer volume writ large and there's beer in cans. So I still like our ability to move up straight needle over time. In the baseline, and that's -- we've been growing in beer for a decade plus. So a lot of it has to do with substrate. But then when you look at portfolios, there's certainly been disaggregation from having too many too large of a portfolio, so really moving to a more efficient delivery of brands that they believe are going to win with an affordability lens on that. And so we're helping to make sure that we have a more strategic supply chain. But in the -- if you look at the largest brewer in the world, I mean, their portfolio, they have the largest ready-to-drink cocktail. They have the fastest growing domestic like beer. So there are -- I think you're really have to look within these portfolios, what they're doing, what they're going to do? And do you believe in that trajectory? And how can help play a role in that. So I think innovation matters, I think you'll see an investment in a lot more non-alcohol moving forward. It's not going to be a surprise to see that. But when you find a winner, I think -- and it might be I just look -- I look at these traditional beer players as beverage companies, and they've got to get that right because they own the distribution patterns, they own the shelf space to a large extent. And so they got to put things on the shelves that are going to sell. And there's a greater likelihood that it's going to be in a can than any other format. And so that's sort of how we're thinking about it. But the beer question, I think that's the right question, but does it have to be beer.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Christine. We'll leave it there and look forward to talking to you again here at the end of the first quarter. I hope everybody stays safe and healthy.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Potthoff, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Brandon Potthoff: Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2024 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made today. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are described in the company's latest Form 10-K, our most recent earnings release and Form 8-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of non-comparable items as well as a reconciliation of comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. References to net sales and comparable operating earnings in today's release and call do not include the company's former aerospace business. Year-to-date net earnings attributable to the corporation and comparable net earnings do include the performance of the company's former aerospace business through the sale date of February 16, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dan Fisher.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Brandon. Today I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss third quarter financial performance and key metrics for 2024. And then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. Before I talk about the third quarter, I want to take a moment to recognize our team in Tampa, Florida, who have shown incredible resiliency while dealing with the impact of 2 devastating hurricanes. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by these terrible storms. We are fortunate that all of our employees are safe and that our Tampa facility avoided major damage and was back up and running quickly. The Ball Foundation supported critical relief efforts by providing monetary donations to organizations with teams actively supporting impacted cities. And in conjunction with customers, we donated over 250,000 cans and bottles of drinking water. Our thoughts remain with the communities impacted by these terrible storms and we will continue to support our employees, customers and communities through our global employee giving program. I would also like to welcome our new colleagues who recently joined Ball following our October 29 acquisition of Alucan Entec, a European extruded aluminum aerosol and bottle technology leader. As the demand for sustainable aluminum packaging continues to grow among customers and consumers, this transaction is a capital-efficient way to add incremental capacity to expand our extruded aluminum aerosol business in Europe, while also allowing us to serve the growing extruded aluminum beverage bottle market and diversify our customer base across the continent. Turning to business performance. We delivered strong third quarter results and year-to-date have returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends as of today's call. Reflecting further on year-to-date 2024 performance, aluminum packaging continues to outperform other substrates across the globe. In EMEA, third quarter volumes remained strong, driven by continued investment by our customers in canned filling across the region. In South America, softer-than-anticipated volume performance was driven by our exposure to Argentina and supply-demand tightness in Brazil. In North America, persistent economic pressure on the end consumer and our exposure to U.S. domestic beer led to softer-than-expected volumes. Our regional performance culminated in Ball's global beverage can shipments being essentially flat year-over-year in the third quarter and up 2% year-to-date. For a complete summary of regional shipments for the third quarter, please refer to today's earnings release. Consistent with our previous commentary and given our customer mix and year-to-date regional volume performance, we now anticipate full year global shipment growth in the low single digits range. Key drivers for our company's performance in 2024 continue to be the benefits of deleveraging, repurchasing shares, improving operational efficiencies and leveraging our well-capitalized plant assets to grow the use of innovative, sustainable aluminum packaging across channels, categories and venues. Based on our current demand trends and the previously mentioned drivers, we are positioned to grow full year comparable diluted EPS mid-single digits plus of 2023 reported comparable diluted EPS of $2.90 per share, generate strong adjusted free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and return a value in excess of $1.6 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to discuss the quarter and key metrics.
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan. Turning to our results. Third quarter 2024 comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.91, versus $0.83 in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter comparable net earnings of $278 million were up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to strong operational performance and price/mix, leading to improved year-over-year performance in North America, EMEA and South America. In addition, we had lower interest expense. In North and Central America, segment comparable operating earnings increased 4% and were in line with our expectations despite a softer U.S. mass beer category and stretched end consumer. Benefits of effective cost management and plant efficiencies across our well-capitalized plant network more than offset for the impact of lower volumes. Our team has done a great job improving operational efficiencies, lowering costs and effectively counter-measuring risk. And in future years, when end customer demand inflects more favorably, we are set up to more profitably serve our customers' growth. In EMEA, overall segment volumes were strong and segment comparable operating earnings increased 24%, matching our expectations entering the quarter. Recent demand trends remain favorable and the business is on track for significant year-over-year comparable operating earnings growth in 2024 driven by improving operational efficiencies and volume growth. In South America, segment comparable operating earnings increased 28%, while segment volumes declined due to continued weakness in Argentina and supply-demand tightness in Brazil late in the quarter. During the third quarter, consumer conditions in Argentina demonstrated some gradual signs of recovery and we continue to monitor the dynamic economic situation in Argentina and potential scenarios that can impact results. In Brazil, strong demand in the month of September outpaced our ability to service that demand. We remain bullish about Brazil and our ability to deliver year-over-year comparable operating earnings and volume improvement as we enter the summer selling season in South America. Looking at the businesses within other, the aerosol business performed well and operating earnings were helped by insurance proceeds received during the quarter. The can plant and beverage packaging, other were in line with our expectations and we continue to see growth opportunities in India. Lastly, while our cups business slightly improved operating earnings year-over-year, the growth of this business has not been at the level we initially expected. And as a result, the company is currently evaluating various options for this business. Moving on to additional key financial metrics and goals for 2024. These reflect very consistent figures to those provided throughout the year. We continue to anticipate year-end 2024 net debt to comparable EBITDA to be below 2.5x. While we are currently at 2.2x at the end of the third quarter, net debt to comparable EBITDA may nudge slightly higher by year-end as the company continues payments of tax due on the gain from the sale of aerospace. 2024 CapEx is on track to be in the range of $650 million, a year-over-year reduction of $400 million and largely driven by carrying capital elated to prior year's projects. We remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow target. Share repurchases are expected to be in excess of $1.4 billion by year-end. Through today's call, we have repurchased approximately $1.2 billion in shares year-to-date. Our 2024 full year effective tax on comparable earnings is expected to be slightly above 21%, largely driven by lower year-over-year R&D tax credits associated with the sale of the company's aerospace business. Relative to the estimated tax payments due on the aerospace sale, we have paid a total of $484 million as of the end of the third quarter and we now expect our total taxes on the transaction to be in the range of $950 million. Full year 2024 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $300 million. Excluding the non-comparable aerospace disposition compensation costs, full year 2024 reported adjusted corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are expected to be in the range of $100 million. And last week, Ball's Board declared its quarterly cash dividend. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we remain laser-focused on operational excellence, driving efficiency and productivity across our business and cost management and monitoring emerging market volatility. We are committed to maximizing the full potential of our company over the long term. We have executed on de-risking the corporation through debt retirement. We have no significant near-term maturities. The runway is clear for us to activate near-term initiatives to consistently deliver high-quality results and generate compounding shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Howard. The business is operating well and we have line of sight to growing our 2024 comparable diluted EPS mid-single digit plus. While the consumer backdrop remains volatile, we will remain disciplined and through the strength of our portfolio and the unwavering dedication of our employees, we are confident we will deliver on our commitments laid out at our Investor Day. We are focused on executing our purpose and our promise was certainly on display during the third quarter. By the care and support we have provided our employees, customers and communities, by enabling the greater use of aluminum packaging with our bolt-on aluminum aerosol acquisition and by working together to deliver strong results, operating efficiencies and the consistent return of value to shareholders to ensure we win together over the near and long term. We will strive to deliver innovative aluminum packaging solutions that can lead to a world free from waste and continue down the path to deliver compounding shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. Shareholder value creation remains our focus. And going forward, we anticipate exceeding 10% per annum diluted comparable EPS growth, including in 2025. Consistent delivery of high-quality results and operational performance, coupled with significant share repurchases for the foreseeable future, in addition to dividends, will drive shareholder value creation. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. Thank you. And with that, Christine, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George Staphos : I guess the first question I had regards the operational excellence work that you've been doing. And what might you have seen year-to-date, what might we see either in absolute terms or sequentially into 4Q and then into 2025? And what I'm really trying to get is, is there any sort of incremental catalysts that we might be able to see from the cost side given that things are pretty much status quo on the top line both in terms of volume and price/mix?
Dan Fisher: Yes, George. I think you'll see for the next couple of years a continuance of sort of 2% to 3% of our cost structure, is what we're trying to drive to in terms of an overall goal of productivity. Now there's a chunk of the aluminum that's built in there that's tolled, which you really don't have a great deal of ownership on how to drive productivity there. But the teams are continuing to fill the funnel with projects and build on that. I think the simple way to think about it, George, is we are planning better. By planning better, that results in less conversions and less turnover of label changes. That creates less spoilage and less overtime. And so those fundamental ratios got out of whack during COVID. We've taken some of the higher-cost, less-efficient assets out. So you're seeing that first wave of productivity gains back half of last year and into this year. And then the second half of this year and into next year, the manifestation of really this operational excellence, lean, standardization, continuous improvement. But they're going to come through those primary factors. And a little bit of volume will go a long way in also improving that and improving our leverage flow-through. I think you can see we're making more money on a per can basis through a lot of the actions we've taken. I think we can maintain that, offset inflation, offset merit increases and maybe even margin up a bit more moving forward. In North America specific, my comments are really about getting the volume breeds more tailwind and leverage and it also enables us to step into these efficiency gains where it really shows up in those areas. And then further down the road, it enables you to grow, absent capital investments at the rate we've seen historically. So that's how we're looking at it. And I think you'll start to see the incremental nature of the standardization and the process improvements now and moving forward. But the easier stuff, candidly, not easy in terms of dealing with your people and closures of plants but easier in terms of retiring assets that really weren't fit for purpose for the long term. We're kind of through that wave.
George Staphos : Understood. My next and I'll turn it over. You mentioned that you will be ready for the summer season in Brazil, yet you had some capacity constraints in September. So it sort of begs the obvious question, so how do you manage that? Is there capacity that is mothballed that you can turn back on that will allow you to hit the market in an appropriate way? And then taking a step back, a recurring question topic for Ball is obviously maturity, to put it one way, of mass beer. What can you do with the portfolio as you look out to the next couple of years to either change up your mix or get a higher return if it's required in that mass beer portfolio? Is it, in fact, I realize EVA is something you don't emphasize quite as much. Is that portfolio EVA positive and doing what it needs to do? So South America and mass beer.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thank you, George. Start with South America. So this is just a function of, obviously, in the second and third quarter, in the summer hemisphere, you are curtailing. So the answer is, it got hotter much faster in Brazil. And so we have uncurtailed the lines and we should have got ahead a little bit of the safety stock build. So you're basically 2 to 3 weeks of not easing into peak season but hitting it full on. And that probably cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 million to 400 million units. So those lines are turned on now. We do have capacity that can help serve that market, so it's really more of a Q3 phenomenon. And so that's been put into place. Obviously, you're running incredibly tight right now to make sure that when demand inflects, the one thing that we're preserving obviously is earnings and we probably managed it a bit too tight in Brazil. But I think we're on our toes moving forward and our partner in that region is doing quite well. And we'll continue to do that during peak season. That's more or less their focus period, generally speaking. And then on the mass beer, it's a great question, right? We've acquired in North America. First of all, historically, why are you there? EVA drives you to profit pools, big profit pools, versus others. Beer also, keep in mind, it's like, if you look at the category, it has declined for 20 years. However, the substrate shift in the cans has more than offset that. And the innovation in those categories have more than offset that. So what we need to be aware of and ensure is we're with the right strategic partners in that category. Some folks are winning and we're with them, but we're also with folks that are not doing well. And so we've already started some elements of rebalancing that portfolio. It does become a bit more challenging because the acquisitions over 30 years have assets right across the street from breweries. So there is some connective tissue there that it's not a quick pivot. At the same time, we've always done a nice job of creating new white spaces, innovating with the winners. We're seeing some of those gains. But given the weakness of the end consumer, you won't start to see that appreciate at a rate that's more visible, I think, in the top line results until you see a little bit more relief to the end consumer by virtue of interest rate cuts and things of that nature. We've been on this particular topic, George, for a handful of years now. I think we're moving in the right direction. We're with the folks that are going to win in this category. And the other blurry line here is, don't just focus on historical beer companies. Focus on beverage companies, alcohol companies. And one of our biggest partners has the fastest-growing RTD, probably the fastest-growing non-alcohol beer and the 2 fastest-growing domestic light beers. So there are elements of winning with the right brands, winning with portfolios, winning with folks that are innovative. All of those factor into that. It's not a quick pivot but it's one that we're encouraged about the direction of flight we're on. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I just want to build on your last comments and go back to beverage North America. Can you just give us a bit more color on how the other categories performed, especially some of the premium categories for that segment in this region? And simplistically, what is the catalyst for volumes as we look out to 2025 for this segment? And just as a corollary to that, are you winning your share of new business as it comes up in North America? And if so, how do you measure that?
Dan Fisher: Yes. So I think first things first, there's probably a macro comment here. I am quite encouraged actually for 2025 on a couple of fronts, right, that have been the drags for the end consumer. One, we finally saw the rate cuts and the manifestation of, I think, the Fed recognizing that folks need more discretionary spending power. I think versus 2019, we've got 8% less discretionary spending power. So I think that's manifesting in the food and beverage categories, there's been a lot more inflation. And so that's really weighing on the end consumer there. So the rate cut starts to help. We've also seen an acceleration of savings here over the last 6 to 8 weeks. I think the uncertainty of the election, it would be nice just to get through that period. So the combination of those 2 things are certainly going to -- when we're talking to all of our customers, they're very encouraged about 2025 on that stage and on that front. So you're going to see in the beer side, in the beer category, in the alcohol category, it is going to be folks that are paying attention to the low end on the price paradigm and on the innovation, high end. And some of our customers have better portfolios to do that than others. And they will lean into that and they will win. And as they get a tailwind of discretionary spending coming back, that category will get better. And so we're bullish on seeing growth next year in that category writ large. And we're -- I think we're with the right folks that are going to do well in that category. And then secondarily, remind me your -- sorry, your second question there, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes. I was just -- the premium subsegments that you're exposed to in North American bev, how did they perform? And then also you're winning -- are you winning your share of new business in the region?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think -- and I think you're hearing this pretty consistently. This year was -- you saw some contractual shift from us to a couple of our competitors. That was done -- 2022 is when that contract was -- that contract shuffle happened. Since then, it's been a really rational marketplace relative to that. And we should grow in line with the market moving forward. We've won business that has offset some of the contractual headwinds we were facing. . I think the issue is, underlying those wins, is then a backdrop of flattish energy this year and beer and then domestic beer on a decline. So the combination of those 2 have kind of muted the wins that we've had. But it's not hard to figure out whether you've won contractually or not. I think the share positioning all year has been a manifestation of mix, category mix, winners and losers within categories and where you sit within those portfolios and categories.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Got it. And then for my second question, maybe for you and Howard as well, just in terms of what is the starting point for base volumes for 2025 that kind of gets you to that 10% plus earnings target that you've outlined or reaffirmed, I should say?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I mean, we're -- as you know, our process, we are in the throes of it right now. But initial stages say we're in line with the -- our long-term algorithm of that 2% to 3% range for top line. It will be stronger in Europe and South America. We feel like 2025 will be better than the run rate that we're currently experiencing in North America. So we'll have the volume we need and we'll have the backdrop of the efficiency gains we need and we're still holding the line on $650 million -- or in line with D&A in terms of capital investment. So the share repurchasing and then the second half algorithm of the shares we purchased this year are all going to contribute to some really nice tailwinds into '25.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: I think your restructuring charges ex insurance recovery was a little bit more than $90 million. Is that all related to Santa Cruz in Brazil and the Kent, Washington plant? Or are there any other curtailments or closures that are involved in that charge?
Howard Yu: Yes, Jeff. I think some of that -- the vast majority of that, I believe, is related to some of these closures that we've had. We've also had a closure in [indiscernible] that is also reflected in some of that number, too. The other component of this, I would say, is around IT and related to -- if you're thinking about it in the context of non-continuing operations related to the sale of aerospace. And so that's a component of that, that you would see in there as well.
Dan Fisher: Jeff, we also took, through the op model restructure, we did take some actions midyear. So there was severance associated with a number of individuals here as we were rightsizing the business post aerospace acquisition.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: And then secondly, when you reflect on your aluminum cups initiative, what do you think are the key reasons that held that initiative back?
Dan Fisher: I think the biggest -- the 2 biggest things, biggest issue is inflation, weakened consumer, a price point that's unsustainable relative to what people are willing to pay for sustainability. I don't think anybody was anticipating kind of the world we're living in here right now in terms of the inflationary pressures and the reduced discretionary spend of the end consumer. So that was a challenged environment for sure. And then I think the downstream recycling infrastructure that's required is also far more complicated. And we know it pretty well but I think in some of the service industry, airports, travel, transportation, we found that it presented some pretty significant barriers to move quickly, at least on that side of the house.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess first question was, I think there was an $85 million closure charge in the quarter. Is that correct? What was that for in North America and South America?
Howard Yu: Yes. I think we just answered that question, same to what Jeff was asking, Arun, is the closures associated with the reductions in Kent, some of these other ones that we've done here in North America, as well as the ones that we've done in South America as well. And so I think you're asking fundamentally the same question. And restructure, of course.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Great. And then just on the -- it seems like a large amount though but nevertheless, just wondering about the volume progression, how you see that kind of evolving over the next few quarters. I know that you have some of the easier comps in the back half of this year. Those will start dropping off. So do you expect kind of -- how do you kind of expect to make that greater than 10% -- or 10% or greater earnings growth? I know you've laid out some low single-digit growth targets in the past at your Investor Day and so on. But how are you thinking about can growth from here?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think the easier comp would only be in Europe for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter was incredibly strong in South America. There was a little bit -- so a little bit of Argentina too that we'll have to offset there. North America will be a reflection of end consumer health in the fourth quarter, how quickly the rate cuts, and I think the election stabilization there and the people are stopping to save money and spend money, those will all help that. Enter '25, we're feeling confident about all 3 regions. I think we've answered this question as well but bears repeating. 2% to 3% growth, in line with our Analyst Day expectations, led by what we laid out at Analyst Day as well. Europe will continue to grow at a healthy rate. South America will grow at a healthy rate. North America will be kind of in that lower end of the 1% to 3% range based on what we see today. But there's hope coming and optimism coming in North America where they're finally getting after the rate cuts and that's what our end consumers need. So that, coupled with consistency of share buyback, returning value and then you'll get the compound effect of the lower weighted average shares going into 2025. So 2025 will -- should shape up to be a nice year for us.
Howard Yu: Yes. I think, Arun, maybe just to piggyback on that, what we did outline during Investor Day is that we're on this journey to reduce costs on a gross basis of $500 million over the next several years. And so -- and you've heard us talking about the traction that we're getting here in 2024. And I would expect that we would continue on this journey as we're just starting it really. And so 2025, '26 and '27, all of those. And so as Dan indicated, we have a very high level of confidence in being able to deliver the 10-plus percent EPS next year.
Arun Viswanathan: And just real quickly on the footprint. I know that you guys have obviously closed some plants, as you noted. Is that kind of come full circle? We've been hearing that utilization rates for your system may be in the low 90s. So would that require more closures, or do you feel pretty good about where you are with the footprint?
Dan Fisher: Yes. We feel good about the footprint at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari: Just maybe piggybacking on that last question. Given the strength in EMEA, can you talk about what your operating rate in Europe is? And then just in terms of the ability to meet, I think, 3% to 5% growth long term that you outlined at the Analyst Day, how long can you go before maybe some debottlenecking projects or maybe even possibly greenfield? Can you just kind of talk about the system and your ability to meet demand there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. In Europe, I don't -- Anthony, we don't see a need for an additional greenfield in Europe, I think Mainland Europe for the next 2 to 3 years. That's sort of our planning period that we're looking at. We did build, as you know, 2 new facilities that have ability or run rate to add lines. And so we'll maximize that. We'll also maximize, to your point, where we can speed up lines and add process equipment and debottleneck and all of the things that you're familiar with. The one caveat will be that EMEA region, there are areas that are growing even at a faster rate. And -- but they're a little bit more volatile markets, so you have a bit more patience there, places like Egypt, places like Turkey, India is in that mix. So I would caveat or pull those regions out of my initial comments. But all of what we're talking about here is in the envelope of our spending capital at D&A. We can do all of what we need to, to help grow specifically Europe and South America at those outsized growth rates. I think we spent the capital we needed to in North America. So we're -- the team is laser-focused on ensuring that we're returning value to shareholders and enabling the investments in the areas that are going to give us the greatest payback.
Howard Yu: Maybe one more thing to add there, Anthony, I would say, on the substrate shift, Europe is still relatively early in that journey. And so we're seeing a good lift and we will continue to see that. I think the substrate shift is something less than 32% as we speak today. And so there's plenty of runway there as well.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a quick question on kind of the consumer weakness that you've seen in North America. You've talked about kind of standard sizes versus specialty sizes versus super specialty, I think at the Analyst Day, cups were kind of included in that super specialty category. And obviously, it's been a bit weaker. I'm just wondering, when you look at kind of the broader portfolio, are you seeing kind of a mix down in North America between specialty cans and 12-ounce where you're more likely to sell a 6-pack of a 12-ounce standard can and some of those higher ASP products in specialty sizes are not growing as fast or maybe you're kind of losing some mix there? And is that impacting the overall profitability of the business, or is that cutting it maybe a little bit too finely?
Dan Fisher: I think, Anthony, it's cutting it a bit too finely. But you are on to something here and I'll just draw this out a bit. So you look at energy specifically, right and you look at the end consumer for energy categories and where they consume those products, they shop at a C-store channel. And many of these individuals are in construction or they're in the service industry. And overwhelmingly, the majority of these consumers are Hispanic. The Hispanic unemployment rate is nearly 6%. And so when we talk to our energy customers, they're telling us that the interest rates and that particular category in that channel have been impacted. Those are overwhelmingly specialty cans in that category but they're not -- they're the less special variety. So it's 16 ounce, right? And so we -- that's what's happening within the energy category right now. So that starts to relieve itself, interest rate cuts and a couple of other things. So that's why I'm more bullish about moving into 2025 with some tailwinds in and around that. But you do have to slice it down to a pretty discrete level to kind of parcel out can size, channel, customer, regional aspects to it. Specialty is still special and it's still tight. It's just like the general malaise, I think, of the end consumer is what we're experiencing right now across all categories and all can sizes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stefan Diaz with Morgan Stanley.
Stefan Diaz: Maybe to start and piggybacking off George's question around South America. Can you tell us what the volume number was in Brazil and maybe what you think the market grew in the quarter? I understand it's a seasonably slow period there. And maybe additionally, if you could speak to the profitability upside versus Street expectations, despite the volume headwinds you faced in the quarter. Is that more operational excellence? Or was there potentially some more end shipments in the quarter? If you could just dig into that a little bit, that would be helpful.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thanks. Nearly double-digit growth in South America and Brazil, specifically, sorry. And we were flat to slightly down and I think we left about 3% to 4% of growth on the table by not matching our production with demand. Our primary strategic partner did not win in the quarter. But we expect them to do well in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, which is, of course, their peak season, which you referenced. And then I would say it wasn't actually end mix. Typically, as you know, we make those ends in a very favorable tax jurisdiction. So that mix can increase or decrement profitability as a result of that mix but we're shipping less ends actually. This is all improved performance and really appreciate the team with regards to that down in South America. So hopefully, continued margin benefits through our focus on operations with a little bit of a tailwind there in South America bodes well for us. I think we'll certainly make more money in Q4. And then it's -- for us, it's the culmination really of the countries outside of Brazil that will dictate whether we're growing or we're not. We'll certainly grow for the year and grow in line with expectations that we've laid out. But whether we grow mid-single digits or closer to low single digits, I think it will be all indicative of what happens in Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Chile and Argentina and that recovery there.
Stefan Diaz: Great. And then I'm glad to hear that everybody is okay in the Tampa region following the storm there. That said, with the 2 storms in the Southeast, do you believe that they had any impact on North American volume in the quarter?
Dan Fisher: No, I don't. I think we lost almost 2 full days, 3 days of production. But that, like you said, in a shoulder period. This would have contributed to some missed volume and probably a bridge items worth of -- had it been June, July, August time period. But we were able to -- we were able to source those customers largely from our other regional assets there. And thanks for the well wishes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Michael Leithead: First question on South America. Can you help us better understand the impact of Argentina on segment volumes? If I heard you correctly, Brazil was flattish. So is Argentina down something like double the segment average? And then relatedly, how are you assessing your presence or footprint in Argentina just given all the uncertainty and volatility there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. For the full year, what we're anticipating right now is -- and this would include the fourth quarter, somewhere between 500 million to 600 million units of decrement year-over-year due to Argentina volumes when you compare it to 2023. And the third quarter was approximately 270 million that Argentina was down, in the third quarter versus the prior year. So as it relates to Argentina, I'll give you, Argentina is really good when it's good and its' not so good when it's not. Having said that, we've been there the last -- 30 years ago, we stayed in that market and it's grown significantly and the can does really well there. And our 2 most important strategic partners in South America are there. They're going to continue to be there and they want us to be there to support them. Having said all that, we're eyes wide open. I think Howard and I went down in April, met with the central bank, met with the Vice President, met with the Secretary of Commerce. Everything they laid out at that time, they're executing against. So we're seeing currency controls easing. We're seeing inflation at sort of the lowest levels. Howard, I'd ask you to weigh in.
Howard Yu: Yes, I think that's right. I think, if anything, it's incrementally a little bit better. And so that gives us, I think, some optimism overall as it relates to their policies taking hold and even being able to repatriate funds and things of that nature. I think that the banking system is improving a little bit there as well in the increment. And so I think that we expect 2025 to continue on that progress path. And as Dan said, this is -- Argentina has historically been a very profitable area. That all said, we do recognize that the volumes down in Argentina in the third quarter were in excess of 30%. That being said, we don't see as much of a profit impact this year as we did last year when these policies and the initial shock associated with that, those churns had happened. So overall, I think we're going to be watchful and mindful and doing a lot of scenario planning, which is what we do. But we feel as though the long-term prospects still remain quite favorable for us in Argentina.
Michael Leithead: Great. That's sounds super helpful. And then secondly, can you talk a bit more about what the Alucan acquisition brings to your existing extruded aluminum business? And are there other aerosol or adjacent opportunities in the M&A pipeline still out there for you guys?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Well, I think first things first, it's -- one of the facilities was actually part of our original investment in this space. And so we've actually run the plant in Spain, some of our employees have. So we know it well and we know the customer base very, very well. They also built a new facility in Belgium. So we're stepping into a footprint that will enable us to grow incrementally without having to build a greenfield facility. And that is a business that has been growing mid-single digits, high single digits. Very encouraging. And so we were faced with a number of capital allocation decisions and this was just uniquely presented. The individual who was the owner is retiring. And so you know this, anything in M&A, it all looks good on paper but you have to have a buyer and a seller and this was -- we were the right owner for it. And yes, we're excited to welcome these folks on board. So that came nicely and there are other opportunities within the space. It's pretty fragmented. And so we -- where there's an opportunity and there's a buyer and seller, I mean this is -- these are really nice bolt-ons for us and fits well within our capital allocation structure and we continue to return value to our shareholders. So all the stars lined on this one and so hopefully, there are more of those out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.
Joshua Spector: I apologize if I missed this but I wanted to ask specifically on the 4Q EPS expectations. So last call, you talked about fourth quarter being up maybe about a 10% kind of normal growth. You reiterated your mid-single-digit growth for the year. So that's, at the low end, that could mean that EPS is flat or maybe even slightly down. So can you just clarify what your expectation is for the quarter?
Howard Yu: Yes, Josh, what I would say is that we did have a little bit of improvement in Q3. We had our insurance proceeds. I think we outlined that in our prepared comments as well that came in associated with the Verona fire. And so that was probably $0.02 that was pulled into Q3 based on timing. So that comes out of Q4. That said, I think that the expectation is that Q4 will continue to increment upwards as it relates to EPS. And as we said, that would probably be a mid-single digit, mid-single-digit plus range as well to get us for the full year in that range.
Joshua Spector: Okay. That's helpful. And I wanted to go back to one of the earlier questions, just on the cost savings and efficiency. Just you talked about scenario planning. I guess if we're scenario planning for next year and saying maybe there's a scenario where volumes are more flattish versus up low single, what kind of cost efficiencies or earnings could you see in that scenario from what's in your control and what you're doing today?
Howard Yu: What I would say, Josh, is that we're focused in on controlling what we can and making sure that this operational efficiency standardization journey that we're on continues to move forward and we get that -- we continue to gain traction. That all said, as Dan outlined, we're in the throes of our annual process as we look at 2025. And so we'll have some more prepared comments for you with our Q4 earnings.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho.
Edlain Rodriguez: I mean just a quick observation on Argentina. Are people really drinking less because of this tough economic conditions? Because you would think they would want to forget the problems. And so I guess, like not everyone is like my friends down there. So a little surprising there to see volume down so much because of the economic conditions. So if you go into Europe then, again, we've been seeing like a nice recovery there. Like would you attribute that to improving end consumer demand? Or is that just like restocking, easier comps? Like what's really driving that strength overall?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Good. So I think if you get outside of Buenos Aires, yes, dramatically less spending power in Argentina, people are drinking a lot less. Obviously -- we were just down there last week, by the way. So significantly different consumption profile than 1 year ago. And then secondarily, in EMEA, there has been 2 things that have happened this year that have been better than we anticipated coming into the year. One, the pricing of our customers have been a bit more aggressive. Now at the same point in Europe, there's a bit more control by the retailers on what you can pass through in terms of price. So there's been conscious effort by a number of our customers to go get share. Number 2, there has been relief on energy. So relatively speaking, folks in Europe don't have as much discretionary spend power as they did in '19, before the energy spikes. However, they've got relatively more in their pocket, right, than they did certainly at this time 1 year ago. So those 2 things contributed. The destocking, restocking event that you're characterizing, that will be a Q4 impact, not as much of a Q3. So what you've seen through the first 9 months are real. Maybe a bit of improvement in Q1. That was ahead of true demand because I think they lowered the inventory levels too much in Q4 of last year. So you would have seen that come through in Q1 more than you would have seen it at this point. And then it should be a relatively easier comp in Q4 because of this phenomenon that you characterized.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.
John Dunigan: Dan, Howard, this is John Dunigan, on for Phil. Appreciate all the detail, guys. I just wanted to first touch on the cups business. I mean you said you're looking at strategic alternatives. I mean, is there anything else that you're really looking to explore outside a potential sale? Is there more investment or acquisitions to bolster up the business or anything along those lines?
Howard Yu: Yes. John, well, let me say first that no formal or firm decision has been made. But as we think about that business, it's just we're losing probably in the magnitude of $40 million this year and that can't continue. And so we'll look at various different options, whether that means rightsizing that business going forward. Again, as you outlined, maybe some sort of joint venture or third-party interaction there that can maybe focus more on that business. And then obviously, thinking through whether or not we wind that down. So all of those things are in play. But certainly something that we need to address here in the short term.
Dan Fisher: I would not think in terms of additional capital, either via acquisition or putting it into the business.
John Dunigan: Got it. I appreciate that. And then on South America, I know we've talked about it a lot. I mean, you guys said you started up just maybe a couple of weeks, few weeks behind a normal schedule and hotter weather came in. Is that something that you guys can catch up on? I mean I know you're running full out now and it seems like the summer is good but 3% to 4% maybe lost in 3Q, is that able to be recaptured in the summer selling season in 4Q, 1Q time? And then as you're thinking about the region, going into maybe next year and beyond, already running full out, is that a region that you see needing more capacity as your primary customer grows? Is it something where you can maybe pull some of the assets that you had in Argentina to help supply the Brazilian market? Maybe just what are your thoughts on this.
Dan Fisher: No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. Simply put, in all of our businesses during the winter period or this low period, you're always curtailing, you're always doing maintenance work. I think you were still -- let's be honest, we were still kind of chasing the bottom of volumes in South America. It feels like we're inflecting positively now. And so it's a reframing of stocking levels, when you do your maintenance, pulling it up further earlier. So you can manage this, I think, more effectively. There's more capacity to run as opposed to curtail. We were laser-focused on driving the bottom line. And when you see a surge that's weather related to this magnitude, now, you've missed it in the third quarter, we're running, to your point, we're running our assets in Chile and Argentina and other places where we might have a bit more excess capacity to catch up. So I think we'll be better prepared for it next year in a more stable top line environment, which is really encouraging. But you kind of missed that shoulder season onetime benefit there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist.
Michael Roxland: Just 2 quick ones for me. Just can you -- Dan, can you go through the cadence of shipments in North America during the quarter? And where do October shipments stand in North America at present?
Dan Fisher: Yes. It was -- I would say August was okay and then things started to really slow September time frame. And as we're heading into -- right now, I think it's a continuance of that. You can see that reflected in the scanner data. But 2 things will have to happen. It's usually a 60-, 90-day impact for those interest rate cuts to flow through, #1. And #2, I think you've seen this as well. It's -- people are saving at a pretty high rate right now. And I think we got to get through next week and hopefully, there's some stabilization there. And those 2 things should help to inflect. Like I said, our customers are pretty darn encouraged about 2025, a little bit more stabilization, inflation stabilizing, interest rate cuts. But I think we're still in a level of uncertainty here as I sit here and talk to you today about Q4.
Michael Roxland: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the strategic customer realignment mentioned earlier. Obviously, a lot of things to consider, particularly given where your plants are situated. But also to me and correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like you're still focused on beer. I mean is there any way to really diversify more into other end-markets? Or is the strategy really just trying to realign with brands that are winning in beer?
Dan Fisher: Well, we're with the brands that are winning in beer, overwhelmingly, right? It's -- there's been -- I mean, we're with all the brewers and the company that's winning the most, we've got a dramatically significant share of that position. And then I think within -- we don't look at it, I would say, Michael, as beer anymore. We look at it as alcohol. So the folks that have the best portfolio, best alcohol portfolios, we're with them. Can you reposition? Of course. I would just reiterate this. Historically, the margin in the beer space have been far better than any of the other. So you might get the growth but the diversification historically, would have come at a cost. And so the other thing about beer, just to remind everyone, it's like we weren't declining because we were taking substrate. So if you still believe that a substrate shift is there and it's going to happen, then it's not a bad place to be. But making those calculations and prognosticating, it's different now because beer now has a 70% share of aluminum -- or aluminum has a 70% share of beer. But there's still opportunities. There was another glass closure just announced this week. So I think you've got to be really thoughtful about the mix. Generally speaking, we are very thoughtful about the mix and who's winning and we generally have those, the more innovative folks, the acquirers. I think the demise of beer is a little bit overdone given the backdrop of that substrate shift. So beer in general, yes, has been declining for 20 years but it hasn't within our portfolio. And I think the end consumer softness has a lot more to do with this than the beer decline. So that's what I would posit. And Christine, we're done here and very much appreciate everybody's questions and certainly hope that everyone has a good holiday and our folks remain safe. And we'll talk to you again after the year. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Potthoff, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Brandon Potthoff: Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2024 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our Web site at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of noncomparable items as well as a reconciliation of comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. References to net sales and comparable operating earnings in today's release and call do not include the company's former Aerospace business. Year-to-date net earnings attributable to the corporation and comparable net earnings do include the performance of the company's former Aerospace business through the sale date of February 16, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fisher, CEO.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Brandon. Today, I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss second quarter financial performance and key metrics for 2024. And and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. We remain laser focused on creating a better, more sustainable world. During the quarter, Ball was included in the FTSE4Good Index Series, which is designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance practices. This highlights our unwavering commitment towards a more circular future. Across our global organization, our employees continue to demonstrate our values in the areas of recycling, education and STEM manufacturing and disaster relief and preparedness as evidenced by our recent global volunteer month impact. During the month of April, our employees contributed over 3,100 volunteer hours across 17 countries. Thank you to our 16,000 colleagues that continue to demonstrate that we care. Under the themes that we work and we win, our team delivered strong second quarter results. Global beverage can, global extruded aluminum aerosol shipments, increased 2.8% and 5.6% in the quarter, respectively. In addition, we executed on our share repurchase plans and have returned approximately $925 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends as of today's call. Reflecting further on year-to-date 2024 performance, aluminum packaging continues to outperform other substrates across the globe. In North America and EMEA, second quarter volumes exceeded our internal expectations. In South America, softer than anticipated volume performance was driven by our exposure to Argentina. For a complete summary of regional shipments for the second quarter, please refer to today's earnings release. Consistent with our previous commentary and given our customer mix and incorporating second quarter and year-to-date regional volume performance, we continue to anticipate full year global shipments to grow in the low to mid single digits range. Key drivers for our company's performance in 2024 continue to be the benefits of deleveraging, repurchasing shares, improving operational efficiencies and leveraging our well capitalized plant assets to grow the use of innovative, sustainable aluminum packaging across channels, categories and venues. Based on our current demand trends and the previously mentioned drivers, we are positioned to grow comparable diluted EPS mid single digits plus of 2023 reported comparable diluted EPS of $2.90 per share, generate strong adjusted free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and now expect return of value in excess of $1.6 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard.
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan. Turning to our results. Second quarter 2024 comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.74 versus $0.61 in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter sales were influenced by the pass through of lower aluminum prices as well as lower volumes in South America, offset by increased volumes in North America and EMEA as well as favorable price/mix in South America. Second quarter comparable net earnings of $232 million were up year-over-year, primarily due to strong operational performance, including improved year-over-year performance in North America, EMEA and South America, lower corporate undistributed costs and lower interest expense. In North America, segment comparable operating earnings exceeded our expectations and offset year-over-year headwinds associated with the US beer brand disruption. Benefits of effective cost management and plant efficiencies across our well capitalized plant network will continue to support incremental volume growth. We continue to anticipate year-over-year earnings improvement during the second half of 2024, driven by improving operational efficiencies, lowering cost and effectively managing risk. In EMEA, overall segment volumes were up stronger than anticipated. Recent demand trends remain favorable and the business continues to be poised for year-over-year comparable operating earnings growth throughout the remainder of 2024, driven by improving operational efficiencies and volume growth. In South America, our segment volumes decreased 3.2%, following a strong first quarter where volumes increased 26.3%. During the second quarter, consumer conditions in Argentina deteriorated further, though we appear to be beyond the most difficult comparisons given the timing of Argentina's 2023 slowdown. Despite these challenges, strong demand in Brazil of mid single digit volume growth and our customer mix continue to drive our business. We continue to monitor the dynamic economic situation in Argentina and potential scenarios that could impact results. We remain optimistic about Brazil and our ability to deliver sequential earnings and volume improvement as we enter the summer selling season in South America. Moving on to additional key financial metrics and goals for 2024. Very consistent figures to those provided during our first quarter earnings call and June Investor Day commentary. We continue to anticipate year end 2024 net debt to comparable EBITDA to be below 2.5 times. While we are currently at 2.3 times at the end of the second quarter, net debt to comparable EBITDA may nudge slightly higher by the end of the year as the company continues payments of taxes due on the gain from the sale of the aerospace. 2024 CapEx is targeted to be in the range of $650 million, a year-over-year reduction of $400 million and largely driven by carrying capital related to prior year's projects. We are on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow target. And share repurchases are expected to be in excess of $1.4 billion by year end. Through today's call, we have repurchased approximately $800 million in shares year-to-date. Our 2024 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 21%, largely driven by lower year-over-year R&D tax credit associated with the sale of the company's aerospace business. Relative to the estimated tax payments due on the aerospace sale, the first payment was made during the second quarter and the remainder of the approximately $1 billion in taxes due will be paid throughout the second half of 2024. Full year 2024 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $300 million. Excluding the noncomparable aerospace disposition compensation costs, full year 2024 reported adjusted corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are expected to be in the range of $90 million. And last week, Ball's Board declared a quarterly cash dividend. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we remain laser focused on operational excellence, driving efficiency and productivity across our business, cost management and monitoring emerging market volatility. We are committed to maximizing the full potential of our company over the long term. We have executed on derisking the corporation through recent debt retirements and we have no significant near-term maturities. The runway is clear for us to activate near term initiatives to consistently deliver high quality results and generate compounding shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Howard. The business is operating well. And as we look forward to the second half of the year, we continue to anticipate growing our 2024 comparable diluted EPS mid single digits plus. While the consumer backdrop remains volatile due to the strength of our portfolio and the unwavering dedication of our employees, we are confident we will deliver on our 2024 guidance and long term commitments laid out at our June Investor Day. Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our enterprise wide strategy to advance sustainable aluminum packaging solutions on a global scale by accelerating our pathway to carbon neutral and unlocking additional value from within the organization by driving continuous process improvement through operational excellence. Together, we will strive to deliver innovative aluminum packaging solutions that can lead to a world free from waste and embark on a path to deliver compounding shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. As we communicated at our June Investor Day, shareholder value creation is our focus. Going forward, we anticipate 10% plus per annum diluted EPS growth, consistent delivery of high quality results and operational performance, coupled with significant share repurchases for the foreseeable future. In addition to returning value to shareholders via dividends we’ll drive shareholder value creation. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. Thank you. And with that, Christine, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess first off on 6.5% growth in the EMEA segment for 2Q. I think you mentioned it came in above your internal expectations. If you could just give us a bit more color on that, what drove that specifically? And then also how do you see that evolving into the back half of the year?
Dan Fisher: I think a little bit of it. As we were transitioning out of Q1 into Q2, we were starting to see some relief, some inflation relief. So the end consumer was strengthening in pockets and couple that with a little bit more aggressive pricing by some of the customers that I would consider that we're in a more of a partnership relationship than just a customer supplier relationship. And so we benefited a bit from mix. I think this is something going on over here consistently now and I was saying it all year, it's like winners and losers or if you're a little ahead of the market, a little below, it probably has more to do with mix region by region right now than it does with winning or losing contracts in many respects. And we have the opposite mix in Europe that we do in the US where we have a heavier CSP -- heavier energy portfolio over there than when you contrast that to our North America, which is heavier on the beer side. And so we benefited from it in Europe. We anticipated some good pull through on the euro competition. It's interesting. We were actually ahead in Europe and there was some pretty crummy weather in the Nordics, in the UK and Ireland and places like that, and it's ahead of the holiday season, which can really give you a bit more of a tailwind. So it was a surprise on multiple fronts, incremental surprised, not a significant surprise. We continue to -- and you've heard us say this, we continue to be very bullish on Europe over the medium and long term just because I think the can has a lot of runway there. But some nice signs that folks are fighting for some volume there probably -- maybe even more so than they're doing in places like North America, and we benefited from mix there and expect to continue to do well there for the balance of the year and in the foreseeable future.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then for beverage, North America, Central America, how did that sort of break out between US, Canada versus, let's say, Mexico and some of the other regions down there? And then just holistically then, as you think about your portfolio and the new products that the industry has introduced to higher price point items, et cetera, in context of consumer affordability. So as you kind of think about the weakness you're still seeing in portions of the North American business. How is that propagating, is it still at the low end or is it starting to permeate towards the middle consumer and the high end as well?
Dan Fisher: It is -- I mean in the US, I think the US is different than the rest of the world. It's a pretty stark contrast. You even see it in one of the major brewers, they're growing at the high end brand and they're growing at the low end brand. It's kind of the premium light beer segment, that's the one that folks are trading down from. But we've seen this now Ghansham, for like 18 months. It's like we've been living this and that's kind of -- candidly, that's why we've been adjusting our cost structure, we've been doing different things with the operating model. You see things like slower growth in -- you see things like slower growth at the energy drink level. This is signs that you see this in the past, this is when you're kind of touching the bottom end of kind of these recessionary points and the health of the end consumer. So we're operating in that environment. We're still growing and we're making more money. So that all feels good. If you get a little -- if you get an interest rate cut, you're potentially in September and a little bit more clarity on the election, all of those things tend to translate into a bit more optimism probably from us and our competitors based on where we are, because to your point, I don't see a lot more downside on the end consumer. We've been living it though for about 18 months. So we've seen the trade downs and then we've seen the less frequent purchases. And I think what you're also hearing as a result of that is from our customers and from certain categories in certain segments, they're going to have to address that via different pricing mechanisms to drive volume. So I think we're kind of -- we're in a good spot relative to that, believe it or not versus how we've been operating in the last 18 months as an industry. So I'm a bit more encouraged than pessimistic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George Staphos: I just want to pick up my first question, piggy back on topic Ghansham raised. So at this juncture, are your customers talking about doing more incremental net promotion price reduction, et cetera [indiscernible] variable end market, or do they see kind of the next way to grow out of this really on innovation? And kind of the context, if we go back not quite 10 years ago but sort of post Rexam, especially in alcohol, there was a lack of volume growth and it was innovation that drove growth, at least in part. At this juncture, innovation comes at a higher price. Is this the wrong time to drive innovation? So really the only way to deal with this to drop price and raise promotion, how are your customers thinking about that? And what are you doing to help them in that evaluation?
Dan Fisher: So this breaks down -- in the US -- this is a US phenomenon, probably more than any other region that I see. At the high end, that's where the innovation is going, okay? So if you look at beer, in particular, the high end of the brands, folks are -- they're spending more on advertising and they're innovating more there because people are willing to pay for it. At the low end, it is a value put. And so if you look at the largest brewer in North America, you'll see they have two brands that are growing disproportionately to the rest. One is squarely on the higher end of the end consumer and one is squarely on the low end of the end consumer. Now the big middle portion, that is sort of the premium light beer, that is the one that will have to be priced differently. So innovation will continue to get pushed. It will get pushed into new categories and it will get pushed into higher end brand categories that already exist. And then you've got to be competitive on the low end of those ranges, maybe even more so than historically. And in the middle, that's where folks that are doing well in the marketplace, whether it's on the CSD side or on the alcohol side, they are playing the CPI game really well, they are playing the branding game very well, they're playing the discount and the revenue models really well and brand superiority starts to show up. The real integrity of the brand and the value of the brand shows up now, as you well know, after covering this for many years. So I think that's how we're looking at and we're helping them in every -- listen, we can help you with innovation and we can use our fleet of assets to help you really layer in lower costs in terms of the supply chain and the agility to deliver. So there are ways that we can use the economies of scale that we have to work both sides of that equation. And then what's left for the customer to figure out is how they play some of these major brands and what the brand value is and how they're going to price that to drive volume. And I think that's what will be coming around more so than anything here in the next six months. Some thinking in and around that, that will be more growth oriented. And then with the backdrop of the end consumer, is it enough to drive the volume? My belief is, it will at least maintain the stable position that we've been operating under, and it could be a slight uptick. Hope that was helpful. It is different than Rexam. It is different than post Rexam. I will tell you that. You're on to that. Yes, it's definitely different conversations. But you've got to fight with innovation even on the high end brands and you've got to be incredibly focused and diligent on supply chain efficiencies on the low end. So that is -- with just more intentionality on both ends of it.
George Staphos: So what does that mean for your mix as you layer those two or three or pull those two or three levers that your customers do into the back half of the year, what are you seeing in terms of volume trends to start 3Q? And how do you feel about the plant network overall as it exists relative to those trends as you see them?
Dan Fisher: I think there's an aspect here where mix will matter in the short term. So there won't be -- you'll be thinking about, there's a minor October reset but it will be more in the February -- January, February retail reset, where you see some more innovation and some more introductions in and around that, and around the Super Bowl, that's typically what happens in North America. Our fleet cost average is lowering a lot of the decisions we made in terms of the fixed cost of our plans. We're seeing the benefits in our new operating model, we're laser focused on efficiency and operational excellence. We're seeing those benefits. We're running -- freight cost is better, our warehousing footprint smaller. So there's a lot of supply chain efficiencies that we're benefiting from. You'll see more of it as volumes grow. So I feel like we're having the right conversations with our customers, they're seeing that, our Net Promoter Score continues to rise. And so I know that the conversations we're having and the efforts that we're making are resonating with the customers. We're seeing some benefits of that. But in the immediate short term, your customer base matters now more than any time and we've benefited from who our customers are here this year in particular in North America.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: So over the past few years, Ball has increased its capacity in North America. And then what it did is, it reduced it to become more efficient. If you compare your North American capacity today to what it was in 2019, has it changed very much?
Dan Fisher: Yes, we have more capacity. We're selling more. We have more capacity and there's additional envelope and room for us to grow capacity further.
Jeff Zekauskas: And in terms of the volume that you experienced in the Americas in the second quarte, was the beer market down and the consumer soft drink market for you up?
Dan Fisher: That's correct. Our customer portfolio on the CSD side was a benefit to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: I was wondering if you could square kind of your short term view here around growth versus your long-term view. And just given kind of some of the outperformance here in 2Q, do you think you could start to see, call it, high single digit to 10% plus growth in EPS in the second half, considering you're starting to face some easier comps, or do you need a more favorable backdrop to really drive more of that?
Dan Fisher: Just one thing, I would say, we did have a fairly significant -- I'll let Howard describe Q3. I would say Q4 and moving forward, your comment is correct. Q3, there's an anomaly, I'll let him describe that for you.
Howard Yu: Yes, that's right, Josh. We did have -- on the R&D tax credit side, we had a pretty meaningful impact in Q3 of last year. This was associated with the aerospace business and so those to the tune of nearly $40 million. And so obviously, that will make for the comps in Q3 to be a bit more challenging. But as Dan said, I think going into the fourth quarter and certainly beyond, we've said that we'd achieved 10%-plus EPS in 2025 and each year after that.
Dan Fisher: And in Q3, just to reiterate, if you take out the onetime benefit, then yes, we're operating at 10%-plus EPS moving forward.
Howard Yu: And I think just even despite the tax credit, I think that we will be up as it relates to third quarter EPS. And so that $40 million or nearly $40 million is a pretty meaningful impact. But despite that we’ll still be up year-over-year.
Josh Spector: I just wanted to follow up on specifically inventory in beer in North America. I don't know if you have any visibility around your customer levels of where things are at in terms of days or cases? And if there is more promotional activity, is that a big pull forward for you or do you think inventories probably stay leaner for longer?
Dan Fisher: I think our inventories are going to be a bit stronger moving forward, will lift a little. They're a bit too low. As you recall and this going back to Q1, we helped one of our beer partners significantly in Q1. So we kind of overshipped in one and now we're operating at lower inventory levels. So it's a rebalancing because of that for us that will settle out by the end of the year. And then I'm encouraged about kind of the trajectory of flight on a couple of the beer brands in particular. So yes, I'd say it's yet to be determined. But for us, in particular, no, we will still have some uplift in the second half of the year because we were operating so low in the first half because of some unique anomalies with uni negotiations and things like this.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC.
Arun Viswanathan: Good to see the results. So I guess just a couple of questions on South America. So obviously, some challenging conditions in Argentina, some volatility down there. Do you still expect a very robust second half in your South America business, especially Q4? And what gives you that visibility? I mean, I guess, again, there is a lot of volatility on there, but are there any specific drivers that you'd point to?
Dan Fisher: We've got really good ones. First of all, thank you. I hope you're doing well. The only thing we've got out here in Denver is two or three forest fires happening. So if you hear us coughing that's all coming from. So the second quarter, let me -- let’s just set the stage for the second quarter and what happened in Brazil and particularly. So in 2023, in the second quarter, the third largest brewery filed for bankruptcy and they didn't participate much in the market. They had a good showing this second quarter. And so when you're looking at comps year-over-year, we were stronger last year than we were this year because that entrant didn't participate. But year-to-date, we're up 10%-plus because our partners are winning disproportionately overall in the market, and they have been for a year plus. And so much of our business is tied to a couple of folks who we have a lot of conversations with and we're encouraged about a couple of underlying themes, right? We've talked about the can continuing to gain back share. About two years ago, we saw returnable glass gain share 6 to 7 points, I believe, of substrate share, which always happens in an inflationary environment. There's a quick repositioning of that, that's now coming back solely but surely. So we picked up a couple points of can share in the Brazil market, which is meaningful once you get to peak season, which, of course, second quarter is the least. And then Chile had a rough winter period, one of the coldest on record. So that will rebound. Our Paraguay business is doing very well. Peru is doing well. And then it just boils down to Argentina. So I think we have line of sight into over -- what the overall majority of our business, and we're encouraged about the back half trajectory. And in Argentina, the volumes are still going to show a degradation over the back half of the year from a comp perspective because volumes really didn't start to slow down until this quarter and a little bit of the first quarter. But what happened this time a year ago in Argentina is there was a lot of regulatory, monetary and fiscal policy that was eating into our margins like taxes holding on to receivables for a longer period of time. So the margin comparability will be pretty flat year-over-year in Argentina until you see some improved conditions there but the volumes will still show a little bit of a decline. And rough order of magnitude, the decline for Argentina is roughly a 1% volume decline for Ball year-over-year. So it's meaningful on the volume line. It's not as meaningful on the earnings line moving forward. And then as the end consumer starts to gain a bit of strength down there, which we're starting to see early signs of it that will start to come back and we'll lever up nicely. So feeling good about the second half in South America, a lots going on in that region, as you said, but the fundamentals of the macro environment in our biggest country that we participate in continues to be buoyed by really good fiscal discipline, inflation continuing to monitor to the lower end of even what the central banks are proposing. So we're feeling good about that and we feel like we're coming off of some less favorable environments in Chile and Argentina. So let's see how we get on but the next six to 12 months should be improved in both of those areas.
Arun Viswanathan: And then maybe if I could just ask a follow-up. So I appreciate the long term comment on greater than 10% or 10% or better EPS growth. In our models, it seems like we're modeling kind of mid single digit or better EBIT growth in '25 and the rest is coming from lower interest expense and share buyback. Assuming that's correct, are you saying that you're able to maintain that level of growth in '25 and beyond. So are you kind of implying that you will continue to buy back stock and pull on some other levers other than just volume in order to the feedback level of EPS growth. Maybe you can just elaborate on what gives you the confidence that you'll continue to maintain that greater than 10% EPS growth rate?
Dan Fisher: I'll just make one high-level comment, and then I'll have Howard chime in. And so if you go back to our Investor Day, and I probably didn't do a great job of pointing this out. But what we laid out, and we have a high degree of confidence in is probably somewhere closer to the 13% to 15% range as opposed to the 10% plus, and it's coming from exactly what you described a steady diet of us staying within our $650 million capital envelope and expanding operating cash flow by managing our earnings and managing our working capital with a real intention and focus. And so we don't need a whole lot of growth to do that. It's a much more repeatable model. And I think we're encouraged by the trajectory of growth with the rebound in the end consumer here hopefully happening in the next 12 months. There's probably more upside than not, Howard, what did I miss?
Howard Yu: think that's right. And Arun, we are committed to buying back shares. I mean we're increasing how much we're buying back even this year. We've talked about it in the context of over $1.4 billion that we'll get through and essentially since mid-February, since the sale of Aerospace. And so obviously, that will have a meaningful impact on the share count going into next year and we'll continue to do that as well. The other thing I think to point out and we talked about during the Investor Day is the cost savings, gross cost savings that we're going to be undertaking. We've seen great traction. You're seeing some of that readout even in the numbers this quarter. You saw some of that in the first quarter as well. And you'll continue to see that well into 2024 and into 2025. And so there's no reason to expect that we're going to deliver anything less than 10%-plus, and probably ahead of that for the next couple of years, for sure, on the EPS side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist.
Mike Roxland: On this call and in some prior calls and also on the recent Investor Day, you mentioned improving plant efficiency, centralizing best practices, standardizing them, documenting processes, ensuring that all your facilities are sort of benchmarked with one another. How far along are you in that process right now? And if we think two to three years from now, what do you think this standardization, focus on cost takeout efficiency, what do you think it can add to the business in terms of dollars and profit?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I'd say we're early innings. And I think what this will allow us to do is consistently deliver against our 2 times growth percentage algorithm by gaining more productivity and efficiency in the plants and translating that into less capital required on the assets to grow into that, which historically has been a pretty big preventer of us from not achieving the 2 and 1. So translating that into dollars, I could tell you that's -- in theory, that's the strength for what we're doing. We're seeing it thus far and that should be fairly meaningful. I mean a 2 and 1 off of 2% to 3% growth over the next three years versus the 1.5 to 1, that's roughly the order of magnitude that we're trying to to fill the gap in, if that helps, Mike.
Mike Roxland: And then just one quick question in terms…
Dan Fisher: It's meaningful. I don't have a $1 per thousand number or cent per can number, but it is meaningful in terms of our ability to deliver organically higher end of that 2 to 1 range.
Howard Yu: And I think we've laid out that of the $500 million of gross savings, I mean, we're going to have a meaningful part of that will be front end loaded here in 2024 and 2025. But certainly, going into '26, '27 and beyond, as we aspire to be a best-in-class manufacturer, we will continue to see efficiencies there. I mean, as Dan said, we're early innings but we're putting up runs. And so that's a good thing to see as it relates to the corporation and what we're doing operationally.
Mike Roxland: So if you're still in early innings that means that you got this particular -- I mean, what's your time frame in terms of having everything standardized? In two years, three years, when do you think everything should be on par with one another?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I would give us somewhere in that two to three year range is what [indiscernible] myself are talking about, and it won't be 100% standardized, but 80%. And the reason I say that, you know this business is we got 40-year-old plants, we've got brand new plant. So we're not going to recapitalize to standardize everything. But the performance, the meeting cadence the S&OPs, all of that should look and feel like you're walking into a Ball plant everywhere in the world.
Mike Roxland: And then just one quick question. Obviously, you've now lapped the problem child product at this point. But it seems like Bud Light is now number three after Modelo Especial and Michelob ULTRA. So that really seems to be a more function for at least, as I can tell, a function of shelf space reset. So two part question. One, to the extent you can comment, has any of that decline been offset by gains in Michelob ULTRA? And two, do you think that Bud Light will ultimately regain some shelf space in the fall or the early winters as you noted when it occurs?
Dan Fisher: So two brands are growing within their portfolio. You mentioned one, the other one is, I believe, Busch Light. And so both of those are growing nicely. And so yes, they are filling some of the brands -- the portfolio whole. I'm encouraged by promotional activity in both those brands. And I think anything that Bud Light comes back and recovers is great, but they've got two real winners within that portfolio that they're leaning heavily into. And I think that's more probably the route that that wins and it also speaks to sort of brands on the different ends of the end consumer spectrum as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: First, just on aerosol. The business saw a nice, I think, 6% volume growth. I guess my understanding was this overall market is still a bit soft. So is there some competitive share gains, is it a mix with your extruded bottles? Just if you could help unpack that a bit, that would be helpful.
Dan Fisher: No, the market is growing probably half that rate globally, a little bit more than that. The advantage that we've got is strategically is our plants are able to produce bottles that have higher recycled content and we also make the alloys with the highest recycled content in the industry. And so the environmental and the sustainability message to somebody like a Unilever or a buyer store, they have a big packaging carbon issue. So if they could move into aluminum out of other substrates and we have the highest recycled content, we are winning disproportionately because of that. Not on price. In fact, it probably costs a bit more. But the light-weighting of the bottle on the less alloys, steel versus aluminum continues to be a positive trend. So there's a lot going into it. And we're very well positioned in the strategic partners and innovative partners and sustainability leads in that area. And we're bullish about that business moving forward because of the moat that we've created there.
Mike Leithead: And then I wanted to circle back to the US. Dan, you've given a lot of really helpful color around the different product category dynamics. But I want to circle back, I'm not sure if I heard in the answer to Ghansham's question earlier. But in 2Q, how did your US business for Ball perform relative to, say, the overall segment up one?
Dan Fisher: I think it's in line. It's actually the US was driving it more so than anything. Keep in mind, our Mexican business, if you -- 80% of it is products that go north. And it's one major brewer and they did well, that category didn't do great, but they did well. But everything was more or less in line, favorable CSD, flat energy, a decline in domestic beer, uplift in the imported beer. We participated in all those and net-net-net. Some of our customers within certain categories did a little better, so we did a little better. That's probably how it would shake it out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Bryan Burgmeier: This is actually Bryan Burgmeier on for Anthony. Maybe just a question on ‘24 EPS guidance, and I apologize if I missed this. Just thinking about kind of the magnitude of strong 2Q results, some modest tailwinds from lower interest expense, more share repurchases. It seems like there's maybe a tiny bit of upside to the full year guide versus your previous outlook. Is it South America and Argentina that makes you feel like reiterating is most prudent right now, so I know you reiterated volume growth expectations. So I'm just trying to kind of rectify the two different points.
Dan Fisher: Honestly, we're looking at the same thing you are. More constructive on the plus side of our guide. And when I hear the entire competitive landscape and our entire customer landscape, all saying similar things that we’re going to be delivered despite a little bit more volatile second half given the election, et cetera. I've been encouraged every month this year by the performance of the business and our commitment to doing the things that we can control, and those are going to continue. And then we have benefited a bit from mix in North America. Does that continue? I suspect it will. So yes, we're leaning to the plus side of that algorithm for sure.
Bryan Burgmeier: And last question for me, and then I can turn it over. Just can you comment maybe European can shipments versus underlying consumption growth in the region? Do you think that the industry maybe did a little bit of restocking this year or are brewers maybe ordering ahead for the summer? Just any color on maybe shipments versus consumption in Europe.
Dan Fisher: The destocking and restocking event that happened sort of December and then January and February. So Q1 had a little bit of that favorability in it. But what we've seen is this is actual consumption that's happening, a more aggressive pricing environment in some instances. I think if you talk to anybody in our industry, everybody is tight. We're getting very close to can allocation scenarios. So this is 100% consumption at this point, benefit from the euro, benefit maybe from the Olympics, but more of a benefit from just inflation dissipating in a different return of value equation by our customers needing to price differently. So all of that's been a healthy dynamic in Europe and fingers crossed that continues here for the foreseeable future. We do have some can share that's also helping in pockets of the EU, specifically the UK, they continue to move more into cans. So there's some different dynamics that are unique to each country and each category in each geography. But overall, yes, I'm really pleased with our performance in Europe and constructive on Europe at large right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Phil Ng: Pretty encouraging to see Brazil still up mid single digits. Argentina has been [problematic], it’s a little noise in general just all the movement. How would you like us to think about the back half? And certainly, you had outsized earnings last year from some mix dynamics in Brazil in the fourth quarter. So just kind of give us a little more color on do you have enough levers for your volumes to be up in South America given the weakness in Argentina, and then your ability to kind of drive earnings in the back half in South America as well?
Dan Fisher: There's an opportunity. I think Q3 will have still some volume decrement because of Argentina. Q4 will return to growth. But the earnings were already being impacted, Phil, in Argentina in Q3 because of some of the taxes that were being levied on, especially metal coming in from Brazil into Argentina dollars going out. There was a lot of currency controls put in place. So our margins -- our volumes held in, but our margins took a fairly significant hit and then further hit in Q4. So from a margin standpoint, you should see growth in the second half of the year. aAnd volumes will be flattish to slightly up with a negative tailwind still fairly significant in Q3 from Argentina, I think in the neighborhood of 500 million cans.
Phil Ng: So on balance on earnings is kind of muted is how I should think about it for Argentina [Multiple Speakers] margins might be better at budget…
Dan Fisher: You're right. From this point forward, it's muted. And here's what's going on in Argentina too. So for the last two months, they've got inflation down in the 4% range, and that was their target. What has also happened is there's been price fixing, there's a weak end consumer. This is the weakest the end consumer spend but they've accomplished all of their monetary and financial goals of lessening inflation. And so we're starting to see some easing in that country and then it's going to be employment based and sort of a return to a more stable end consumer there. But it’s -- I'm not an economist, but I'd say that they've kind of driven this thing where they wanted to and now I'm encouraged that we move up from here. It won't happen overnight but at least they've gotten us to a place that they were attempting to do in October and November of last year.
Phil Ng: I mean, I think certainly, there are some concerns coming into the quarter that mass beer in the US would be a drag, and you obviously put up really strong results in that segment in North America. If I heard you correctly, Dan, you sound a little more upbeat on the plus side of your mid single digit type growth. Does a lot of that come from North America or is it more Europe, some of the other segments, just because you're lapping that tough ABI comp, right, and you still put up 1% volume growth in 2Q. It sounds like your customers are promoting a little bit. Is that enthusiasm more on North America? And then are you expecting volumes perhaps to pick up a little bit in the back half?
Dan Fisher: I think every one of our business units, every one of our regions will make more money year-over-year in the third quarter. So there may be a little bit more weighting to your point. Actually, I think it's going to be more representative of a Q4 lift than a Q3 lift, just we've got such low inventory levels and really tight there in North America that you'll see some pickup on absorption more likely in Q4. But yes, leaning to the plus and as you know, this is -- a big portion of this is about mix and who wins in the third quarter. And I'm encouraged that premium light beer, domestic light beer, they're going to have to do something on pricing there. It's been a pretty similar tape, right Phil, for the last several quarters and so I think different behavioral patterns will have to kick in at some point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research.
Chris Parkinson: You hit on this a little bit, but I'd like to dive in a little bit more on the Brazilian market. Can you just talk about -- the last couple of years have been obviously pretty choppy, especially coming out of COVID. And there have been some substrate market shifts, obviously, changing and evolving consumer behaviors. Can you just kind of give us an update on where you think we are not only for the back half but where you think will ultimately be for '25, '26 as well as your competitive positioning?
Dan Fisher: So for -- I would say -- you're almost at a point where you can take COVID out of the equation. I think what happened in '23 -- so just '23 to '24 first half of the year, let me walk you through a comparative, right, for Brazil. In Brazil, the third largest brewery had a blowout 2023 first quarter, which we don't participate with. They filed for bankruptcy in Q2 of 2023. So they did virtually nothing in that quarter. So when you're looking at comps depending on who's with who and the mix trajectory in that category portfolio that there was volatility in one, we were up 26% in 1. So we benefited from that comp one. We didn't benefit from it as much in 2. But Q3, Q4 and Q1 of '23 and '24, the behemoth that we're with did well in the market. We continue to think that they will do well in the market based on innovation, based on share, based on their long term positioning. We're the number two player in the entire South America. They have been doing well as well. So I'm encouraged by the second half and I'm encouraged the economy in Brazil and the GDP is what really matters most at this point, to answer your follow-on question for '25 and '26, I think they have things going in the right direction, moderate-to-low inflation, employment continuing to improve, no sudden movements in terms of fiscal or monetary policy, all of that has a positive tailwind. And then the only thing that really comes out of COVID would be the substrate shift from glass into cans, and we're early innings on that. So we picked up probably 2 points of the 7 points that were lost and we expect to continue to pick up more of that in the back half of '25 and into '26. And then for us, our exposure to Argentina will be meaningful if there's abrupt recovery in Argentina in '25 and '26, that will -- obviously, we'll get 100% of that. So I'm constructive on the outlook. I think it will be at the higher end of our longer term growth algorithm based on the underlying conditions. And then Brazil, I think, starts to normalize a bit more. And it will be about mix but it will be less so about mix than what you saw in Q1 and Q2.
Chris Parkinson: And just a real quick one, not once but twice. I tried to get a beer after a round of golf in New York, and I was handed to a Ball aluminum cup and it's something people haven't really been discussing for quite some time, but they're starting to pop up a lot. And so I was just kind of curious what's the latest and greatest there in terms of your thought of trajectory? I mean it seems like it was kind of a thing and then it wasn't but now it's clear that you're making some additional strides. I'm just kind of curious on that front.
Dan Fisher: You do find it at places like that. I think ultimately, the backdrop, if you've got a weakened consumer and it's going to impact the volume on a project like that. And so we continue to gain traction but it's not near what we thought it would be two or three years ago. And so that's probably all I'll say about that for now. And we'll do one more question, Christine.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Stefan Diaz with Morgan Stanley.
Stefan Diaz: I hope everybody is doing well. In the release for Europe, you mentioned seasonal and sustainability trends should improve demand throughout the year. Does this mean you're expecting mid single digit volume growth for the second half as comps look favorable? And then maybe sort of following up on Bryan's question, considering can shipments seems like they were ahead of scanner for the latest quarter, are you worried about any potential destocking like we saw late in 2023?
Dan Fisher: I don't anticipate destocking for us, all of this stuff is like competitor and customer centric, right, on the destocking and stocking issues, nowhere near what you would have seen in '22 or '23. So I'm less concerned. Obviously, if volume were to fall off significantly, which we don't foresee or we're not anticipating, I might have to revisit that comment. But at this point, we've got incredibly low inventory levels. We're hand to mouth in Europe. We're in the throes of increasing our stacking in South America and then in North America, where we've got, like I said, historically low inventory levels that we'll need to manage that up over the second half of the year. So I'm encouraged and not concerned about that topic in particular. I get the question but for us, it's not as meaningful.
Stefan Diaz: And then given strong volume results in the past couple of quarters, I was just wondering if you could remind us if you still have any capacity curtailed within your network. And if so, maybe what do you need to see to bring that back online? And then maybe if you could also just quickly comment on what you think utilizations are by region?
Dan Fisher: You always have curtailments in South America this time of the year. We have very few, if any, curtailments in North America or Europe. Absolutely none in Europe right now. And the only thing that we would be curtailing would be one can size fits in North America at times. So all of that's good. The industry is in a really healthy position, probably high 80s, if I look at the annual projection, high 80s in Brazil, low to mid-90s in Europe and then low 90s in the US, which means you got excess capacity in shoulder season and you don't have any in peak season. And so it's in a good spot.
Operator: I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Dan Fisher: Thanks. Again, really appreciate our 16,000 employees. We had a flood and we've got some fires going on, and hope everybody remains safe and takes care of one another and look forward to talking with you all here at the end of the third quarter. So thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Potthoff, Investor Relations for Ball Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin. 
Brandon Potthoff: Thanks, Christine. 
 Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2024 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have the earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. 
 Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of noncomparable items as well as a reconciliation of comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. References to net sales and comparable operating earnings in today's release and call do not include the company's former aerospace business, year-over-year net earnings attributable to the corporation and comparable net earnings do include performance of the company's former aerospace business through the sale date of February 16, 2024. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fisher, CEO. 
Daniel Fisher: Thank you, Brandon. 
 Before we discuss Ball's strong earnings and improved volume performance, I would like to thank all of the Ball team members that worked tirelessly to achieve the successful aerospace business sale on February 16, 2024. 
 Sale proceeds were immediately put to work to reduce our leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and return value to shareholders. In addition, I would also like to share that Ann Scott has announced her retirement as Head of Investor Relations after 37 years with the company. Just this week, Ann's first grandchild, Isabella Ann, arrived safely into the world. Needless to say, we all know what Ann will be doing in retirement, babysitting, golf and being a lifetime Ball cheerleader. Ann will provide behind-the-scenes support to Ball through the end of the year. So as she winds down her time as a full-time employee, feel free to extend your well wishes via her Ball e-mail. 
 As you can tell from our call introduction today, our Investor Relations succession plan has been activated with Brandon taking the lead as the head of the department. Congratulations to Ann and her family on the new grand baby and her well-earned retirement and for your support of Brandon and Miranda as they take the next steps in their careers at Ball. 
 Today, I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss the first quarter financial performance and key metrics for 2024 and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. 
 Our team delivered strong first quarter results following the successful and earlier-than-anticipated sale of the aerospace business during the quarter. Global beverage can shipments increased 3.7% in the quarter, and we immediately executed our plans to deploy sale proceeds to deleverage and initiate a large multiyear share repurchase program. 
 Reflecting further on year-to-date 2024 performance, aluminum packaging continues to outperform other substrates across the globe. In North America and EMEA, first quarter volumes exceeded our internal expectations as customers pulled forward volume in preparation for the summer selling season, following notable fourth quarter 2023 destocking. 
 In South America, strong volume performance driven by our customer mix and warm weather continued in Brazil. For a complete summary of regional shipments for the first quarter, please refer to today's earnings release. Given seasonality, our customer mix and incorporating first quarter regional volume performance, we anticipate full year global shipments to grow in the low to mid-single digits range. 
 Key drivers in 2024 are the benefits of deleveraging, repurchasing shares, improving operational efficiencies and fixed cost absorption, and leveraging our well-capitalized plant assets to grow the use of innovative, sustainable aluminum packaging across channels, categories and venues. In addition, to further actions to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce long-term liabilities. 
 Based on our current demand trends and the previously mentioned drivers, we are positioned to grow comparable diluted EPS mid-single digits plus off 2023 reported comparable EPS of $2.90 per share, generate strong free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and return of value in the range of $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2024. We look forward to showcasing our team and unveiling our future operating model and long-term growth plans at our biannual Investor Day scheduled for June 18 in New York City at the New York Stock Exchange. 
 With that, I'll turn it over to Howard. 
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan. 
 Turning to our results. First quarter 2024 comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.68 versus $0.69 in the first quarter of 2023. First quarter sales decreased slightly due to the pass-through of lower aluminum prices and lower volumes in North America, offset by the pass-through of inflationary costs and increased volumes in South America.
 First quarter comparable net earnings of $217 million were flat year-over-year, primarily due to improved year-over-year performance in North America, EMEA and South America, offset by lower year-over-year results in nonreportable other, which were driven by improved comparable operating earnings in our aluminum aerosol business, being more than offset by noncomparable SG&A costs associated with the aerospace sale and higher year-over-year undistributed costs, which are detailed in footnote 2 of today's release. 
 In North America, segment earnings exceeded our expectations and offset notable year-over-year headwinds associated with the U.S. beer brand disruption and the favorable benefits of the virtual power purchase agreement termination. The earlier-than-anticipated closure of Kent plant, which permanently ceased production during the first quarter also aided results and supply-demand balance across our system. Benefits of effective cost management and plant efficiencies across our well-capitalized plant network will support incremental volume growth without spending incremental growth capital. We continue to anticipate sequential earnings improvement during the seasonal summer quarters, driven by modest volume improvement, improved fixed cost absorption and effectively managing risk. 
 In EMEA, the business continues to navigate varying consumer end demand conditions, particularly in Egypt. Overall, segment volumes were up slightly in the quarter following notable destocking by certain customers in late 2023. In recent weeks, demand trends have remained favorable, and the business continues to be poised for year-over-year comparable earnings growth in 2024, oriented largely to the second half and driven by volume and mix. 
 In South America, our segment volumes increased 26.3% in the first quarter, driven by strong demand in Brazil and our customer mix. The Brazilian can market was up 18% in the first quarter. We continue to monitor the dynamic economic situation in Argentina and potential scenarios that could impact results. We remain optimistic about Brazil and our ability to deliver sequential earnings and volume improvement as we exit the summer selling season in South America. 
 Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024 and up through the February 16 date of sale, our former aerospace business made $27 million of comparable operating earnings, which is included in the comparable net earnings of $217 million that I referenced earlier. 
 Moving on to additional key financial metrics and goals for 2024. We now anticipate year-end 2024 net debt to comparable EBITDA to below 2.5x. While we are currently at 2.2x at the end of the first quarter, net debt to comparable EBITDA will nudge slightly higher by year-end as the company starts payments of tax due on the gain of the sale of aerospace. 
 2024 CapEx is targeted to be in the range of $650 million, a year-over-year reduction of $400 million and largely driven by carry-in capital related to prior year's projects. We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target. Share repurchases are expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion by year-end. Through today's call, we have repurchased approximately $350 million in shares year-to-date, and earlier this week, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization to 40 million shares. The new authorization replaces all prior authorizations. This increased authorization will enable meaningful share repurchases during 2024 and beyond. 
 Our 2024 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 21%, largely driven by lower year-over-year R&D tax credit associated with the sale of the company's aerospace business. Relative to the estimated tax payments due on aerospace sale, the approximate $1 billion taxes due will be paid throughout the remainder of 2024. Full year 2024 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $320 million. Excluding the non-comparable aerospace disposition compensation costs, full year 2024 reported adjusted corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are still expected to be in the range of $85 million. And earlier this week, Ball's Board declared its quarterly cash dividend. 
 Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we remain laser-focused on operational excellence, driving efficiency and productivity across our business and cost management and monitoring emerging market volatility. We are committed to maximizing the full potential of our company over the long term. We have executed on derisking the corporation through recent debt retirements, and we have no significant near-term maturities. The runway is clear for us to activate near-term initiatives to consistently deliver high-quality results and generate compounding shareholder returns. 
 With that, I'll turn it back to Dan. 
Daniel Fisher: Thanks, Howard. 
 Given the strong start to the year in 2024, we anticipate growing our comparable diluted EPS mid-single digits plus by offsetting the divestiture through growth in our aluminum packaging operations, interest income, lower interest expense and the benefit of a lower share count. 
 Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our enterprise-wide strategy to advance sustainable aluminum packaging solutions on a global scale by accelerating our pathway to carbon neutral and unlocking additional value from within the organization by driving continuous process improvement and operational excellence. Together, we will strive to deliver innovative aluminum packaging solutions that can lead to a world free from waste and embark on a path to deliver compounding shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. 
 We very much appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. Thank you. 
 And with that, Christine, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. 
Ghansham Panjabi: First off, obviously, congrats to Ann, a huge resource for all of us and more importantly, a real class act and also our congrats to Brandon and Miranda also. 
Daniel Fisher: Thank you for that. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes. So I guess, maybe, Dan, you could start off with just the updated thoughts on the outlook by the various regions. And obviously, there's lots of issues with comparability and customer issues and so on and so forth. So what is the market -- what do the markets feel like at this point? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes, good question. I think South America, we saw the strength in the fourth quarter carried over in the first quarter, and our partner did kind of won today in the market down there. So a really good start to the year. I think as it relates to Brazil, I think that economy continues to incrementally improve. We took a little bit of the refill glass back that we've talked about, we lost over 18 months and sort of that higher inflationary environment. So that's positive. So that's inflecting in the right direction. I think we'll probably increment higher this year versus our outlook in Brazil. And then Argentina is hanging in there. Howard and I were down there about 4 weeks ago. They're having a good crop. They'll get the proceeds from selling those agricultural commodities around the world here in the next couple -- couple of months, and then that should unlock some of their FX policies, which will certainly benefit us and derisk the balance sheet in that part of the world. 
 Yes. So we're seeing growth. We're seeing slightly ahead in South America, writ large, that's the only country that's probably flattish to a little negative versus our going-in assumptions were -- was Chile, but it's really negligible in the grand scheme. As you know, it's really all about Brazil. And that's in a really good spot. 
 Europe, we saw growth ahead of what we anticipated. A couple of things are working in a favorable manner versus where we entered the year in terms of our assumptions. Number one, there was more destocking, I think, in Q4 across Pan-Europe and so I think some inventory levels got to a better position and look a lot closer to where they were heading into -- or prior to COVID. And then we're starting to see some pickup in the beer section in particular. So folks are going for volume a bit more than even we anticipated heading into the year in Europe. So that outlook looks great. 
 And then the watch out, of course, is going to be what happens in -- what happens in the Middle East and how that influences energy prices and the end consumer. But all the underlying parameters are slightly ahead of what we assumed heading into the year. So we're encouraged. Let's see how we get on in peak season. 
 And then Q1, I think, is the most challenging to architect and explain because of the year-over-year comparability. But the pull forward into -- from Q2 into Q1 for us had a lot to do with one major brewer that was dealing with labor negotiations. And so we had to build some safety stock to potentially navigate some challenges there. So think in the area of $15 million to $20 million was pulled in from Q2 into Q1 versus our original assumptions. The balance of it, though, Ghansham, is you're really starting to see all of the structural changes and effects that we've made over the last 18 months. So we've rightsized operations, but more importantly, we've taken the higher cost facilities out. And so as you get volume running against a more productive and efficient portfolio, you're starting to see those benefits. 
 So the timing impact, probably about $15 million, $20 million out of 2 into 1 overwhelmingly for 1 customer. And so for us, we -- our shipments are reflected at a much -- at a slightly higher rate in the underlying scanner data. And then within our portfolio -- within our portfolio, some of our customers won in their areas, CSD in particular, beer is soft, writ large versus, I think, what we even expected heading into the year. So mix is going to play a pivotal role, I think, within the industry and player by player. And right now, we're encouraged by the mix that we have. So it's still going to boil down to Q2 and Q3. Our customers are still going to go for volume and peak season and a great start to the year and slightly improved performance across the world is great, and let's see how we get on in the next 6 months. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Very comprehensive. And for the second question, it's really two parts. One is just a clarification. In Note A, you called out $17 million of corporate interest income. What does that refer to first off? And then second, the $5.5 billion or so of net proceeds from the sale it looks like net debt is down $3.8 billion sequentially, a couple of hundred million for share buybacks. And I see the working capital, but I'm still having a tough time reconciling to that $5.5 billion or $6 billion. Can you help with that also? 
Daniel Fisher: Sure. 
Howard Yu: Yes. So maybe -- Ghansham, this is Howard. I'd say that the interest income is specifically just related to the cash that we got on hand. So we got almost $5.5 billion -- or over $5.5 billion. And so that plays into the increased interest income associated with that. As it relates to... 
Ghansham Panjabi: Is that included in EBITDA, sorry to interrupt, but... 
Daniel Fisher: Yes, yes. 
Howard Yu: Yes. In the corporate line, that's right. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Sorry, go ahead. 
Howard Yu: Yes. And then as it relates to debt, yes, we anticipate that we would have paid down about $2.8 billion. Remember, the initial thoughts that we had in the quarter was that aerospace was being closed sometime after March 15. And so there was a European -- Euro-denominated debt that came due in the middle of March. And so we paid that down. So you couple that with the $2 billion that we referenced earlier around proceeds and where that would go. And so that's why you see the $2.8 billion debt retirement as well as knocking out some of the short-term debt and revolver and things like that, that we had. Clearly, with the cash on hand, we were going to go ahead and neutralize some of that interest expense as well. 
 And then we have talked about a $2 billion share repurchase over the next couple of years. I think we said that we were initially targeting about 2 -- $1 billion of share repurchase here in 2024. Given the timing of the sale, we're a little bit ahead of that. And so now what we said is that we're going to target about $1.3 billion worth of share buybacks here in 2024, consistent with the authorization that was approved by the Board earlier this week as well and the 40 million shares to be repurchased. 
 So -- and then everything else consistently, the CapEx, we anticipate that that's going to be about $650 million in the year, consistent with what we said. I think our interest expense at around $320 million is probably about $10 million better than we had originally indicated, and you're seeing that flow in as it relates to early timing as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. 
Anthony Pettinari: Congratulations to Ann and to Brandon and Miranda. I think I can't say enough good things about Ann and the job that she's done over the years. So congratulations. 
 Just looking at North America, I think if you back out the energy benefit from last year, EBIT was up almost 25% on kind of flattish or down volumes. You talked about the fixed cost reductions from plant closures. I'm just wondering if there's anything more than that or any kind of finer point you can put on that in terms of the cost that you've been able to take out as sort of the operational performance within North America? 
Daniel Fisher: I will take a shot at this and then ask Howard to just -- I think it's twofold. Yes, it's the fixed cost absorption. Straight line from the immediacy of the closure of the facilities and its improved performance across the portfolio. I think we've commented on this before. Probably versus 5 years ago, we've lost a couple of points, potentially 3 points of efficiency across our portfolio of assets in North America, and now we're gaining on that. So you're seeing the combination of the fixed cost benefits of the plant closures and the higher-cost facilities, coupled with the fact that we're running better. So a lot of folks that are now 2 or 3 years enroll in a number of these plants and they're performing better. So I think it's the combination of those two things. But one-offs, no. I mean, there were some -- there's always a few that are positive, and there's always a few that are negative. So I think it's really the underlying performance of the facilities in the region. They're doing a really nice job. 
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And then in South America, you had a great result with volumes up, I think, 26%, but EBIT up 10%. Can you talk about any kind of price cost dynamics in South America or the lag in -- the EBIT growth kind of lagging a bit. Is that Argentina related? Or just help us reconcile that? 
Howard Yu: Yes. Sure, Anthony. Let me go ahead and take a shot at that one there. I think South America was in its peak season. And so the way we think about it was -- and we talked about it in the Q4 earnings as well, Brazil was performing very well in that quarter as well. So really, you got to think about it in the context of the entire season and some of the mix and timing will change. And so if you think about what we said in Q4, the performance we had in Q4 in South America, we had about low single-digit growth of something around 2%, 2.5% growth and operating earnings was up 60%. And so coupling that with the performance here in the quarter at 26% volume growth and then 10% operating earnings. If you look at it holistically for both those quarters, we're up about 12% and over 40% as it relates to operating earnings. And so that's the way we think about it. Mix as it relates to cans and ends, those things will obviously play into this particularly in South America, and we're seeing that overall. So I think of it more in the context of the overall busy season for them and how successful it's been holistically. 
Daniel Fisher: In the simplest way, we've talked about this for years and years and years and you've heard us talk about. And can and end shipments, right? So we ship more ends in the fourth quarter than we did in the first quarter. So the balance of the entirety of the portfolio, really, that's where the volatility lies in terms of leverage, deleverage. It's not isolated within the quarter. You kind of have to look at it throughout the entirety of peak season. And that's the overwhelming gist of it. So we're happy with the leverage fall through with over the 6-month period. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. 
Arun Viswanathan: Just wanted to get your thoughts on how volumes in North America should evolve now that you're anniversary-ing the Bud Light situation. We've also heard of some share shifts within the industry. So yes, maybe you can just kind of give us your thoughts and if there's any category discussion that would be helpful or promotional kind of view as well. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. So we've spoken about, and I think it's well known within the industry that there was a share shift one brewer to the tune of approximately 2 billion units, that's already happened. That's in our numbers. So we lost the 2 billion and multiple competitors picked that up and incremented up. And we've got line of sight to fill that hole this year. If you go back to previous call and the assumptions we laid into North America for 2024, we thought we'd be negative obviously, in the first quarter, not only for the lapping the major brewer disruption, but the dislocation of this volume. And then we would -- which we've already won a couple of big chunks of business, and you will start to see that flow in, in the back half of the year. So that's where we geared toward flat in North America. So last -- the 2 billion pick up, roughly a similar amount and you'll inflect in the back half of the year with volume. Obviously, the size of that volume and the mix of that volume now plays out within the next couple of quarters, but you should still see increments of volume lift here out through the balance of the year in North America. 
 We think the industry is in that 1% to 2% growth range. Beer is a little softer, CSD is a little better. Mix will matter. Energy continues to grow. Mix will matter in promotional activity in peak season and the health of the end consumer, that's going to play out and determine whether it's 1%, 2%, a little north of that, a little south of it. But for us, we're really comfortable regardless of whether we're growing flat to down a little to up a little. We've got really good line of sight into the operating earnings and the cash generation of the business. 
Arun Viswanathan: Great. And then we've obviously seen some volatility on the aluminum price side. Maybe you can just comment on how that would impact you going forward? I mean I'm not sure if your customers -- I think they have some hedging programs in place, but would that also impact demand levels if they opt to push price to cover some of that inflation? And especially in Europe, I guess, I'm just curious if there would be any potential headwinds from metal premium pass-through? Or -- and how would you kind of characterize that in the context of -- it sounds like Europe is getting better from a supply-demand standpoint? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I think it's probably much ado about nothing at this point. We're coming off of incredibly low aluminum prices right now in a historical context. That seems to be the preferred package. There's a shift toward that in a number of parts of Europe. I guess the watch out is what's happening in the Middle East, right? I mean is that going to inflect significantly energy prices. Some mills and some aluminum is protected because it's nuclear power or it's tied up with other energy sources that aren't fed out of that part of the world, but it's certainly something that would impact the end consumer, not our customers' behavior patterns at this time. We're not having any conversations that would give us pause or concern. In fact, it's just the opposite at this point. They're more aggressively going in and working on taking share. and are using the can to do that. 
 So I think it's a watch out. It always is, but what we're seeing right now is not of a concern. And overwhelmingly, what everybody has learned, to your hedging question in particular, I think folks got caught a little upside down over the last 2 to 3 years in some instances. And I think they paid a lot more attention to hedge strategy and kind of protecting where they are. If they locked in hedges, they'd be locking in those hedges at kind of all-time low levels. So I'm a little bit more encouraged by the structure of the industry and the behavioral patterns. And then obviously, the watch out is what's going on in the Middle East and does that have any impact. 
Arun Viswanathan: Great. And congrats again to Ann and Brandon as well. Definitely, we'll miss speaking with her and getting her perspective. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. 
George Staphos: Thanks for the details. Everyone said it, but I'd like to as well. Just Ann congratulations, first on your grand baby, but also for being such a resource to all of us over the last number of years, you are the legend in the industry. And congratulations to Brandon and Carmen on their increased responsibilities. Okay. So in terms of operations, Dan, you had mentioned that you're still trying to claw back that 2% to 3% operating efficiency loss over the last few years. Where do you stand in that regard? Forgetting about the actual plant closure benefits. What do you -- where do you stand in terms of that recovery? And can you give us a 1 or 2 kind of for instance, in terms of how that lean or benchmarking is showing up on a day-to-day basis? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. We've got, George, latest numbers that I've seen. We picked up probably 1% of the 3% we've got back. And it's showing -- where it's showing up, principally, it's showing up in reduced over time. It's showing up in spoilage. The older assets that were retired, I would say, have contributed 80% of that improvement, okay? So there's still -- I think we've just scratched the surface on getting to the other 2%, 2.5%, if you will, across the existing portfolio of new assets. 
 So we still have a bit of runway. I mean, you could -- that's a meaningful number on when you apply it to roughly 50 billion units. And so we're in early innings. But as you know, volume to manifest in order for those efficiencies to show up, and we're inflecting here over the back half of the year. So we're counting on continued improvement. We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day and how we're structured in terms of the operating model, and we can point to this in, I think, more granularity than we've talked about historically. But I would say roughly, we've shuttered the facilities to pick up 1% of the 3%. And now we've got to work on the remaining assets that are in place to continue to grow into that too, and we're early innings on getting it, but it is showing up incrementally. 
George Staphos: Okay. I mean, I guess, we'll talk about it in June, but a pushback could be, okay, well, you got 1 point because you shut a facility and then the remaining 2 or 3 is going to be tougher to get at because it's got to come from ongoing. So do you have any comment on that? That would be great, if not, we can stay with the June. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I would say no, that's not true. It's going to be easier because this is roughly 1,200 new employees that are 3 years of service in and they're learning how to make cans. And so this is incremental in terms of the learning curve. This is not different than at any point in time when we talk about an 18-month, 24-month ramp-up on facilities. I think about it in that context. So if we focus, we maintain -- we don't have attrition at the levels that you did, obviously, during COVID. We will gain on this and we will gain on this in a pretty methodical and pragmatic and a very prescriptive manner. So I'm encouraged that we will get this back here over the next 18 to 24 months. 
George Staphos: Next question. So in Brazil and sort of piggybacking on what Anthony had teed up. Was there any sort of operating issues in terms of the lack of profit leverage versus the volume leverage? Again, I know you said we should look at it holistically. Were there -- did you lose any share to your knowledge with any customers recognizing in a quarter where you're growing 18% or whatever the number might have been depending on the customer or the market, the answer is probably no. But any operating issues that we should take away? Any customer loss issues or if things were very much as expected in the quarter in South America and in Brazil? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Thanks. So Brazil grew at 18%, we grew at 26%. So no, we didn't lose anything. In fact, you could say we incremented share positions. If this is 100%, George, just to be clear, it is end sales that were heavier mix in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter. And so that's what it is. So we shouldn't have been up 60% earnings on 2% growth in the fourth quarter. So if you kind of mix that end issue, which we've talked about forever in a day, it's just lumpy, and it's incredibly profitable because of the tax jurisdictions down there. It's like -- that's it. Yes, nothing fundamental. It's not Argentina. It's not anything that -- it's no pricing mechanisms and contracts, All of that's really stable. It's just fundamentally to end float between 4 and 1. 
George Staphos: Understood. My last two ones quick. Number one, just piggyback again on the aluminum question, recognizing it's a watch out, but not something you're terribly concerned about. I know over the last couple of years, 3 years, you've probably been working on supply chain, clearly, with a lot of this inventory now showing up -- or a lot of this aluminum showing up in inventory and warehouse that might not be able to be used because of the sanctions. What are the risks and how are you planning against it that if there is some sort of mill disruption somewhere around the world that we don't see some spike, some tightening in an aluminum therefore can sheet, what are your thoughts there and how you're planning against that? 
 And then last, can you just give us a little bit more color on the payout that was related to the aerospace sales? Again, congratulations. It was obviously a favorable valuation. But kind of what went into that number? Congratulations on 1Q. 
Daniel Fisher: Thank you very much. So we've learned a lot. This may be a little long-winded answer in terms of our price cost and managing the risk, managing tariffs, managing sanctions as it relates to your inventory supply. We've gotten a lot better at this since the tariffs were put in place in 2016. We've got 21 different metal programs. So metal that would be of concern on sanctions, we're really not shipping it to countries where that's even in conversation. So it will be going to places that it can be used, where there's trade relations with those countries that may have some concerning trade routes or unintended consequences for what -- exactly what you described. 
 So we're managing those. We've derisked that over the last handful of years, and we've gotten -- we've gotten pretty good at that, understanding what's going on relative to those conversations and how we get out ahead of it. So I'm -- it's less of an issue. I agree. I mean, 4 or 5 years ago, we spent in an inordinate amount of time on things just like that because it wasn't in the ethos, it wasn't in our management patterns and our cadence of conversations, in our S&OP process. But I think it's pretty well under control, not to say that the world is not going to change here suddenly, and we need to manage it. But I would put this in the category of very low risk for us at this point in terms of just how we're managing our portfolio. 
 And then I'll let Howard weigh in on some of the proceeds comments again. 
Howard Yu: Sure. So I think, first and foremost, George, that is a noncomparable compensation component associated with the aerospace sale. Part of the variable performance-based compensation plan for Ball employees. I think the way we think of it is the magnitude of the impact of this disposition causes the expense to be not normal. And so we've recognized approximately a $4.7 billion gain on this disposition which is unprecedented, of course, and not likely to ever recur. And so for that reason, we're treating that as a noncomparable compensation component associated with that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. 
Edlain Rodriguez: Again congrats to Brandon and Miranda and Ann, we're going to miss you. Quick one on Europe. Clearly, a better start to the year, better than expected. But are you seeing any fundamental improvement in terms of consumer spending improving? Because everything else we hear about you about -- like things were improving quite a bit. Like what was the surprise, what are you seeing there? 
Daniel Fisher: Great. Yes. So I think it's twofold. I wouldn't say end consumers are spending more. I would say the relative inflation versus payroll mechanism and then the promotional activity for our customers is impacting and influencing volume. And the other piece is the -- I think there was an unwind to an unnatural inventory level by retailers, by our customers at the end of Q4. And so they built that up a little bit. So it's probably half of Q4 to Q1, if you will, inventory stocking, getting back to a more normalized baseline. And then some -- really some more aggressive behaviors from the customers. across Europe that has enabled a little bit more volume. It's not incredibly exciting, but it's better than we anticipated heading into the year. 
 But I wouldn't say there's more spend by going into these categories, I would say it's a little bit substrate shift, little bit favorable category, the can certainly winning versus the other substrates. That gap has widened probably more in Europe than in any other region relative to the trade-offs from glass and plastic into cans. So we're the beneficiary of that, but I wouldn't chalk it up to -- there's a lot more spend happening. I think we're the beneficiaries of the mix. 
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. Makes sense. And another one, in terms of like the share repurchase, I mean then, like how do you balance the pace of that share repurchase? Like with your commitment to buy back shares versus like a higher and higher share price. I mean, of course, it's a high-class problem to have, but how do you balance the pace of that? 
Howard Yu: Yes, Edlain, I think we're committed to getting back to it. I mean we had, I think, had a pause for a few years as it relates to share buyback, and I think that we've consistently heard from our shareholders as well that returning that in some measurable fashion and on a consistent basis is important. And so we're just starting in this program, right? I think we've mentioned that we bought about $350 million worth of shares here. And we'll be thoughtful, clearly, as to how the stock price is going. And even as it relates to what vehicles we use to buy back some of that share. We do have a long history of utilizing different instruments. I mean the 10b-18 when the blackout is not there and the 10b-51 when the blackout is there, and then we'll look at things like smaller ASRs as well if the volatility and the economics work for us. 
 And so we're looking at all those things holistically in conjunction with the board and we're being thoughtful about them. What we do believe that for this year, we'll spend about $1.3 billion worth of share buyback. Combined with our dividend policy, that will return about $1.5 billion back to the shareholders. 
Daniel Fisher: And then relative to elevated stock price. I mean we're very comfortable in buying back our shares at this level still, that's absolutely something that we talk to our finance committee and our board with and we model things internally. And yes, we're very comfortable returning value back to our shareholders right now at these levels and even elevated above this. So -- but it's definitely something that we'll look at. But where the stock is, even trading up today, it's like we're very comfortable buying back shares at this level. So it's a great question. And it's, hey, let's see how we get on here over the next 3 to 6 months, but I think we owe it to return value back to our shareholders at the levels that we're talking about for the foreseeable future. And it's just a good -- it's a really good mechanism in behavior return value if we're generating more free cash flow, generating more earnings, we have plenty of dry powder to do things as they present themselves in terms of bolt-on M&A, et cetera. So I think we can do all of it. And that's kind of how we're looking at it at this point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. 
Adam Samuelson: Let me extend also my congratulations to Ann on her retirement and addition to the family. Maybe I wanted to come back to the cash flow side first. Maybe, Howard, I just want to clarify, you bought that -- you talked about $2.8 billion of debt in the quarter. I believe that was higher than what had been initially kind of targeted, maybe there's some timing component to that. Did you also reduce the factoring programs on receivables? Or is that a cash outflow that is still yet to occur is obviously a lot of moving pieces on the balance sheet, I'm trying to make sure we understand what has happened and what has not in the cash... 
Howard Yu: Yes, Yes, no problem, Adam. So yes, we did retire $2.8 billion of debt that was -- we had talked about it from an apples-and-apples standpoint of about $2 billion, but recognizing that, that was anticipating the sale of aerospace sometime after the March 15 date. March 15, we had to do about EUR 750 million denominated debt that was retired. And so that equates to the essentially additional USD 800 million of that gets us to the $2.8 billion in the quarter. .
 As it relates to factoring, given the cash that we had on hand, we did move forward with the factoring in a meaningful way. We still -- we probably did more of the unwinding here in the first quarter than we would anticipate for the full year. And so that was to the tune probably about $1.1 billion. But by year-end, we're going to stay with our goal -- specified goal and target of unwinding about $0.5 billion of AR factoring by the end of this year. So you'll see that going a little bit the other way throughout the course of this year as we have a $1 billion tax payment that we're going to have to make here in second half -- or actually in second quarter and through the second half as well. 
Adam Samuelson: Okay. That's very helpful. And if I could maybe just follow up as we maybe take a step back because there's a lot of moving pieces within comparable EPS growth off the $2.90 last year that obviously had aerospace earnings in it. You pay off debt, there's interest income, reduced factoring expense, share repurchase, tax rate inches up. Maybe if we step back and we think about the 3 core beverage can kind of operating units, globally, Dan, you talked about low to mid-single-digit volume growth, what should we think about the operating profit growth in those core business units off that level of growth? Obviously, in the first quarter, especially North America, had some -- had some favorability, but help us think about what that core operating leverage to look like with that kind of volume growth this year? 
Howard Yu: I would say overall, Adam, that we anticipate operating leverage to continue on here, and you'll see that. What we've said as it contextualizes EPS as we've said, hey, mid-single-digit plus on a year-over-year basis. We've said that the aerospace sale would essentially be neutral for us on an EPS standpoint, given the operating earnings loss associated with aerospace, but the pickup associated with the -- with the additional cash, whether it be interest income, reduction in interest expenses, we've retired debt. And as we go ahead and improve on some of these factoring programs. So we've said that for the full year, the EPS would be neutral associated with the aerospace sales. Think of it in the context of a 2x leverage. And so that's the way we think of it within the P&L. And so that's consistent with what we've modeled. That's consistent with what we're going to see here through the duration of 2024. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I think for the core beverage business, if you -- it's significantly higher than the historical 2x leverage if you were to back out the nearly $40 million of onetime purchase power agreement. So it's still in excess of the 2x leverage. I think somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million of operating earnings we're going to get out of the beverage business and an improved result year-over-year and that obviously has the lapping of the $40 million -- $30 million, $40 million onetime benefit. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. 
Philip Ng: Congrats on the strong quarter. And like everyone else, I wanted to thank Ann for all her help over the years, and congratulations to Brandon and Miranda as well. I guess my first question is really the free cash flow power of the business, certainly noisy with the aerospace sale this year. Can it be helpful, Howard, perhaps to give us a little more perspective on how you think about CapEx as we look out to 2025 and beyond, maybe 2026? It's been a big growth CapEx cycle. So just give us a little more context on how to think about that, the free cash flow and certainly a high-class problem to have, but how should we think about buyback as well? Pretty steady dose every quarter, more opportunistic if the pullback? Just kind of give us a little playbook and how you're thinking about the pace of buybacks. 
Howard Yu: Yes. So sure, Phil. Let me go ahead and get into that a little bit. As it relates to free cash flow, I mean, I think the way to think of it is, say, we're anchoring to a normalized free cash flow in the $900 million to $1 billion range, right? That excludes some of the impact of the factoring unwind, and we talked about that in the context of about $0.5 billion, right? So -- and I think that we can see that going forward on a consistent basis. Dan has talked about the operating cash generation of this business and how rich that is. And so we believe that that's going to help fuel the share buyback even into years that you specified. 
 As it relates to CapEx, I mean, the way we think about it here is getting CapEx in the ballpark of GAAP D&A on a consistent basis. I recognize that over the last few years, that CapEx had been a little bit outgrown. And so we're returning back to that discipline of getting CapEx into the D&A envelope. And we think that, that's going to happen here for the next few years as well. 
 As it relates to share buyback, look, as Dan said, I mean, we feel good about the price that it's at and we'll continue to buy if there is any, for any reason at all, reason for us to be a little bit more opportunistic because of the prices, then we'll look at that as well. And so I think that we have those full optionality. I think the greater point here to know is that we're going to return to a consistent buying back of shares, something that we had paused on for a few years here, and we'll do that here in 2024. We'll do that here in 2025. And no reason to think that we wouldn't do that going forward beyond that. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes, Phil, I would say -- I would -- in the simplest manner, we are running our business, the expectation of running our business enterprise-wide is that net income equals free cash flow. So as I don't want you to think about locking us in at $900 million of free cash flow. As our margins expand, we will mitigate the working capital build associated with the growth. And if you're in that 2%, 3%, 4%, you should be able to manage that. We got room to do that. We spend that GAAP D&A levels and some years it will be less, some years it might be a bit more. But this -- we should be generating a steady diet of free cash flow and returning that back to our shareholders consistently. To your point, there may be some opportunities with a pullback where we can do some more. But I think you should be locking in that you're going to get an overwhelming majority of that free cash flow coming back to you in the form of dividends and share buybacks, over $1 billion share buybacks for the foreseeable future. 
Philip Ng: Okay. That's great. And Dan, you gave a little more perspective on Europe. It sounds like still kind of a choppy environment, but good to see some restocking. How are your customers gearing up for the busy summer months. Certainly, there's big -- some big sporting events like the Olympics and the Euros and stuff of that nature. Are they gearing up for that? And then I think on your prepared remarks, you made some comment about perhaps Europe's recovery would be more back half-weighted. Give us a little more perspective why perhaps the back half is a little better than the front half? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Entering the year, it was really the comments were more macro related and end consumer and the strength of the end consumer. We got the benefit of the restock and a little bit more favorable behavior by our customers kind of pushing volume. But we thought that there would be a natural tendency for inflation to come back and for the regasification projects that come online. So there would be more room for optimism in the second half of the year, and that's really what we heard from our customers as well. 
 Your point about the Euro Cup certainly is helpful. I'm more -- I get more excited about the soccer "football" drinking behaviors than I do about the Olympics drinking behaviors. So that generally moves the needle a lot more than the Olympics, if you will. So that will be helpful, and we've certainly heard that from -- especially our larger beer customers and elements of Western Europe. So yes, it's really macro related. And I think a lot of those things are still playing out in a more favorable manner with the watch out being what happens in the Middle East as it relates to energy prices and how does that impact the end consumer. But we're encouraged. 
 Nothing contractual is coming online. It's incredibly stable. This is just -- and we're starting to see increments of better pricing behaviors, a little stronger end consumer, substrate shift continues to manifest in a favorable manner for us, especially as it relates to glass moving into cans. So a bunch of small things kind of add up to a more improved outlook in the second half of the year. And we haven't seen anything that would influence or impact that to the negative, if anything, may be an increment higher. 
Philip Ng: Got it. And then just one more for me. On North America, if I heard you correctly, you had some pull forward earnings from 2Q to 1Q. Do you still expect North America earnings to be up year-over-year in 2Q. And then give us a little update. I think there's been some movement in North America as well with the shelf space reset on the beer side. And one of your larger peer customers, I believe, is still dealing with some ongoing labor issues, I think, down in Texas. Any update on that front and how you're kind of managing that? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes, I'll let -- Howard, why don't you cover the earnings, and I'll get back over to the union issues. 
Howard Yu: Yes. I think that's right, Phil. I do think that year-over-year earnings will still increment upwards here in the second quarter despite some of the pull-in from Q2 to Q1. I think as Dan said, it's probably $10 million or $15 million that improved the first quarter. But despite that, we still anticipate that we'll have some reasonable growth as it relates to operating earnings in the second quarter as well. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I think the shelf resets have been communicated really well from -- there's been a couple of folks that have won disproportionately, and we anticipated that in our numbers. So nothing's moved up, down or sideways. I would say, even with -- even with the shelf reset, I think the beer category is down. So I think it's less about the category reset, and it's more about beer and how they get on with promotional activity in the peak season, are they going to drive value -- excuse me, volume. 
 And then, yes, we're connected with our plants in Texas with that particular brewer. They're doing a really nice job of managing it right now, but it's still ongoing. It hasn't been resolved, but we're certainly working with our partner to make sure that we're running what we can, and it's being effectively managed. And I think this is a bit of the way of the world right now as it relates to some of the strength of the unions, broadly speaking, and kind of the manufacturing base. So we had to also work with another major brewer in the quarter to work toward mitigating any supply chain shifts and -- so I think we're all coming to a realization that this is probably par for the course moving forward, and everybody is getting aligned to have more thoughtful conversations in and around when these contracts come up across the industry and making sure that collectively throughout the system, we can manage them. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. 
Stefan Diaz: This is actually Stefan Diaz sitting in for Pam. And just to echo my colleagues, congratulations to Ann and Brandon and Miranda for the increased responsibility. Now that the aerospace deal is closed and proceeds are in hand. Can you give any details around the potential innovation investments? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. It's a good question. So we're always -- I guess we have an underlying thought process that we're always investing. There's a combination of R&D that transition that hopefully in the commercial innovation projects. And I think you'll hear this from just about everyone that the opportunity set for us is different by region, but innovation as it relates to getting a constructive package and vehicle that can really attack, if you will, plastic. And the big linchpin there is going to be resealability. And I think there's a lot in that area that's being worked on and it's being worked on by everyone in the industry and all of our customers. So that -- those will be the big unlocks. 
 And then there's some pretty interesting stuff that's going to be coming out as it relates to new products. And it's also -- these are also applications that benefit substrate shift. I think that's the real focus of innovation more so than a unique graphic depiction, et cetera. It's like can you have a package that is easily transferable into whatever the benefits of the other substrate are, and can you offset those and then you've got a far more circular and a better, I think, sustainable package that gets supplant that. And so that's where that focus is. 
 And then in terms of new products, there's a lot -- there's a lot that's happening in the CSD space. There's a lot happening, better health, lower calorie, lower sugar, that's all real. And then very creative outlooks as it relates to alcohol categories, new alcohol categories and then substrate application for us. That's where the innovation is. But I would say nothing that would be incrementally different in terms of our spend behavior just because we have a stronger balance sheet. These are things that we're working on and working on with our partners. And as it makes sense and as it can be commercialized at scale, we're generally the right person, right company to do that. And so that's how we're looking at innovation right now. 
Stefan Diaz: Great. And then I believe your initial volume guide was for low single digits globally, and now you expect low single digit to mid-single digits. Is the raise at the top end based on strong 1Q? Or do you expect better demand throughout the year now? And maybe what do you need to see to hit the top end of that guide? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Peak season dependent. Just to be abundantly transparent. I mean if I'm talking about 3.4% growth versus 3.3%, I think the 3.3% starts to look like mid-range versus -- so I would say we got out ahead of the gate. We had favorable mix in South America. We're a little ahead in Europe. Scanner data is a little behind in North America. So the balance of that seems like net-net-net, that's a little favorable. Until we get through peak season on 70% of our business, I think I've ranged it appropriately. And regardless of whether it's low single digits or mid-single digits, you're going to see cash flow generation, EPS mid-single digit plus share buyback to the tune of nearly $1.3 billion. So we're really confident in the underlying performance and behavior of the business. Let's see how peak season gets on. 
Stefan Diaz: Great. And maybe if I could sneak one more quick one in here. Can you just go through how April trends are benchmarking versus your expectations? 
Daniel Fisher: Yes, April is largely in line, a little softer than March, but in line with our expectation. And as you know, Easter fell a week different last year than it did this year. And so that plays into it a bit. So it's -- I think it's there or thereabouts. And it really -- a couple of weeks before Memorial Day is when things really start to pick up. So it's really the back half of the second quarter where it's most meaningful. 
 Christine, that will be the last question. I think we're a couple of minutes over. 
Operator: This ends the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Thanks. I just -- just a quick reminder, June 18, New York Stock Exchange is our Investor Day. Again, I'd like to thank Ann for her incredible service to the company and certainly echo all the very nice comments toward Brandon and Miranda. And thanks to all of our employees. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of the next quarter, if not before at Investor Day. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Dan Fisher, CEO. Thank you, sir. You may begin. 
Daniel Fisher: Thank you, Christina. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website@ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes Section of today's earnings release. In addition, the release includes a summary of non-comparable items, as well as a reconciliation of comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Before we discuss Ball's strong earnings and cash flow performance, I would like to remind call participants that on August 17, 2023, the company announced an agreement to sell its aerospace business. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions and adjustments. Relative to the company's aerospace divestiture, which is projected to close in the first half of 2024, certain forward-looking financial metrics provided in today's earnings release and conference call commentary may differ from those expressed or implied due to the timing of a successful closing of the timing of the proposed use of proceeds. Today I'm joined on our call by Howard Yu, EVP and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks. Howard will discuss 2023 financial performance and key metrics for 2024, and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. Our team delivered strong operations-driven fourth quarter results and for the full year. We achieved double-digit comparable operating earnings growth and generated $818 million in free cash flow. 2023 also delivered a dynamic set of strategic decisions and factors that influenced results and sharpened Ball's vision for the future, including our decisions to sell aerospace for a premium valuation and to reduce fixed costs by adjusting our manufacturing footprint and factors that influenced year-over-year results, such as a large U.S. customer experiencing major brand disruption, an $86 million comparable operating earnings headwind due to the Russian business sale, and the effect of Argentine hyperinflation and currency devaluation. Late in 2023, we also had the good fortune of welcoming Howard to Ball. Many of you listening have already had the pleasure of meeting with Howard at multiple conferences and our investor community welcome reception in November. His financial expertise, engaging nature and fresh eyes are adding value out of the gate and activating another stage of continuous improvement actions at Ball. Over our 144-year history, each year has presented its opportunities, challenges and changes, and the legacy of how the Ball team continuously adapts to position the company for long-term success is the reason we are all here today. I'm proud to say that the resiliency of our team and our chosen substrate, aluminum packaging, combined with improving plant and program execution, more than offset the earnings impact of challenges experienced in 2023. And there were and are many more things to be done to make the most of our opportunities. Reflecting further on 2023, our customer mix and inflationary effects on end consumer demand drove our shipments. Global shipments ended 2023 down 3.3%, excluding Russia sale impact, and shipments would have ended the year roughly flat versus 2022, absent the U.S. brand disruption issue. All-in, the aluminum package industry continues to outperform plastics and glass packaging. For Ball, continued volume strength in Brazil and better than expected volume in North America to close out 2023 offset regional softness in Argentina and EMEA. For a complete summary of regional shipments for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, please refer to today's earnings release. Looking ahead, our global teams are energized by recent commercial wins and other constructive customer discussions to continue packaged mix shift to cans. We will continue to advance sustainability of aluminum packaging by accelerating our pathway to carbon neutral and leveraging the scale of our footprint, innovative portfolio, and value chain partnerships to expand opportunities for our customers over the long-term. Given seasonality, our customer mix, and the April 2024 anniversary of the U.S. customer brand disruption, we anticipate year-over-year volume growth to favorably inflect after first quarter 2024 and accelerate further in 2025. Significant opportunity lies ahead to offset the financial impact of the projected aerospace sale and to drive compounding value creation for our fellow shareholders. Key drivers in 2024 will be the utilization of net proceeds from the aerospace sale to deleverage and repurchase stock, improving operational efficiencies and fixed cost absorption, leveraging our well-capitalized plant assets to grow the use of innovative, sustainable aluminum packaging across channels, categories, and venues, in addition to further actions to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce long-term liabilities. Based on our current demand expectations and the potential timing and benefits of the aerospace sale proceeds, we are positioned to grow comparable diluted EPS, generate strong free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet, and accelerate return of value to shareholders in 2024. We look forward to showcasing our team and unveiling our future operating model and long-term growth plans at our biennial Investor Day scheduled for June 18th in New York City at the New York Stock Exchange. And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard.
Howard Yu: Thanks Dan. Over the first few months of my onboarding and immersion, I have learned more about the business by visiting our teams in North America, South America, and EMEA, toured multiple manufacturing facilities to see how our innovative products are made, and attended several investor events where I've had the opportunity to meet many of you on this call. It has become more apparent what a terrific workforce we have around the world and what a tremendous opportunity we have in front of us to make an impact for our customers, shareholders, and communities. I would like to thank my global colleagues, investors, and analysts who have taken the time to give me such a warm welcome. Turning to our results. 2023 full year comparable diluted earnings per share was $2.90 versus $2.78 in 2022. And fourth quarter 2023 comparable diluted earnings per share was $0.78 versus $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 4.3% and 77.3%, respectively. Full year sales decreased due to the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, lower beverage can volumes, and the sale of our Russian business offset by the pass-through of inflationary costs and increased volumes in our aluminum aerosol. Full year comparable operating earnings increased nearly 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the contractual pass-through of inflationary costs, fixed cost savings, and benefits of our prior year SG&A cost-out initiative offsetting the headwinds in the sale of our Russia business and lower volumes. The global operations team finished the year strong, hitting their CapEx, raw, and finished inventory goals, setting the stage for continued improvement of better fixed cost absorption in 2024, particularly after we anniversary the customer brand disruption and cease production in the Kent plant in the first quarter of 2024. Versus recent years, we anticipate our production aligning with shipments as we step into incremental volume growth later in 2024. In North America, supply demand has tightened up following the footprint adjustments, and we continue to focus on lowering costs across our well-capitalized plant network and driving incremental volume growth without spending incremental capital. Exiting 2023, PPI remains a net positive. Non-alcohol global key accounts have started to gain traction in retail, and we continue to prepare for additional modest volume improvement after the first quarter and net of historic customer shifts. In EMEA, the business nearly filled the $86 million comparable operating earnings hole from the Russia business sale and continue to navigate varying consumer end demand conditions, particularly in Egypt, Turkey, and the U.K. The business is poised for year-over-year comparable earnings growth in 2024, largely in the second half. In South America, our volumes increased 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, despite ongoing weakness in Argentina. We continue to monitor the situation in Argentina and potential scenarios that could impact results. We remain optimistic about Brazil, with January volumes off to a good start as the summer selling season continues. Our non-reportable results led by aluminum aerosol 8.2% volume growth and double-digit operating earnings growth finished 2023 strong. Moving on to additional key financial metrics and goals for 2024. We achieved our year-end 2023 net debt to comparable EBITDA goal of 3.7 times, and incorporating the use of projected aerospace sale proceeds and strong cash generation in 2024, we anticipate year-end 2024 net debt to comparable EBITDA to be in the range of 2.7 times. 2024 CapEx is targeted to be in the range of $650 million, a year-over-year reduction of $400 million, and largely driven by carry-in capital related to prior year’s projects. 2024 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $500 million, excluding the [technical difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold. Your conference will resume momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, your conference may now resume.
Howard Yu: Cash flow is expected to be in the range of $500 million, excluding the impact of taxes due on the projected aerospace sale. Our 2024 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings, including the effect of projected aerospace sale, is expected to be approximately 21%, largely driven by lower year-over-year R&D tax credit. Full year 2024 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $330 million, including the impact of lower leverage following the successful aerospace closing. Full year 2024 corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable as expected to be in the range of $85 million and more first half-weighted versus last year. And last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend, and we look forward to reinitiating meaningful share purchases during 2024 and beyond. Also, a call-out about tough year-over-year comps we face in the first quarter of 2024, driven by North America and corporate costs. Due to the 2023 favorable virtual power purchase agreement settlement, totaling approximately $30 million and a similar impact of the customer brand disruption, which does not anniversary until April of 2024, North America earnings and volumes will be down year-over-year in the first quarter. Looking at 2024, we will be laser-focused on operational excellence, driving efficiency and productivity across our business, optimizing SG&A costs, and offsetting stranded costs post-aerospace divesture. In addition to strengthening our balance sheet by deleveraging and other actions. We are committed to delivering value through share repurchases and dividends, and will communicate and stay close to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks Howard. As we continue to make progress in 2024, we anticipate growing our EPS and offsetting the divestiture through growth in our aluminum packaging operations, interest income, lower interest expense, and the benefit of a lower share count. Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our enterprise-wide strategy to advance sustainable aluminum packaging solutions on a global scale by accelerating our pathway to carbon neutral and unlocking additional value from within the organization by driving continuous process improvement and operational excellence. Together, we will strive to deliver innovative aluminum packaging solutions that can lead to a world-free from waste and embark on a path to deliver compounding shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes for a prosperous 2024 to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and everyone listening today. Thank you to everyone listening, and with that, Christina, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please receive with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody.
Daniel Fisher: Hey, good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Morning. Dan, maybe you could just start off just kind of giving us the base case for volume assumptions across the different geographies you have exposure to for 2024. I know you made some comments on the first quarter, but how do you think the full year is sort of going to unfold with all these ups and downs across the statements, Europe starting to decelerate and obviously comps in North America?
Daniel Fisher: Sure. Yeah, so I think in Europe, what you'll see is -- I think in both Europe and North America, you'll see volumes get better. Sequentially, I think you'll start to return to growth somewhere in the second quarter in North America and you'll see growth in the second, third and the fourth quarter in Europe as well. As we've -- North America is unique, obviously, because we're lapping the difficult comp there, but we'll get to flat for the full year in that range, maybe a little better. But you'll start to see sequential improvement towards the end of the year and then heading into 2025 will be kind of in that growth range of 2% to 3%, I believe heading into 2025. That being said, Ghansham, it's early days, but we're a little ahead here in January, really in all three regions. That should be noted. So, it's only one month, obviously, but we're actually seeing positive inflections in the U.S. for the last four weeks, slightly favorable. And for one week, we're favorable. And that's the first time in a couple years that we've seen that. So, knock on wood off to a decent start. I'm not overly excited, but it's better than it has been. So that's a positive. And then in South America, we believe like mid single digit growth. Brazil continues to be strong for us. Our exposure to the other markets will play a role. Argentina is a little ahead of what we thought it would be from a plan basis. But that's still down year-over-year. But I think a lot of the changes that the executive branch made in Argentina, they're coming off as a little bit more favorable than I think a lot of the world thought would happen from macroeconomic standpoint at the tail in the last year. So, we're a bit encouraged there, but it is Argentina. Let's see what happens. So, 2% to 3% growth globally mid to high single digits for South America, low mid single digits for Europe and flattish with a lean that we could get a little bit of growth in North America for 2024.
Ghansham Panjabi: Great. You need Taylor Swift to push cans.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then second question, the call kind of cut out during -- I just want to make sure I understood the free cash flow was $500 million for 2024. And if so, what are the embedded assumptions in there? I know you gave cash interest, I mean, interest expense, because we're having a tough time getting to that number with $650 million.
Daniel Fisher: Sure, Ghansham. So, let me try to walk you through that a little bit. I think we have a tax payment that's going to be associated with the aerospace divestiture that runs through our operating. And so, obviously, it's going to impact our free cash flow. We have talked about a $650 million CapEx number that we anticipate as well. And then what we're doing, and we talked about a little bit in the third quarter, but here in 2024 we will be unwinding some of the factoring the balance sheet AR that we've historically used. And so that will obviously be an outflow from a cash flow perspective. And so, we're targeting, let's call it roughly half a billion dollars in that as well. And so -- but maybe to speak to the underlying business, we will continue to generate the operating earnings that you see roughly in the range of 15 to 18 in terms of a billion consistent with what you saw here in 2023.
Ghansham Panjabi: Fantastic. Thank you so much.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Daniel Fisher: Sure.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess, first off in North America, just wanted to understand what you're seeing as far as promotional activity and maybe you can just kind of reiterate or update your thoughts on how we kind of proceed through the first half and if there's any been any offset from the Bud Light loss and in other -- the other kind of brands that you're seeing or customers.
Daniel Fisher: Sure. I think speaking to -- I think your question leans a little bit into am I seeing any promotional activity? Is there anything different just in the domestic landscape here? I'd say what we're hearing from our customers and it's manifesting slightly, you don't see a lot of promotional activity in January. You do as we -- now the next two weeks as we lead in the Super Bowl is typically when you would see some traditional and we are seeing some of that. But I think writ large, what everyone of the large CPG customers is acknowledging is that they're going to have to fight for top line this year. And that should benefit. It should benefit us. That should benefit the industry. We're seeing some inflections of growth, as I mentioned in the four week and the one week that look different than I think the last 18 to 24 months. So that's all positive. And then relative to kind of filling the Bud Light hole, if you will. Yes, there's some incremental volume that's helping to net impact that. But for us, we do a lot of that product and they have a vertical. And so, we're exposed to that brand. The things that were exposed to elsewhere are much smaller. They're growing. They're filling in some of the hole, but it's not -- it's not material, I would say it's incrementally better, not materially better. It's still the best thing is going to be other products from that particular brewer to grow. And so, I think that with a combination of you are seeing that brand kind of bottom out and starting to increment up. So, all of those things we anticipated it looking like this probably for the last six to nine months. And we've indicated that. There's nothing meaningful different from a guidance standpoint that I could really share at this point. We may see a little bit more now that we're heading into Super Bowl and some more traditional promotional activities. But I don't think you completely close the gap on this until we see other brands, other products kind of close that gap for us here as we lap the April sunsetting of that marketing issue.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And then if I could just ask about one more follow up.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah, sure.
Arun Viswanathan: It's on the portfolio, or at least the footprint. Do you think there's more actions that are coming as far as supply/demand and maybe your own capacity footprint, maybe by region, is there a need to maybe adjust some of your footprint in Europe or North America? I know you're not going ahead with Las Vegas, but what are some of your thoughts and maybe just kind of loop in. If you've seen any -- or if you're expecting to kind of announce like a larger scale cost reduction program within North America, or if you're kind of satisfied with where you are. Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think within North America, we're satisfied. I think we're seeing other industry participants kind of model our behavior. What we've done just at a high level, and I appreciate the question is we've really retired candidly older, less efficient assets that we're going to require a lot more maintenance CapEx to get them up to where we need to be to perform in the marketplace. So we've got, if you will, a more fit for purpose structure in North America. And as you see volumes inflect, we won't need cost out what we just need to do is continue to run these facilities as we are continue to ramp up the learning curve. Some of these are still new with new lines. And all of that will lend itself to a more productive and a higher profitable leverage fall through as we see the ramp up. Europe, I think we think we've got -- we've got to continue to look at Europe. I think we've got to continue to look at South America just be cognizant of the fact that there's a lot going on in those regions. There's a couple conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. So all of that will certainly play a role. Inflationary pressures, whether or not the regasification takes place in the mirror in which we think in Europe. So, a lot going into those conversations and decisions, but I think our footprints really solid to deliver on the plans that we've built here, pretty modest growth for this year. And just trying to take advantage of all the actions that we've laid in place and continue to see plants perform and more productivity to be generated as volumes inflect.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks a lot.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning everybody. Thanks for the details.
Daniel Fisher: Morning.
George Staphos: Hey, Dan -- good morning. So, first question I had. Thanks for the rundown on what you're expecting. I know you're focused on Ball Corporation obviously, but what do you think the market, particularly North America will grow at this year if you had a sense? Should we assume kind of the -- what your normal growth would be two to four, or do you think it's a little bit less than that or more than that.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I do think it'll be in that two to four range. I don't -- there's been some contractual shifts a little bit that's been well documented. So, us being flat means that we've rebalanced our portfolio. I think some others may be growing a bit. So yeah, I'd say low end is the 2%. Let's see what happens in peak season, but we're off to a much more normalized pricing behavior by our customers which is really -- we've talked about, this we need to see that in order to feel some level of confidence in the underlying volumes, and they need volume. So, I'm feeling good. It's in that longer term range with the possibility to inflect into 2025. There's a number of conversations in and around some substrate shift. That's back in the ether in a manner in which it hasn't been for the last couple years, so you might exit the year with a slightly better run rate, but I think that two to three, two to four is a pretty good range industry-wide.
George Staphos: Okay. No, I appreciate that Dan. And one question I had in terms of impact. It's having other positive or negative for you in terms of your operations and demand. There's been some discussion in the trade about some of the beverage companies having their operational issues to plan around which may have led or may lead to disruptions? Will that be a help ultimately for you to that impact fourth quarter at all? Just trying to peer there to extent that we can. And then my last question, I'll turn it over. When you talk about carbon footprint, what we've seen is, and we've talked about this in the past, the plastic guys beginning to push on carbon footprint. What's your one to punch in terms of why you think aluminum is better on that metric versus plastics when we look about carbon footprint through the supply chain? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think from a balance sheet standpoint, our current spec depending on what region you're in it could be better and could be worse just for full disclosure. I think our plans and the investments that you're starting to see and rolling capacity coming online that's not fully online that continues to be invested in. And a number of those, it's 85% recycled content that's been guaranteed on the sheet, it's green energy and the backdrop of what's going to be fueling those facilities. So a lot of that's happening and a lot of that's happening around the world. We're already, for example, in Brazil, much better than any other substrate in terms of the carbon footprint there. And so a lot of the -- a lot of the supply chain, a lot of the investments and a lot of that industrial complex and around aluminum will reflect getting to where Brazil is. On top of that, there are technologies that are being introduced on the virgin aluminum side that are quite encouraging. And we actually just introduced 10% virgin aluminum on our cup with 90% recycled content that's very close to carbon neutral, because the virgin aluminum now, there's a couple of aluminum companies that have developed carbon free smelting operations and technologies. Those will continue to be invested in, a number of companies will do that. And so as you start to progress toward 2030 really being the goal, whereby people are going to have to put up or shut up. I like the trajectory of flight for aluminum right now much more than I did even two years ago to be quite honest with you. So, I think the investments are showing up. This -- the supply chain are committed in a lockstep in a number of associations to get to some of these aspirational targets. And there are offtake agreements and investments happening to ensure that that happens. So, this is no longer a theoretical argument for us. We have real plans to get there. And I'm confident we'll get there in a shorter period of time than anybody else. But we have to continue to see that investment and continue to step into that. So that's the truth. And we're headed and it's going to become more and more transparent and we're working with our customers to get there. They need this as well with some of the SEC reporting that's being talked about in 2027 and obviously the European reporting requirements that show up in 2026. So, we're kind of sprinting after this carbon neutrality in a way that everybody's kind of got to put up or shut up. And I think we're in a good spot to deliver.
George Staphos: Thanks Dan. And just on customer disruptions and what it might mean for you.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. We have the ability now with our -- we're talking specifically in North America, we have the ability. We've got a little slack capacity. We're running our plants much better than we were over the last two to three years. And so, I think we're going to be able to react better. We have much better dialogue, much better supply plans, much better S&OP process. We were all forced to dust those off over a COVID and the supply chain [technical difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by your conference will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by your conference will resume momentarily. Your conference may now resume.
Daniel Fisher: Okay. Thank you. Sorry about that. We lost connection there for a second. I think in response to the last question, I think we're in a good spot to react to volume surges, if you will, just because of how we're operating in North America, the slack capacity we have in the conversations and the S&OP process that's been established and currently being refined and improved upon each and every day. So, feel good about our ability to react to that.
George Staphos: Thanks Dan. That's great.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: First question just on North America. I think for the full year, your volumes were down about 7%, but your operating EBIT was up about 11%, which suggests your unit economics got quite a bit better this year. So, if we do return to say a 1%, 2% volume type environment, I guess what sort of incremental margin should we expect on actual volume growth here in the business?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Keep in mind just as a reference point. This year had a bit of catch up in terms of PPI economics. And so if you -- I think a go forward position more in line with our historical, if we get a percent of growth, we should get 2X in terms of earnings inflection. There's a chance to do a bit better because our footprint is in a better spot. It's more cost effective. But I would think in that 2X the volume unit growth in terms of earnings flow through and maybe a smidge more for the next coming years, depending on mix and channel and category and customer.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. And then second, just for Howard, I think you mentioned, if I heard correctly about $500 million for AR factoring unwind in 2024. I guess how much cost savings would you expect from that action? And where is that cost currently showing up in your P&L today?
Howard Yu: Yeah. So, I mean, basically we use the current spot interest rate associated with the savings. So, if you take $0.5 billion, let's call it roughly 4% of that. And so, as it relates to the savings, we would see it come through in operating at the operating level in the SG&A line. And so that's typically where we would see -- the savings associated with that.
Daniel Fisher: And the two regions specifically building on that is where the higher cost programs are in South America and in North America, but South America even the current spot market interest rates.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Howard Yu: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Edlain Rodriguez: Just a quick follow-up on the capacity closure question. I mean, yes, you have rationalized your footprint. Like, do you think the industry as a whole is where it needs to be? Like, do other industry players need to close some capacity? Or is the market balanced now given the expected recovery in volume?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think the industry writ large in North America, I think is specifically your question is in a good spot, and keep in mind we're probably holding on to the majority of the excess capacity given the beer brand. So, we're managing that. We're managing that on a cash basis. That'll inflect over a period of time. But I think the industry -- again, if we're growing -- if the industry is growing at 2% to 4%, I think this is a good equilibrium to operate from in terms of asset utilization and supply demand balance.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. And just one quick one on Argentina. We might not say again, like, what's the exposure there? Like, how much is Argentina's percentage of sales for the company? And do you expect people to be drinking less beer because of the currency devaluation? Or like -- what are you expecting there?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. So, the volume comment, there's a joke in here. I would expect them to be drinking more. But in all honesty, what we're seeing is -- the beer space is quite resilient and can growth and aluminum packaging growth versus glass has been very positive over the last handful of years. Let's see how folks get on there. But we're looking at Argentina being essentially flattish, maybe a tick better year-over-year 2022 to 20 -- excuse me -- 2023 to 2024. And inflecting in the back half of the year, probably in terms of volume and into 2025. But they continue to drink beer and they continue to drink beer out of cans and I just don't see a tremendous amount of growth or we shouldn't be counting on tremendous amount of growth versus last year until things start to settle down a bit more there. I'll let…
Howard Yu: Yeah. I think maybe just to go ahead and characterize the size of business for us. It's roughly about a 1% of our operating earnings in 2023 and represents about 2% of our volume. And so, clearly, despite seeing 2023 negative volumes there in Argentina in the region, we still drove to 2%-plus growth driven by the strength of Brazil. So, hopefully that helps characterize a little bit about the size of that business.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. You guys have been cutting on and off and I think Howard, when you gave your outlook, part of that was cut off. So, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So you're guiding to $500 million of free cash flow for 2024, but from a normalized basis, that would probably look a lot better. Did you say Howard, it was like a $500 million headwind from factoring reversing and there's some impact on the tax for aerospace? Can you kind of flush that out? Just make sure we understand what the true free cash flow of power of this business would look like.
Howard Yu: Sure. So, you're right, Phil. I think that is correct that in 2024 we do anticipate about $0.5 billion of factoring. What that will do is essentially add back in working capital. So it's out -- it's a use of cash in that regard. And then of the $5.6 billion total proceeds associated with the aerospace, we anticipate about $1 billion of that as a tax payment. And that also flows through operating, right? And so even though the inflow comes via investing, the outflow goes out of operating. And so I think those are a couple of the nuances associated with the year. Maybe if I just try to bridge for you guys from a 2023 standpoint, our operating cash flow in 2023 was about $1.8 billion, maybe a little north of that. Less the working capital in 2023, that's about $300 million and let's call it $360 million. That gets us to a jump off point, a base of 2024 of about $1.5 billion. And then if you go ahead and take out the tax payment, that gets us to about the $500 million in free cash flow that I referenced.
Phil Ng: Okay. That's helpful. And then on Europe, can you guys provide a little more color? The quarter is definitely a little softer from a volumes perspective. Profitability still look quite strong. How are things kind of shaping up to start the year? I think, Dan, you were kind of pointing to maybe that business inflecting positively from a volume standpoint, maybe sometime in 2Q, but just kind of give us a little more color on how things are progressing in Europe and what you're seeing there.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Phil, I think you're right. I think South America and North America ended the year inflecting favorably in terms of volume versus sort of our anticipation in Europe was softer. We started to see that at the third quarter call and signaled that, but it was even a bit softer than that. Places that we operate in that also contributed to that. I think Egypt and Turkey weren't helpful in terms of volumes in the fourth quarter. So that was a bit of what you're seeing in terms of a drag. Where we started the year, again, it's four weeks. We're a little bit better than what we thought. And we thought we'd be kind of flattish to down in the first quarter year-over-year for Europe. Right now, through the first four weeks, it's actually a little better. We thought that heading into peak season in the second half of next year, inflation would moderate in Europe and consumers would do a little better. I think you've seen a lot of retailers get pretty aggressive with CPG companies in terms of what prices they're showing on the shelves. And I think that is that -- all of those conditions should move favorably toward volume for us. So, hopefully that gives you some indication. We're still looking for modest growth for Europe inflecting sequentially in the quarters in the back half of the year. And we might be able to do just a smidge better here in the first quarter if all of these things continue to manifest in the way they are right now that we're seeing.
Phil Ng: Okay. Appreciate the color.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Daniel Fisher: Hi, Adam.
Adam Samuelson: Hi. So, I guess, maybe just going back to South America and I know Argentina had issues in the fourth quarter. Volumes in the segment were up 2%, profit was up 60%. And I'm just trying to make sure with FX and hyperinflation and the Argentine impact, I'm understanding kind of the magnitude of that profit growth in South America as we think about what that business will do or can do into the future if you don't have some of those disruptive impacts by the end of next year.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I mean, Adam, I do think that we have quite a bit going on in Argentina. You saw the volume sawing off. I think as we think about the business and as we do various scenario planning, we continue to contemplate how things are looking with the fiscal policies and the like. But if you've looked at that business historically, it has been one of our best performing regions. And we continue to monitor obviously and derisk where we're possible. But as of today, our belief is that that market and we want to make sure that -- we support the customers there and our view on that business being intact long-term remain.
Howard Yu: Yeah. I would add just a couple of comments. Obviously, when you're in more volatile emerging markets, quote unquote countries, you get paid really well to be there. So, when that volume is off, your margins will dissipate just from a country mix standpoint. That's the environment we're in probably versus where you saw us a couple years ago and specific to Argentina. So that volume matters. And as that comes back, we'll inflect up and we'll leverage up and you should see that improvement. Brazil has been very resilient here. The second half, we saw that inflect. We continue to see a strong January and our folks are calling for a decent and improved Q1. And that will help. Things that matter in Brazil then are going to show up in terms of product mix. The way we -- the way we sell our can and ends to our major customers have pretty big tax swings and impacts there. So that will matter. But in terms of the full year, quarter-to-quarter, maybe a little choppy, but the full year will continue to deflect, see a more profitable business there and see mid to single digit growth. Chile is off to a decent start. Paraguay is off to a decent start. So, I'm feeling good about South America. Argentina is meaningful for us though in terms of the question that you posed. So, we just have to -- we're holding to kind of flattish earnings year-over-year. And so, as we get growth from other areas, the margins won't look, I think on a mixed basis as good, but the earnings will flow through consistent with those regions and what those customers have delivered historically.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. Now that's really helpful. And then if I just ask a follow-up on the other kind of non-reportable businesses, the aerosol and the cups business. Aerosol business had a good fourth quarter. How do we think about that line item offsetting corporate moving into 2024?
Howard Yu: Yeah. We saw a -- I think we saw a year-over-year 40% improvement in operating earnings for the aerosol business. We're going to see double-digit growth in earnings next year. The team has done a phenomenal job turning that business around and it's inflecting the growth and a lot of that has to do with this reuse category that's emerging in places like Europe on the personal care spot, even the beverage spot side that we're taking advantage of and very disciplined contract management in terms of inflation and things of that nature. So that business will have doubled in earnings over about a 36-month period. We continue to see nice growth there. Cups will be incrementally better. We've seen foodservice grow. Retail has come off. It was a difficult retail year, but we should see continued tail -- tailwind in terms food is really the big opportunity set for cups, but negligible margin improvement, maybe taken the terms of 5 million to 10 million better year-over-year there.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. That's all really helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Roxland: Thanks, Dan, Howard and management [ph] for taking my questions.
Daniel Fisher: Sure.
Mike Roxland: A lot of ground cover today. And just wanted to follow up quickly on the business development efforts you're pursuing. You called it out in the press release. Any reason why you felt the need to call it out? Is this something that you've recently accelerated?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. We are making a more conscious effort to push innovation and it's being received. It's a catch 2022, right? Somebody has to be asking for it as well. And we're seeing more of that. I think I made reference to this in the last earnings call as well. It's going to take innovation and it's going to take differentiation for our customers. It's not just going to be pricing as they move forward. And so, in order to grow, they're going to have to get back to what they've historically done. New product launches, new brand launches, new innovations, all of that's going to matter. And that is something that we do really well. And so, we're stepping into those opportunities and that's why we called it out. And I suspect over the back half of this year and in 2025, you'll start to see some things show up on shelves that we're encouraged about. I'll leave it there.
Mike Roxland: Got it. And does that require any headcount?
Daniel Fisher: No. It doesn't require headcount. I think we have -- what we need. You've always got to look at your business and identify whether you have the right skill mix, whether you're right -- and I think those are the things that we're doing. And candidly, we'll talk about this more at Investor Day in June, but we're on the verge of being exclusively an aluminum packaging company. And we have a couple advantages, right? We are great at innovation, and we can sell sustainability at scale. And those two things need appropriate resources behind them. But that does not mean we're adding cost. In fact, we should be able to do this in a much more efficient manner than we have historically.
Mike Roxland: Got it. And one quick follow-up, Dan. Just in terms of the retailers resetting shelf space, any early signs of how that's going to play out and when you can start -- maybe using some of that underutilized capacity that you have?
Daniel Fisher: We're definitely growing with folks that are taking shelf space and share. It is inflecting in a couple of plants directly located to those customers. I wouldn't say it's meaningful across the system and it will continue to grow. But you really won't see those shelf space impacts until peak season. That's where it really manifests. And so, Q2 and Q3 will be something that could kind of alter hopefully positively our outlook as we're giving it today.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Thanks very much and good luck in 2024.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Gabe Hajde: Dan, Howard, good morning.
Daniel Fisher: Hi, Gabe.
Howard Yu: Hi, Gabe.
Gabe Hajde: Somewhat of a fact check here, Dan. You mentioned growth would have been flattish, I guess on the volume side, had it not been for the brand disruption. Is that directionally then about 3 billion units that we should be thinking about?
Daniel Fisher: That's exactly it. I mean 3 billion and somewhere in that $8,200 million impact.
Gabe Hajde: Okay. Thank you for that. And then I feel like we've hit each segment sort of in different answers to questions. But I think I heard you in response to two questions ago. Segment earnings in South America, flattish on the full year, despite the mid single digit earnings growth -- or excuse me -- volume growth that you're talking about. And then in Bev, I guess North Central America, we have a $30 million bad guy from the energy contract. Let's call it 10 to 15 of a good guy for the unwinding of AR factoring, depending on timing. And then flattish volume growth. You mentioned the PPI should be positive. And I think there's a mid-year reset on your prior, I don't know, $180 million or so that was contracted. So, maybe a little bit more prescriptive there. And then low single digit growth in Europe translating into some operating earnings improvement at the segment level in Europe.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold. Your conference will resume momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold. Your conference will resume momentarily. Thank you. You may resume your conference. Gabe, please repeat your question.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Gabe, I think I've got it, sorry.
Gabe Hajde: No, I don't think anyone else wants to hear from you.
Daniel Fisher: Let me start with South America. No, we should see an inflection in earnings year-over-year. Some of the factoring that we're retiring will help contribute to that. And we will see earnings growth off of the volume growth. And so, it will more or less mirror 2X the volume growth. It may come in a different form via AR factoring retirement and some interest expense being retired within our SG&A bucket. But it will -- if we grow 5%, we should grow close to 10% earnings in that range. We'll have mixed that a lot of said it country to country, but we have mechanisms to -- continue to inflect profitably on that growth, which we're encouraged by. And then your other question, I said the bridge, let me help you with some bridge items in North America. I think there's one piece that you didn't cover, which is in the first quarter. And Howard made this in his opening comments. The VP Fp&A [ph], you got $30 million. There's a like amount associated with the brand disruption. So, the unit volume we sold and the absorption we got from that brand that had the marketing issue in April is a like amount. So it's closer to $60 million in the first quarter in North America. You will get the PPI benefits and the other things I think the way you laid out, it was in a very constructive manner. And we're not anticipating anything inflecting mid-year. Right now, I think if PPI -- excuse me -- if inflation continues to be in a moderated position, it won't be a plus or minus like we've been talking about here the last two and a half, three years. I think it'll be more or less, we can offset whatever inflationary pickup via productivity gains. So, it won't be a bridge item, but you're right. We have to carry-in for the first six months. You've identified it correctly in terms of the quarter capture on the numbers. But the only thing that I would call out is the additional $30 million disruption probably from the brand issue in Q1.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you for that, Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much.
Daniel Fisher: Sure, Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: It's been reported in the press that Carrefour, the French retailer, is pushing back against Pepsi because Pepsi wanted to increase prices, I don't know, 7% for 2024. And so what Carrefour is doing is moving away from Pepsi products across the board. When you see something like that, do you think that the consumer products companies may be following different strategies and different geographies? And do you see that as a sign that there's still an emphasis on increasing prices by the consumer products companies for next year?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Good question. So, it's not just Carrefour. It's all throughout Europe. Europe is much more regulated on price increases. So by virtue of that, what you can do in North America and what you can do in Europe are vastly different. But what is happening is the retailers are moving very aggressive against brands that are contemplating price increases in Europe. And that disruption is a positive thing for us. In North America, it's also happening not as publicly. But I do think in North America, the brands have much more power in terms of their ability to price. And that's something that they're able to leverage, but they still have to have volume growth, and volume declined in the fourth quarter for a lot of those major brands at the end of the -- in Q3 in a manner in which everyone's going to have to take a different and a more historical approach to pricing. Volume is going to have to show up. And I think that's what the reaction has been in Europe in a really pronounced way because their inflationary pressures because the energy concerns have been much more present. And I think that's something that is regulated and it's also something where end consumers have really fallen off in terms of volume purchases in the fourth quarter.  So hopefully that helps. But yes, different behavioral patterns in North America and Europe. It's always been that way. But I do think the aggressive nature of the retail sentiment now in Europe probably lends itself to a better outlook for us in terms of volume.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: So would that mean that your better outcome for volume in Europe is more of a 2025 event rather than a 2024 event?
Daniel Fisher: No, I think what we're pointing to -- so this is something that we were seeing in the fourth quarter. It's newsworthy now, but this is not something that would alter, I think, our outlook quite yet. I think what's more important is like the regasification and the inflationary pressures that folks are experiencing in the end consumer across Europe. That will be more important than I think this retail issue of 5% price versus 7%, 3%, something along that nature. So, we do believe that there'll be sequential volume improvement in Europe and it will inflect to kind of a low to mid single digit number kind of in that 3%-ish range for growth in Europe in our business. And that'll be stronger toward the back end of the year. And then to your point, yes, 2025 will be stronger even more.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you. And Christina, we'll take one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Fisher, we actually have no further questions at this time.
End of Q&A:
Daniel Fisher: Okay. Thanks everybody. And we'll hopefully see most of you at the Investor Day here in June. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, November 2, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Mr. Dan Fisher. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Frank. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2023 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. Historical financial results for the divested Russian operations are reflected in the beverage packaging EMEA segment. See Note-1, business segment information. For a quarterly breakout of Russia's historical sales and comparable operating earnings. In addition, the release includes a summary of noncomparable items as well as a reconciliation of comparable net earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Before we dive into our discussion about Ball's solid third quarter earnings and cash flow performance, I would like to reference some important announcements made recently by the company. On August 17, the company announced an agreement to sell its Aerospace business to BAE Systems, Inc. for $5.6 billion in cash proceeds, achieving a premium multiple for a premium business. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and adjustments. Therefore, prospective estimates for certain financial metrics provided in today's earnings release and conference call commentary exclude any potential impact of the Aerospace business sale. The process to achieve necessary regulatory approvals is underway and when appropriate, a progress announcement will be made. Also, in early September, the company announced Scott Morrison's well-deserved retirement as Ball's CFO; and then Howard Yu has assumed the role of EVP and CFO. To ensure a smooth transition and to enable a successful close to the aerospace transaction, Scott has agreed to stay on with Ball as an adviser until September of 2024. It is a pleasure to have both Scott and Howard joining me on the call today. I'll provide some brief introductory remarks and provide Howard an opportunity to introduce himself. Scott will execute his last earnings call for Ball and discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with closing comments and our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and Q&A. First, let me begin by taking a few minutes to thank Scott for his 23 years of service to Ball and his 13 years of serving as Ball's CFO. Some of you may not know that Scott has been an integral part of every Ball M&A deal since 1998. Pre-Ball, he was actually one of our outside bankers arranging the financing for the Reynolds Metals acquisition. In 2000, Scott joined Ball as our Treasurer and the rest is history. He has executed multiple transformative M&A and record-setting bond deals, successfully navigated ball through numerous economic cycles, always stepped up when called upon and he's completed 55 of these wonderful earnings calls now. Scott is sailing off into the sunset, literally. Our company is better because of Scott Morrison and personally I am thankful to have worked with him since 2010. At my request, Scott agreed to stay on a bit longer as CFO than he originally planned. And I'm so grateful he did. Nothing like a multiyear global pandemic land wars, the steepest rise in interest rates and inflation since the '70s and helping onboard a new CEO to finish off your incredibly successful career. Scott, thank you for your commitment to Ball, for being a friend, a trusted year, for being a candid mentor, a leader who surrounded himself with a capable team and someone who bled Ball blue. On behalf of the entire team, we wish you a long, happy and healthy retirement. I'm excited to introduce Howard Yu. Paul welcomed Howard as our new CFO in late September. Howard joins Ball with a wealth of experience as a public company CFO, and a CV packed with global experience and fresh eyes to unlock even more value for our stakeholders. Howard's focus on continuous improvement and passion for operational excellence will help lead all for the next decade. Howard, I'll turn it over to you to say a few words.
Howard Yu: Thank you, Dan, and the entire Ball team for your warm welcome. Scott, congratulations on your retirement, and I really appreciate your insights and introductions during the first 30 day. My onboarding and immersion have been excellent, meeting with leaders across three continents, participating in the recent Board meetings and touring several manufacturing facilities. I look forward to meeting many of you in person at future investor events and industry conferences. We have a packed investor relations schedule to close out 2023, including a reception at the New York Stock Exchange on November 14. Reach out to Ann and the Investor Relations team for details about our upcoming outreach schedule. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Howard. Our team delivered strong third quarter results, improved operational efficiencies, inflationary cost recovery, the benefits of cost-out actions and a lower effective tax rate offset the impact of tough year-over-year volume comparisons. $43 million of higher interest expense and a $14 million operating earnings headwind from the Russian sale. I'm proud to say that our team did an excellent job of managing both costs working capital and isolated volatility across supply chain partners in our packaging and aerospace businesses during the quarter. Our overweight positions to the ongoing mass beer brand demand disruption in the U.S. and past regional customer mix decisions are evident in Ball's volume performance. Double-digit volume growth in Brazil and better than industry volume performance in EMEA helped to offset some of the North American headwind resulting in our global shipments being down 3% in the third quarter, a sequential improvement versus second quarter 2023, which was down 5%. Moving forward, our actions to tighten supply demand domestically, lower costs, improve operational efficiencies, leverage the sustainability attributes of our innovative aluminum packaging portfolio and our ability to lean into our well-capitalized low-cost plant assets will position Ball to win commercially and improve returns on invested capital. In addition, our actions to unlock value via the announced sale of our Aerospace business and utilize net proceeds to rapidly leverage in the range of three times, strengthen the balance sheet and return substantial value to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends will provide financial flexibility and drive value creation now and in the years to come. I would also like to extend my gratitude to our employees for working with the utmost level of respect, care and concern for one another while adapting to the recent company decision to sell Aerospace and further reduce fixed costs across our plant network. We're beginning to see some sequential improvement in our global beverage shipments, particularly in Brazil, as we head into their busy summer selling season. Given the current in-consumer demand trends in North America and EMEA, we will continue to run the business for cash and with an eye on reducing fixed costs and being fit for the future in the current macroeconomic environment. In our Aerospace and Aluminum Aerosol Businesses, demand for our products and technologies continues to grow. In Aerospace, our backlog and one not booked backlog both increased. And in our Global Aluminum Aerosol Business, third quarter shipments increased 10.4%. Our growing extruded aluminum business continues to serve new categories and offer reuse refill bottle innovations to a broader set of customers and occasions, emphasizing aluminum over other substrates. Very late in the quarter and as mentioned in the press release, Ball experienced a fire at its Verona, Virginia aluminum slug manufacturing facility, which is part of our extruded aluminum aerosol business. We are thankful that all plant personnel were evacuated safely during the incident and that no injuries occurred while first responders extinguish the blaze. Unfortunately, the fire damaged 95% of the plant's equipment and the structure is a complete loss. The extruded aluminum team continues to support the well-being of our colleagues and it's also working very hard to try to meet our customers' demand from our remaining global aluminum slug facilities. Insurance coverage will handle the majority of the financial impact. However, we have determined that going forward, we will be unable to operate at the current site. Employees and key stakeholders were notified of this decision yesterday evening. Consistent with our prior commentary, we remain positioned to deliver on our cash flow, deleveraging and return of value to shareholder goals. Based on our current expectations for end consumer demand trends in EMEA and North America, and other activities and items referenced on today's call, we anticipate growing comparable diluted EPS low to mid-single digits in 2023 and look forward to discussing our growth targets for 2024 on our February earnings call. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers stakeholders and everyone listening today. With that, for the last time, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Third quarter 2023 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus $0.75 in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter sales decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, lower volumes in the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022, offset by the pass-through of inflationary costs and currency translation. In the third quarter, comparable net earnings increased compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the contractual pass-through of inflationary costs, a lower tax rate, fixed cost savings and benefits of prior year SG&A cost-out initiatives, offsetting notably higher interest expense, the headwind from the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022 and lower volumes. To reiterate our prior earnings call commentary, we have proactively managed supply demand across our system of plants and significantly reduced raw and finished goods inventory. Including our most recent actions to close Kent, permanently ceased plans to build North Las Vegas and defer the Concord facility into 2028. North America supply-demand has tightened up significantly, and we are lowering costs across our well-capitalized plant network. As a result, we are positioned to improve returns on invested capital, deliver our customers' pack size and reclosability innovation at scale across a national footprint. And in future years, when end customer demand inflects more favorably utilize the operational efficiencies we are achieving now to serve our customers' future growth without spending significant growth capital. In EMEA, the business has successfully lapped its last quarter of Russian business sale headwinds and is on track in 2023 to fill the $86 million of comparable operating earnings hole from the business sale. The team continues to operate at a high level as they navigate varying consumer and demand conditions, particularly in the U.K. In South America, our volumes increased 14.1% in the quarter as we teed up on our prior earnings call, regional product mix and the volatility in Argentina weighed on segment earnings during the quarter. The busy fourth quarter summer selling season is underway and segment earnings are anticipated to inflect very favorably in the fourth quarter. As we sit here today, some very consistent commentary and key metrics, we ended third quarter in a very solid liquidity position with approximately $3 billion in cash and committed credit facilities. Cash on hand will be used to address the mid-November bond maturity. 2023 CapEx will be in the range of $1.2 billion, driven by cash outflows related to prior year's projects. 2024 CapEx is targeted to be much lower than and in the range of GAAP DNA levels. We anticipate generating free cash flow of approximately $750 million in 2023 and our 2023 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 17% to 18%. For clarity, it's important to note that an R&D tax credit benefited our third quarter ETR, so modeling the fourth quarter ETR in the low 20% range is appropriate. Full year 2023 interest expense is expected to be a touch higher than what we said last quarter in the range of $460 million. Full year 2023 corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable will be in the range of $75 million we had previously said $80 million. And taking into account demand trends experienced so far in the fourth quarter, fourth quarter comparable operating earnings are on track to be consistent with third quarter results. We continue to expect year-end 2023 net debt to comparable EBITDA to trend in the range of 3.7 times. And following the receipt of net proceeds from the Aerospace sale, we intend to drive leverage in the range of three times. Last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend. And as Dan mentioned, reducing leverage and getting back to share repurchases are top of mind. As I wrap up my comments, I want to express what a privilege it has been to be part of Ball for so long. Thank you again for all your banter on the 55 earnings calls I've shared with Dave, Ray, John and Dan over the years. I'm pretty sure you won't miss me, and it's great to be leaving the company and you with in great hands of Dan, Howard and the team. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Scott. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken in 2023 and will continue to execute in 2024 and beyond will improve earnings, generate cash flow enable low-carbon best value innovative aluminum packaging offerings on a global scale and will expand shareholder value creation for many years to come. Thank you to everyone listening today. And with that, Frank, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Staphos: Thanks, hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. Scott and Howard, congratulations on the next chapters and Scott, really on behalf of, frankly, all the analysts and the investors on these calls over the last number of years, I just want to thank you for all the support you've given everyone's research and trying to understand the industry and understand Ball, so thank you.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, George.
George Staphos: It's been a pleasure. I want to get to the capacity closures and how it might impact your prior comments on the fact that you had a couple of years of capacity, maybe I'm paraphrasing a little bit there, but I don't think too much to grow into at the time that you made those comments. So in a couple of years - or let me say it differently, do you still have a couple of years of capacity to grow into even after these closures, is the market now tighter, and so you have less than a couple of years to grow into? And if it's still the two then have any of your longer-term growth rate expectations by region change at all? And if so, any color there would be helpful.
DanFisher: Yes, thanks. We have dry powder in North America, probably more so in North America, but it's not just the capacity shuttering and the capitalization. It's also the fact. And like I've mentioned this a couple of times publicly, George. But the number of folks from about 2017 to 2020, we had over 1,500 retirements within our North America labor force. So you're onboarding a bunch of new folks plus standing up new facilities, another 700 to 800 new employees and our efficiencies dipped 3%, 4%, 5% in some instances in terms of the efficiency curve between 2020 and 2021. So I've got the combination of folks getting up to speed, performing much better. You're seeing it in the results. So we're going to get productivity gains that won't require capital. And then obviously, the new facilities are all ramping up in line with our expectations, maybe a little ahead of that. The growth trajectory, then that you commented on, it's obviously slower in '23, and it will be a little slower in '24 than what we anticipated a couple of years ago. So I think the combination of those two, we feel really confident about not having to spend the capital in order to match the growth here for an extended period of time, maybe three to four years to put it in perspective. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're managing our capital outlays and allocations. There's always going to be opportunity to innovate and do some different things, but that's well within our GAAP DNA number. So we'll be able to grow. We'll be able to margin up on new innovative products, and we won't have to spend outside of DNA. And in some instances, in some periods, we might be able to spend below that for the next two to three years.
George Staphos: Dan, that's great. I had two other questions and I'll turn it over. One, Brazil turned very quickly for you, and that's good news. Can you talk a bit about what was driving that? Obviously, you're laying the tracks in the second quarter and prior. But if is there anything that you could add in terms of color how much you can continue that, what kind of earnings trajectory you think you will see in the fourth quarter, you talked about it inflecting? And then the release talked to some lighter weight returnable or reusable package, I believe, in the Aluminum Aerosol side, where you're using the technology there. Can you give us a bit more color on that, how you might use that within beverage and how it may affect your trajectory down the road? Thank you, and good luck on the quarter.
DanFisher: Thanks, George. Yes, so very much in line with what our previous commentary was in Brazil. Our major strategic partner certainly had a hedge position that was unhelpful in terms of the aluminum cost of their products in the marketplace, that rolled off. And that economy is just getting better. Interest rates are coming off, growth is better. They continue to uptick the GDP projections in that area. The inflationary pressures are coming off. We also saw a couple of percentage points of substrate shipped out of returnable glass into aluminum. So all of those things that we forecast have happened. I mean the good news is it's happening. So there's stability in that marketplace, which is inconsistent with what's happening, for instance, in Argentina, but Brazil is in a good spot. And we we're turning on at least one additional line to try to keep pace with demand in the fourth quarter, and that will extend, we believe, into the first quarter. So we're feeling good about basically every place in South America with the exception of what we - and what everybody understands what's going on in Argentina, we're feeling much better. So I would imagine that will continue. We will see a step-up in earnings, significant step-up in earnings is what we had in Q3. So that will be in line again with that second half hockey stick, which we've had a number of questions on that throughout the year, and it's playing out with the exception of Argentina right in line with what we thought at the beginning of the year. And then the reuse refill, I think the commentary in and around this, it's small, it's small volumes. These are bottles, they're refillable bottles, so think personal care space and think water. So there is an element here where we can do some things within the beverage platform to offer reuse, refill opportunities with our aerosol product line. And because of the weight and the construction and the rigidity of that package, it's just - it plays better in a reuse environment than the coil can design characteristics. So yes, we're bullish about that. Obviously, a lot of reuse conversations happen in Europe, and we want to make sure that we've got product offerings, and we're in the conversation because it's all white space for us. So certainly a nice opportunity step, but still off a very small base.
George Staphos: Dan, yes, no, could it help your single-use in water and other beverages down the road? Thank you, I'm sorry for the triple dip there.
DanFisher: No, thank you. Absolutely. So I think once you get the conversion, to the smaller sizes, and you're seeing it play out in Mountain towns and the anti-plastic sentiment on the beaches. You could step into the smaller product offerings with the reuse refill. You get the end consumer that understands the water tastes really good and the product is really good, and it's good for the environment. So I think there is a bridge here. But as I indicated, we're in the emphasis of this transition.
George Staphos: Thank you, very much.
DanFisher: Yep.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed.
Mike Leithead: Great, thank you. Good morning, Scott going forward and Howard, I look forward to working with you going forward. First question I wanted to ask, your North American, South American volumes were obviously much different than your two public competitors. And I appreciate looking at just one quarter isn't perfect. There's differences of customer and product category. But just in both regions, can you help us better understand if it's all really attributable to product and customer mix? Or are there underlying market share shifts with customers going on in each region?
DanFisher: Yes, thank you for that. Let's start with South America. South America is actually a much easier market. There is - if you're looking at it quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see swings and it is 100% a result of who's partnered with who. Big volumes from very few players and in the case of us, our strategic Partner One in the marketplace in Q3. So we have a big position with them. They won in the market, our volumes look better. In North America, it's less about share shift in terms of contract movement, and it's more our exposure to mass beer. I mean, that's it in a nutshell. And we had a very strong Q3 last year whereas some of our competitors had a very weak Q3. Destocking, inventory movement started about the third quarter last year and some of us have had impacts from that point until now. And when you look at year-over-year comps, it can be a bit noisy. All of that is, I think, normalizing. So as you're moving forward in Q4 and beyond, what you're going to see, I think, across the industry, writ large, is customer mix and in alignment with scanner data. I think it will be a much more transparent way to look at the marketplace and volumes for that matter.
Mike Leithead: Great. That was super helpful. And then just on the Aerospace sale, I know you touched on it briefly. Could you just update us where the regulatory approvals currently stand? And just maybe what your latest assumption is on when you think that deal should close?
DanFisher: Yes, I can't give too much detail, but I would characterize it as constructive where we're at with our discussions. And we signaled first half '24 closure. We still believe that is well within executing boundaries. We referenced that number based on the most recent transaction that we took about seven to eight months. So we're hopeful that we don't have as much overlap as that deal did and it will be a more efficient process. But I think the guidance of first half '24 is the appropriate one at this stage.
Mike Leithead: Great, thank you.
DanFisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: I just want to echo my congrats to you, Scott, and Howard as well. Best wishes to you both for the future.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, thanks Scott. Dan, going back to what we witnessed over the last couple of years, right? So quite a bit has been done in terms of permanent capacity reduction at your end in North America between last year and this year. And I'm just trying to reconcile, is that a function of just a lot's been done. Capacity has been - your footprint has been modernized to some extent. The market has recalled for different reasons and so on and so forth. And are you just anticipating that the market sort of resets for a while before we start the reacceleration and to sort of support that reacceleration, you'll be doing a lot in between with productivity to match up against that to support that growth eventually. Is that the right way to think about it?
DanFisher: We'll absolutely - there'll be a more stable operating environment from a volume perspective. So maybe I'll give you a little bit of color and a little bit more color on how we're thinking about it. So - and we signaled this, as you know, Ghansham, we're like, listen, there's not going to be any different pricing behavior until we get to Q4 because there's great tailwinds from our customers on inflection, on earnings and top line revenue. It gets tougher now in Q4 for everybody. And then you also saw private label begin to take share. Those are the things we needed to see to construct a different pricing behavior. And so, I think we're going to return to prior to COVID in terms of methodical pricing in and around CPI for our customers. In that environment, we're going to make more money and flow more cash. So then the other question is, tell me about top line. So top line for me is 100% about the depth with which the promotions are going to happen against a weaker end consumer. And so that is something that is a question mark in terms of what the actual volume increases are. But what's not a question is exactly to your point, we're going to run our business better, more productive, focus on operational excellence, be more agile, take the working capital out, flow more cash and buy back shares. That's what we're going to be doing until you see a little bit more of an inflection in top line. And then we'll be then we'll be levering up really, really nicely off this more efficient cost structure that we've got in place.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then for my second question, just in terms of Europe, I think this was the first negative volume quarter since the second quarter of 2020, if I looked at the model correctly.
DanFisher: Correct.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, what's happening, I think you called out the U.K. maybe just jog us through the different subregions of Europe.
DanFisher: Yes, we actually won in the market even on those lower volumes. Can continues to win even on the lower volumes. There was a bit in the quarter on cooler, rainier across Central Europe and the U.K. in particular. But this is a function of a weaker end consumer fundamentally. And we'll be living with that here into the first half of '24. We still see growth, but the combination of all those impacts, I think we’re it large across Europe. Energy costs are higher that's embedded in our P&L and our competitors' P&L. So weaker in consumer here for a period of time is the main driver for volumes coming off a bit.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first question is just on the footprint. And would you think that after all of these industry moves, including your own, I think you've noted that the industry will continue to grow at a low rate. Would you think that at some point, just given the low barriers to entry that there could be some new entrants as well and potentially some further capacity additions, I mean, we are seeing some strength in ready-to-drink in some other categories? Or is it still absorbing capacity, I guess?
DanFisher: Yes, I don't foresee new entrants three or four of them that have entered are not having any fun right now, and I don't know that they will candidly be around much longer. So, it will be a handful of players that absorb the growth moving forward and we'll be one of them. The volume that's reflected currently is not necessarily the volume that's being won and will show up here over the next couple of years. So we feel really good about the footprint we have today, how we'll be able to optimize that and how we'll be able to make more money off of that footprint moving forward. I would also challenge the low barrier of entry, canned plants cost about $300 million to spend. And when interest rates are in the 6s and 7s, it's not a fertile ground for folks jumping in.
Arun Viswanathan: Sure, and then - thanks for that. And then I guess just - I also wanted to just get your thoughts on post the Aerospace sale I think that the plan was to use the proceeds for deleveraging as well as for buybacks. Is that still the plan? Would you be considering metals investments as well to secure more aluminum can sheet? Or how are you thinking about the proceeds used at this point? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: No, I think - this is Scott. I think largely still in line. We'll use about half the after-tax proceeds to pay down debt and get our leverage back in the range of three times and then the other half to buy back shares. And then the cash we flow next year, a lot of that will be able to go to buy back shares. In terms of investment, I think the supply chain is making pretty good investments. So we always are looking at things opportunistically if we can create a competitive advantage. But I don't see a lot of need for big investments from that standpoint.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks a lot and Scott thanks for all your help over the years.
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed.
Mike Roxland: Thank you, Dan, Howard, Scott for taking my questions. Scott congrats on your well-deserved retirement and Howard welcome to the Ball team.
Howard Yu: Thanks. Thank you.
Mike Roxland: Dan, you mentioned Ball and the broader industry really having excess capacity in North America, and you really kind of highlighted the mass beer issue troubling the company. If next year, let's call it out, your Bud Light remains weak. Can you help us think about how the company will compensate for a potential permanent volume loss? And could some of that be offset by the recent deal that Bud Light entered into with UFC?
DanFisher: That's a great comment. I'm not a big UFC fan. So I don't know if those are huge, Bud Light drinkers or not, if that's a white space, but in all seriousness. It's going to take a period of time the beer on shelf in retailers in C-stores, we will - it will be there. And so, folks like Constellation, they continue to grow, they continue to add capacity, and they're a big partner of us. We're partners with all the major brewers. And so, as they step into taking share and taking volume, it will be somewhat of a natural offset. Obviously, the fastest return for volume for Ball is that Bud Light or Budweiser figures out, something to put on the shelves at selves in place of that. We are - there's a minor reset that happens in the fall with retailers. So we're seeing some uplift in terms of a favorable mix with some of the other brewers, but it's not going to substantiate until the first half of next year when there's bigger resets. So that will be indicative of how folks within the - in the industry and the space are going to play that. I do think the amount of money being spent by Budweiser on Bud Light, they've said it publicly. They're spending a lot more. I think four times is the number in terms of reestablishing that brand and yet to be determined, but over 12 to 18 months, I think the beer space, ready-to-drink cocktails, all of these will start to find their way on to those shelves and we'll benefit from that, we'll benefit from that disproportionately as we have been adversely impacted by the Bud Light. So I think our recovery is going to look good. It will start in the second quarter of next year, second, third and fourth quarter will become easier comps for us. The first quarter will be challenged because of Bud Light, in particular, did well. Budweiser did well in the first quarter. But I don't think we're going to have to make any further network changes. I think we're in a really good spot. We're managing that and we've got dry powder for what we believe will be a resurgent top line here over the course of the next two to three years. So that's probably more than you wanted, but I know it's a big topic, and it's certainly a big topic for Ball.
Mike Roxland: No, that's great color. I really appreciate it. And then just one - my follow-up question. Can you just remind us of some of the drivers that you have your disposal to offset the earnings dilution from the Aerospace sale when it occurs in the first half of next year?
DanFisher: The biggest one is going to be reduction in interest expense.
Scott Morrison: We should say, with a couple of billion dollars plus debt reduction, we'll save over $100 million of interest costs next year. Buying back the shares. Obviously, if you're going to buy back a couple of billion dollars’ worth of shares, that takes a little bit of time. So you don't get the benefit of that, you'll get it over a period of time. I would say those are the kind of the first things that will - you'll see the difference.
DanFisher: Yes, interest expense and improved operating earnings out of our core business, we'll give you more detail. I mean, we're certainly going to be shooting for offsetting that as soon as we can in terms of the run rate. So you'll have a far better cash-generative business on the sales output. We'll be spending a lot less capital. So it should - and then we'll be buying back a lot of stock and so the combination of those are - should be great return of value to our shareholders moving forward.
Scott Morrison: And the last several years, all the free cash flow that we generate usually really comes out of the beverage business, not the Aerospace business. So it doesn't change our cash flow profile very much.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Thanks very much, and good luck in 4Q.
DanFisher: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Phil Ng: Hi, guys. Well, Scott wanted to echo the same sentiment. Thanks for all the help over the years. And Howard, welcome, looking forward to working with you.
Howard Yu: Thanks, thank you.
Phil Ng: My first question is around the camp facility that's coming out. How much capacity does that come out? And where does that bring you from an operating rate standpoint in North America at this point? You guys have obviously taken some actions outside of Kent capacity and fixed cost out of things. Any color on how much cost savings we should expect to see that's incremental going to 2024?
DanFisher: Yes. So with the Kent facility, that was a leased facility. Maybe I'll give you a little bit about that facility. It's a leased facility. We acquired this, as you know, as part of the Rexam acquisition. It was started in 1971. We've got 126 folks there, two lines, 12-ounce standard and this will cease operation in the first half of '24. Typically, a facility of this size is in the $20 million, $30 million savings range. We'll offset some of that savings with a little bit of additional freight. So yes, somewhere in that neighborhood of $20 million next year, $20 million to $30 million. I guess how you should be thinking about it for a half year of that, I've given you an annualized number.
Phil Ng: Okay. And based on some of the cost savings and the buybacks and reduced interest expense, can you guys get back to 10% to 15% EPS growth next year?
DanFisher: That's a great question. The timing of the close will matter and how fast we buy back shares will matter. But I - as we sit here today, that is certainly our goal is not just to get back in that range but to exceed that.
Phil Ng: Okay. And just one last one for me, a cleanup question. The slugs facility that is down. How is that going to impact your EBITDA in 2024? I know there's some offset from an insurance standpoint. Do you plan on rebuilding that facility to help us think through out some of the moving pieces?
DanFisher: Right now, we have enough supply to manage. So from an EBITDA standpoint, we'll be in good shape. We are thinking about what we do with that footprint because this is something, Phil, where you can send this product over very long distances. So not to go down a rabbit hole there, but we're going to evaluate that and the insurance proceeds will be more than enough to potentially recapitalize that facility. We just need to figure out what's the best place to do that and serve our customers.
Phil Ng: Thank you.
DanFisher: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Jeff Sikoskus] with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. I think you have $1 billion coming due in the fourth quarter and maybe $790 of low-cost debt in the first quarter of '24. How do you plan to approach that?
Scott Morrison: Yes. We've got $1 billion coming due in a couple of weeks. Well, we did a bond deal back in May, that have turned out to be a very opportune time. So we have a lot of cash on our balance sheet, and we'll use the proceeds from that bond offering and cash on the balance sheet to take care of the one in November here in a couple of weeks. And then the one in March, right, that's a very low cost. So we will pay that off on the last day that we possibly can from cash that we'll generate here in the fourth quarter and then maybe a little bit of revolver to retire that. And then once we close on the aerospace transaction, we'll pay down debt to the tune of $2 billion plus, and we'll determine at the time which pieces of debt we retire at that point. So I think we're in a really good place from a maturity standpoint and being able to deal with any upcoming maturities. Then we've got $3 billion of cash and committed credit to.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for that. When you sell the Aerospace business, does it perfectly carve out? Or are there stranded costs that are left over or opportunities to reduce overhead?
DanFisher: Almost perfectly carved out, we will absolutely take a look at the Ball business structure, op model, all of those things moving forward and make sure that we're efficient and fit for purpose for the markets we're going to participate and how we win in the marketplace with our customers. So but it's minimal in terms of the overhang. It's really a business that whether it's the IT, the firewalls, the construction, I think we've got overlap of an HR system in a little bit on the financial at the corporate level. So very little overhang.
Unidentified Analyst: It's like $10 million or $20 million?
DanFisher: I haven't seen the most recent number, you're probably not that far off. It's insignificant debt. Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Gabe Hajde: Good morning, everyone, at the Ball and I'll echo other analysts have said to Scott and Howard, respectively. You said a lot, Dan, in terms of expectations for top line, specifically volumes, and there's a lot of things that can impact that when we're talking about weather, whether we're talking about promotions and Bud Light, et cetera. But you made a specific comment that you would expect volumes to kind of track below. I think what you've communicated in the past of what you'd expect, specifically North America to track. So call it, I think you guys have said 2% to 4%. So I'm curious if that's an industry comment or a Ball comment, and that's sort of based on what, meaning contracts and things that you have in your hand. And then secondarily, I guess, similar volume question, but in Europe, is this based on your customer interactions and obviously, kind of maybe expectation for the consumer to continue to be pressured that you're a little bit more negative on volume in the short term here, i.e., the next six months? And then South America, again, relative to our modeling was a little bit short. When I look at profitability versus history, it's a little bit below. But I don't know if that's a competitive issue. I know you called out some regional and customer mix. I also know ends are a little bit more profitable down there depending on when they're sold. I know there's a lot in there on pack, but just for clarity, sort of what bulk specifically is expecting in those three arenas?
DanFisher: Okay. Let's start with South America. So South America we were down slightly versus our expectations because of Argentina, it's Argentina. That's what it is. So, I wouldn't read much more into it. The volumes were in line in Brazil, maybe a little better. Our earnings were in line, maybe a little better in Brazil, but it's just the deterioration of Argentina and some unique taxes also that the government put in place. So we're going to be dealing with a little bit of volatility there for a period of time. But like I said, we'll have a significant inflection in Q4. South America is in a much better shape, obviously, than it was even at the beginning of the year. So we're very constructive on South America with the exception of the carve out of Argentina. In Europe, the volumes are going to be a little bit softer. I'd say the biggest difference between what we called out at the end of the second quarter what we're calling out today is like a weaker Europe, and I think you're hearing that from all of our competitors as well. It's a bit softer in consumer. I'm not overly concerned. It doesn't take much for growth. That market has grown for 20-plus years consistently, and it will return to growth, but the end consumer is a little weaker right now. And I do think the periodic shift six months is your characterization. I don't think you're far off there. And then in North America, I do believe, just to parse out my comments. We're not growing at 2% to 4% in the industry. It's 0% to 2% in that range right now. And it's because, obviously, the pricing behavior that we experienced in the last 18 months and a significantly weaker in consumer, which everyone is commenting on. So, I do believe there's a return to the 2% to 4% growth. But whether it happens in 2024 or the second half of '24 or in '25, I'm just being completely honest, is like what - where the end consumer is right now and what the pricing behaviors with our customers, we'll be the instrument, which it inflects up or down. Good news is, like I've said, we're running for the lower end of that range, both from an industry and from a Ball specific perspective, and we'll make more money and we'll flow more cash. But until that end consumer gains a little strength returning to the growth levels that I indicated a year or 18 months ago. I don't see that in the near term.
Gabe Hajde: Appreciate - all the color, Dan really. On the cash flow side, if I did the math right, and I think, Scott, you were talking about, I want to say, directionally, a $300 million working capital inflow this year. I wanted to confirm that, see if anything has changed there? And then when we start thinking about next year, and you guys have talked a lot about basically $4 billion of proceeds earmarked, I think there's directionally $800 million to $1 billion of AR factoring out there. I don't know if you guys would think about transitioning that to more permanent financing or using part of the proceeds to pay that down as well, because again, giving you guys credit for cash flow next year, I'm coming up with a different leverage number than sort of three. Just curious.
Scott Morrison: Yes, you're directionally right on the working capital number. And actually, one of the things that Howard and I and our team has talked about is unwinding some of that factoring. So that could be part of the whole use of proceeds. The end of the day, leverage is leverage, whether it's on balance sheet or off balance sheet. So we may take an opportunity to do some of that.
DanFisher: Yes. I will echo those comments. That is one thing that we're rolling around. And I do think it's time to start retiring some of these programs. And we've got a couple that are more expensive than we'd like. And I think we've got a targeted list that we'll go after. And the return of proceeds as we indicated back when we made our public comments, there's still $400 million, $500 million that we said we'd hold on to on the balance sheet, that would be used for things exactly like you've indicated.
Gabe Hajde: Okay, thank you. I apologize for George here. The early crystal ball...
DanFisher: Never apologize for wanting to ask questions about can exciting business.
Gabe Hajde: Just real quick. The crystal ball on working capital then for next year, it kind of things play out that we would expect?
Scott Morrison: I think it's way too early to talk about that. I mean you can get - it's going to look wonky because we're going to get all these proceeds from the sale of the transaction and the tax payments on those proceeds is going to flow through operating cash flow. So we'll have to break out and explain exactly what we're doing but at the end of the day, I think you'll get a clear picture of what our balance sheet is going to look like and what the P&L is going to look like going forward, once we get to completion of the Aerospace transaction, and what the business looks like going forward. So the cash flow will look lumpy next year because for one reason is because of that.
DanFisher: So there's the cash flow comment, which I totally agree with Scott, and we're getting to our balance sheet, it's going to be in great shape at the end of the year. In terms of the working capital, so if you're looking at DSO, DPO, ITO, that's how we run our day-to-day, our average working capital level will be significantly less next year than our average this year because of all the great work the teams have done to get our balance sheet in order. And that's how I get paid at the end of the day. So that's how EVA works. So yes, I don't know endpoints if we'll be able to improve much. I think the focus will be to it's always to get better, whether it's spare parts, inventory or finished good or coil stock or on and on and on. But the average will be better, significantly better year-over-year.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you, Dan.
DanFisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Adam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
DanFisher: Morning.
Adam Samuelson: Morning. There's been a lot of ground covered. Maybe just as we think about especially North America and Europe, a lot of discussion on beer. Is there any more distinction by customer category you would make in terms of actual pockets of strength versus areas where you've been surprised at where demand has surprised the downside apart from just the regional point on Europe, specifically and mass beer, obviously, in the U.S.?
DanFisher: Yes, I think Europe is a little easier. It's just a weaker in consumer right now across the board. Literally everything is down to varying degrees. If I give you a little bit more detail into the U.S. market, I commented on this earlier on the call, and we anticipated this heading into the third quarter. So we saw private label actually grow in the CSD category to the tune of about 3% in the third quarter. It's not a surprise, but it has happened. So I think that - and they have taken share against a couple of the bigger players. So that was an important distinction, I think, within the quarter. You're ready to drink cocktails are still growing at nearly 50%. So it's a staggering growth trajectory there. Hard sell-throughs are still declining off of a really good high here a couple of years ago. Import beer grew, which is - you can see us filling the hole a bit from Bud Light domestic beer down in that kind of 4.5%, 5%, which is largely in line with what we expected. Q4 is where you would hope to see a bit of an inflection and some movement and I think that's still a wait and see relative to the really big customer in the North America marketplace. But nothing really surprised us. I think the things that have momentum continue to have momentum with the exception of a trade down, really that happened in the CSD area from the premium brands down into private label.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then as you - in the other nonreportable business, you talked about the growth in aerosol, obviously, there's the main issue with the manufacturing plant in Virginia. I'm not sure I heard anything about kind of where things stand with the cups business and the march of that business towards profitability and kind of how close you're maybe getting to some bigger customers that could fill up that capacity.
DanFisher: We are still having conversations with regard to cups. You need the big inflection point to come out of food service. We're bullish on the conversations, but a couple of those transactions and wins need to happen for us to really inflect toward breakeven, we're doing better this year than last. We'll do better next year. I need for one or two significant wins for us to get back to breakeven. But it's not that far away. But until you execute that trade, it's not in the near term.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. All right. That's very helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: Mr. Fisher, there are no further questions at this time.
Dan Fisher: Great. All right. We'll let this - thank you, Frank. We look forward to talking to you at year-end. Hope everybody has a healthy and safe holiday season. We're certainly thankful and appreciative for everything that Scott has done for the company. I look forward to introducing more of you to Howard here in the near future. So enjoy the holidays, and hopefully, we'll see most of you here in the next couple of months. Be well.
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Have a great day, everyone.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Ball Corporation 2Q 2023 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 3, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Fisher, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Malika. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s second quarter 2023 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today’s earnings release. Historical financial results for the divested Russia operations will continue to be reflected in the Beverage Packaging EMEA segment. See Note 1, Business Segment Information, for additional information about the sale agreement and a quarterly breakout of Russia’s historical sales and comparable operating earnings. In addition, the release also includes a summary of non-comparable items, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Late in the quarter, the company also announced that is considering options for its aerospace business. There are limitations regarding the depth of commentary we will provide on that topic today. If and or when additional comments are necessary, they will be made via a separate public press release. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some brief introductory remarks. Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then we will finish up with closing comments. Our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and Q&A. Let me begin by thanking our employees for working safely and with the utmost level of agility while fulfilling our customers' needs. On our first quarter call, we said that our second quarter would be choppy and that was the case. Our team delivered solid second quarter results amid tough year-over-year comparisons, including $47 million of higher interest expense, the $40 million of operating earnings headwind from the Russian sale and global beverage volumes down 11% driven by the Russian sale impact and a notable domestic beer brand experiencing demand disruption in North America. I'm proud to say that our team did an excellent job of managing both costs and working capital levels to deliver the quarter and position the business for a stronger second half. Looking forward, we will continue to benefit from notable inflation recovery, cost-out actions, and improved operational efficiencies. Our inventory levels are in good shape with plans to improve further. Our North America team is managing in real-time the balance of the U.S. mass beer brand [Indiscernible] and our improved demand forecast of other customers which should unlock additional opportunities during the second half. Cash flow is kicking in and we are studying opportunities to accelerate deleveraging and the multi-year return of value to shareholders, while also developing additional innovative packaging solutions to grow the business going forward. Around the globe, beverage cans continue to win relative to other substrates and we continue to leverage the contributions of our two new facilities in India, our customer mix, scale, plant footprint, innovation, and capable teams across the organization to ensure the best outcomes for all our stakeholders. In our aerospace and aluminum aerosol businesses, operational performance and demand for our products continue to grow. In aerospace, our one-not-book backlog increased one billion and the unique technologies we provide to support environmental and national security needs remains in high demand. And in our global aluminum aerosol business, we continue to serve new categories and offer reuse, refill bottle innovations to a broader set of customers and occasions. As we look ahead, all of our businesses will continue to unlock additional value for Ball stakeholders in 2023 and beyond. Consistent with our prior commentary, in 2023, we remain positioned to deliver approximately $750 million of free cash flow to deleverage and return value to shareholders, and in 2023, we anticipate the potential of achieving the low end of our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings for share growth, including the Russian business sale headwind and exceeding that long-term comparable diluted EPS growth goal, excluding the Russian sale headwind. During the Q&A, Scott and I will strive to provide additional clarity on the external environment and cadence for the remainder of 2023 based on what we know today. Our global beverage teams continue to position our businesses to deliver the year and have an eye on the future. For the full year and incorporating year-to-date trends, our customer mix and excluding Russia, we now estimate flat global volume growth for Ball, with North America being down low single digits, South America volume up mid-single digits, and EMEA volume up mid-single digits. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and everyone listening today. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Second quarter of 2023 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.61 versus $0.82 in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter sales decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022, lower volumes, currency translation, and the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, partially offset by the pass-through of inflationary costs. In the second quarter, net comparable earnings decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher interest expense, the headwind from the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022, and lower volumes, as well as higher corporate costs, partially offset by the contractual pass-through of inflationary costs, fixed cost savings, lower depreciation expense, and SG&A cost out initiatives. To reiterate our prior earnings call commentary, we have been and will continue to proactively manage regional supply demand balance across our system of plants in the near term. Starting in the third quarter, segment earnings in North America will accelerate through the majority of the anticipated contractual inflation recovery, having kicked in July 1. In EMEA, the business will lap its last Russian earnings headwind in the third quarter, and then accelerate to an improved level of earnings in the fourth quarter as they move beyond this multi-quarter headwind and the start of costs for the two new plants. In South America, customer and product mix, which has unfavorably influenced the seasonally slower second quarter, will reverse and consistent with our prior commentary, we anticipate a more robust second half in Brazil as customer hedges roll off and the fourth quarter summer selling season kicks in. As we sit here today, some very consistent commentary and key metrics. We ended the second quarter in a very solid liquidity position with approximately $2.65 billion in cash and committed credit facilities. 2023 CapEx will be in the range of $1.2 billion, driven by cash outflows related to prior year's projects. 2024 CapEx is targeted to be in the range of GAAP D&A levels. We are targeting free cash flow of approximately $750 million in 2023 and focusing on deleveraging. Our 2023 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 19%. Full year 2023 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $450 million. We anticipate full year corporate undistributed costs recorded and other non-reportable to be in the range of $80 million. Including the $86 million Russian business sale operating earnings headwind, comparable operating earnings should increase nearly $200 million. And full year 2023 comparable D&A will likely be in the range of $550 million. As we look forward to incorporating near-term demand trends, year end 2023 net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to trend in the range of 3.7 times. And in future years, we will drive that lower. Last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend. And as Dan mentioned, reducing leverage is our key focus prior to resuming share repurchases. As fellow owners, we continue to manage business through the lens of EVA and cash stewardship and we will effectively manage our supply chain and customers in this current environment to secure the best cash earnings and EVA outcome for our shareholders. With that, turn it back to you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Scott. We continue to believe that given the economic environment and global dynamics impacting our world, it is a great time for investors to get up to speed on Ball. Our improved results following the challenging 2022 is progressing. Our products and technologies are resilient and provide solutions for our customers. Our focus remains on delivering earnings, free cash flow and high quality products to our customers and consumers. And as leverage continues to come down and free cash flow expands, our return of value to shareholders will grow in 2024 and beyond. Thank you to everyone listening today. And with that, Malika, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first phone question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.
George Staphos: Hi, thank you. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details, and congratulations on the performance. I guess, the first question I had, can you talk -- I haven't tried to reverse engineer the full-year volume guidance relative to the year-to-date, but what kind of volume trends are you seeing early in the third quarter across the region? And are there any regions left with any notable filled product that needs to be destock? How would you -- have you think about that, guys?
Dan Fisher: Yes, thank you. In the mass beer space, I think you'd have to look at that on a net basis. Clearly, there's one customer that's got more filled goods right now than the others, and I think they've commented on that. There is a little bit within our portfolio in terms of the energy space where we're working through some inventory. Our largest energy customer in our space in North America is growing at a slower rate than the balance of that space. And so, the scanner data is reflecting more growth than our shipment sales. That normalizes, we believe in Q4 based on the projections that we have. Nothing notable. We're in a really good inventory spot, George. You can see that reflected in our cash generation in Q2. You always have, this is the softer period for South America, so there's nothing really of news there. We expect to start building inventory here in the quarter to execute against the back half of the quarter and then peak season for that part of the world. So absent the obvious mass beer player, not as much.
George Staphos: Okay. And actually, what I was getting at to some degree was what you were seeing in South America. So in South America, you -- from your vantage point, not a big amount of de-stocking, if anything, that needs to get done at the customer level. That would be fair?
Dan Fisher: No, we've been running.
George Staphos: Other than you large -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Yes, that's correct. There's nothing meaningful in South America. You always run to get, you're always doing maintenance and there's always a level of curtailment in Q2. And so, there's just not a lot of room to run additionally to build inventory, because you're already planning that you're going to be running full out in Q3. The inventory builds, if you have that effect, typically it shows up at the end of our fiscal year down in South America. If things aren't selling through in Q4, you usually have a bit more inventory heading into Q1. So we're in a really good position inventory-wise. That was something that we commented heading into the quarter. The teams and the plants managed that tremendously, even with the mass beer inflection that showed up in the quarter and persisted throughout the quarter.
George Staphos: Okay, Dan, thanks for that. I want to sort of come back to part of the question as I asked it and ask you to follow and then I'll step down just to be fair to everybody else. So what trends are you seeing early in the quarter volume-wise across the regions if you can talk about, put a number on that if that's possible? And then from our research and contacts, we've seen an uptick in promotional activity. We haven't necessarily seen a pickup in consumption yet. How would you have us think about the efficiency and the yield on promotion and the level of promotion that you're seeing into 3Q? And are we beginning to see some finally, some uptick in beer just based on what we're seeing out of the scanners and why, if that's the case, would you be confident about that continuing the rest of the year? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes, that's a good question. Let me see if I can parse out the elements of that. Let's look at North America. There's nothing really to report in terms of inflection one way or another in South America because it's still winter there. We wouldn't see that behavior until the second half of Q3. So nothing to report other than the conversations that we're having with our customers. Again, I'll be down there next week. They're planning to deliver against what we've modeled in right now, which is a pretty nice inflection of volume heading into Q4 Brazil. We've comment on this previously. Bullish on the Brazil -- Brazil was the first to go into a recession and experience inflation and higher interest rates. They're starting to relieve some of that. So the combination of that, plus previously disclosed comments in and around hedge positions, all of that is playing out as we would hope. The only thing in South America obviously is the question mark in and around Argentina, but Brazil is stronger and we still believe that what we've contemplated for the back half of the year is going to manifest. In North America, both Scott and I have been very public with our comments on what we were seeing throughout the second quarter relative to the mass beer dynamic. And they have been confirmed by our customers. One is our beer customers are always running full out in the second quarter and even most of the third quarter. So if there's a mixed shift that's taking place, it's going to come from working capital or filled goods. So the scanner data won't be necessarily a one-to-one reflection of what we're experiencing. We believe that there will be resets at retailers. Some of the customers that have opportunities to step into elevated positions or more velocity on shelves or a bigger shelf space on shelves, they're gearing up for that. You won't really see that until the fourth quarter is how we're contemplating in our numbers. And in terms of promotion, I think the way you characterized, it is correct. There has been promotion that keep in mind. The promotions coming off in many instances, staggering price increases over the last two years. So, it's not about promotion, as much as that is the intentionality of volume momentum. What we've seen in the CSD category is we have seen private label gain share. And that is something new relative to what we've seen the last couple years. That is generally a catalyst to drive for more volume and volume momentum. And we've always thought that given Q4 comps for certain of our customers, they will be more inclined to push volume. In the fourth quarter, conversations with those customers would signal that they're thinking about it similarly. But until it happens and until they find the right price elasticity and volume momentum trigger, I think they're doing a lot of activity. I see the same data. It's not having the intended results of driving volume. I think it means that they will need to be more aggressive, and I know that they don't like to be losing share to private label. So that's a lot there, but that's how we're viewing it, and that's how we've modeled it. We don't expect to see a great deal of uplift in Q3 versus previous, from a sequential standpoint, Q2, with the exception of we believe, mass beer within our portfolio will continue to be negative. Europe continues to grow. Slight growth in Q2. We had a very good second quarter last year. I'm commenting, excluding Russia. We will continue to grow as our plant system ramps up. The new capacity was needed for us to really step into growth in the mid-single digits, but everything is still in line and alignment with us delivering against that over the back half of the year. 
George Staphos: Thank you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Bryan Burgmeier: Hi, this is actually Bryan Burgmeier on for Anthony. Thanks for your question. Dan, Scott, you've been asked about the possibility of selling or spinning aerospace for many, many years. So, why now for the strategic review? Did something change for Ball for the aerospace business? Is it about capital allocation or returns? Just any detail you can add there and maybe why this is happening now?
Dan Fisher: Yes, why now is, if you look back five years ago versus today, the business is much bigger, much healthier, much more profitable, and it could fundamentally stand on its own. Those are the key cruxes for why you could potentially do something else with this business. It's really a manifestation of that business has performed tremendously and gotten to a point where it's an incredibly valuable asset. We believe that was the case. And so, we ran a process to validate that. Early indications are it is a valuable business. If and when I've got more to talk about, I'll let you know. It's really nothing about capital allocation and return threshold. It is just that it's a valuable asset. It's increasingly so. And we always need to look at our shareholder value equation and make sure that that asset is sitting in the right spot for the long-term generation.
Bryan Burgmeier: Understood. Thank you. One quick follow-up here is, Dan, during the quarter, I think you talked about kind of retail points and the supply chain being displaced by the customer mix developments in U.S. beer. Do you have a sense of where we are kind of in that process and maybe when Ball start to see the benefits of being exposed to some of the other brewers that are doing very well right now?
Dan Fisher: There's been very minimal movements in terms of retail displacement. I know those questions are being posed. There's a significant reset that happens kind of tail in the Q3 heading in the Q4 across most of the major retailers. So you will see this net impact fully manifest. Probably not until the first half of 2024 will all of the shakeout happen. So I'm not looking at anything appreciably changing in Q3. But the customers that have the opportunity to take a broader position in the retail, they will be gearing up their supply chains. They will be entering into these new retail positions over the course of the third quarter. And then you will start to see Q4, first half of 2024, where things start to settle out.
Bryan Burgmeier: Understood. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it over.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dan Fisher: Morning Adam.
Adam Samuelson: Good morning. Maybe just a starting point on, as we think about the guidance and think there was a new kind of qualifier this quarter around kind of the potential to be at the low end of the 10% to 15% long-term kind of range. And I guess help me. Is it just a volume question more in the back half of the uncertainty with some easier comps and the magnitude of bounce that drives kind of the introduction of that qualifier? Or is it further disruption in the U.S. beer? Or just help me think about range of outcomes that drive potential versus actually achieving?
Dan Fisher: I wouldn't characterize it as further deterioration of mass beer. It's going to be persistent through the third quarter. And so, yes, but from a volume standpoint, the third quarter from a mass beer standpoint, what we anticipated at the beginning year versus what we're experiencing, it's softer. And nothing's going to change here probably in the next 90 days, meaningfully, to inflect. The good news is everything that we set out to accomplish in terms of our operational performance, the PPI pass-through, the tailwinds of some inflationary benefits, the SG&A actions, the fixed cost savings, all of that is allowing us to have a line of sites at that low end. We wouldn't be there without the -- we wouldn't be able to characterize our belief in that low end without the performance of the operations right now. So, it is mass beer, and in every one of the regions, we believe there's an inflection in the fourth quarter in volume. We've talked about the CSD market. We've talked about, I think, what's going to happen in mass beer, and then also a peak season in South America with an improved economic environment in Brazil. All of those things have to come through, but they were already baked in. What wasn't baked in is mass beer in North America.
Adam Samuelson: Got it. Now, that's very helpful. And as you look at -- start to think about 2024 in that context, and start working with customers, obviously, some of the market share shifts could present incremental opportunities. And I guess as you think about the mass beer channel in 2024 volumetrically, if that rebounds, do you think you gain disproportionately from that? Or is it some of that potentially grew back to the one of the captive can makers that are known by one of your big customers?
Dan Fisher: No, I don't believe the captive can makers will benefit. Obviously, they're going to prioritize in the short term their assets. One in particular that's having the marketing issue, we've come to an agreement that we've got a stable go forward position where we understand what the bottom is. And so, we should see inflection off of that, if they're able to turn around. And then to your point, we are with everyone in the beer space. So we should see net benefits into 2024. I would characterize Q2 and Q3 as a bit of a trough for us right now. So relative to that, and then what happens in the mass beer space and clearly the economy writ large, there's reason for optimism for sure in 2024 and beyond.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. All right. Now, that color is very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is not open. 
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. I want to circle back to the Brazilian market and everything going on. There's been some macro volatility debates about glass recycling, the relative cost of various packaging substrates. Obviously, the rebound is highlighted and the potential for the rebounds highlighted in your press release. Can you take a step back and just how should we be thinking about that, that evolution during the kind of the fourth quarter which you already highlighted and in the 2024 in terms of kind of like the normalized progression there, just because it seems like they're just a plethora of moving parts which we have to consider? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes. So what we've stated in an inflationary environment, recessionary environment, which is clearly what Brazil's been saddled with here the last couple of years. Two or three times when we've had similar macro events in that country, we've seen shared shift to returnable glass in the five to high single digit range. We experienced the same thing from second half of 2021 all the way through today. As -- a lot of it has to do with the economics, lot of it has to do with the per unit price point of aluminum, the aluminum package in the hedge positions that were constructed by our customers. The cost of aluminum has come off, the hedge positions have come off, the economy is rebounding, inflation is declining, interest rates are coming off. So, all of those things point to we should normalize back to mid 50%, low 50% can penetration in Brazil. So we're betting on can penetration improving in Q3, Q4 and stabilizing in Q1 for 2024. We haven't done a ton of work on 2024 right now, but I would think about it's principally an improved economy and a returnable glass shift that took place during inflationary period, which has always come back to cans, because that's the preferred choice and the preferred choice of our customers. We expect the same thing to happen. It's too early in the process given, excuse me, in the year given it's winter there to see much movement if anything, but we anticipate that tailwind into Q3 and into Q4, more in Q4. Hopefully that helps.
Christopher Parkinson: Of course, understood. And just a very quick follow-up on the North American market regarding your volume commentary there. There's been a lot of start and go on various promotional excitations this year and euphoria and then waning, euphoria and then coming back. How do we think about that in the mass beer market? I mean there's been some competitor commentary and optimism for CSD at least a little bit, but what are you actually seeing from your customer base and how is that actually flowing in to your outlook for the second half? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: We began the year with the expectation that we wouldn't see promotional activity, but promotional activity does not generate volume momentum. We thought volume momentum would come in Q4 when there are more challenging comps. We still anticipate that. We didn't build in much in terms of volume momentum happening in the first three quarters of the year. And even though you're right, there's increased activity on promotion. It hasn't been enough to move volume. There has been share shift from the major CSD players into private label over the last four weeks. That is usually a light bulb that goes off and folks behave differently as a result of that, but I'm encouraged that what we built into our plan heading into the year will manifest in the fourth quarter. I don't see any appreciable movement in the third quarter, because the promotion to your point is happening, but it's not manifesting in volume momentum yet.
Christopher Parkinson: Helpful color. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey guys, good morning.
Dan Fisher: Hey, good morning Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi: Good morning. Obviously a lot going on. If food is just going to step back and you know the first quarter beverage packaging North and Central America, you know volumes were down roughly 5% and then in 2Q down 8.5. Is that delta purely mass beer or is there anything else that perhaps was a little bit worse on a year-over-year basis?
Dan Fisher: I think you characterized it correctly. It's the net beer impact in the second quarter. There were pretty stable trends across everything and it kind of lends into my previous comments on the CSD sector. You know energy continues to -- almost all the categories are performing year-over-year in line with the exception of mass beer and that fell off. I think net, there was negative 2.5 points of growth in the first quarter, net minus 4.5 points and obviously our mix would have weighted us further down.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that and then in terms of the curtailment that you're doing in terms of managing supply et cetera across multiple regions. What was that number for 2Q and how are you thinking about that for the back half of the year as well?
Dan Fisher: The curtailment in South America is exactly what we planned. I mean candidly it's negligible in terms of the curtailment that we planned in 2Q versus what actually happened. You could say the delta that you just confirmed and volume that was additional curtailment that we took in the second quarter. Apart from that we've got a little bit more curtailment that will manifest throughout the third quarter versus what we entered the year with because of the mass beer phenomenon. Apart from that everyone's in alignment with what we entered the year with and what we expected.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got you. And then just one final one. You seem generally constructive on Europe on beverage packaging side based on what you've seen so far this year. Just judging by the commentary and just some of the macro news. It seems like the European consumer is just much weaker in terms of spending and trade-downs and so on and so forth. Has your view changed at all in terms of the outlook for Europe specifically as it relates to the beverage can or is it pretty much the same?
Dan Fisher: The outlook for the long term and the medium term continue to -- it is just a wealth of opportunity for us in terms of substrate shift given our current position. The end consumer is absolutely weaker than where we entered the year because of everything you cited. The can generally benefits from the on-prem off-prem shift even some of the trade-downs are beneficial. We've got a more diversified portfolio that has helped us heavier energy, heavier CSD. Beer has been the -- from a pan-European standpoint. Beer has been the softer category, there but I think our portfolio has helped us. And so we see we see a little bit more opportunity given that than maybe some of the other comments area that's been that's been put out there. But yes consumer in the second half of the year softer. We're still going to see nice growth and we're still going to -- that business continues to perform extremely well.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Security. Please go ahead your line is open.
Mike Roxland: Thank you, Scott and Dan, thanks for taking my questions.
Dan Fisher: You bet Mike.
Mike Roxland: I might as well jump on the mass beer right over here and ask the question just you know. How are you just thinking about your portfolio and your end market exposure going forward. I think so, you made the comment that you could see some you know some shares shift later this year until 2024. So you could see you know mass beer improved and then your volumes are probably not possibly dead out but if there isn't that recovery in mass beer what happens to your volumes then. And so, I guess the question really is, one, let's assume that mass beer doesn't recover what happens to your volumes then. And two, are you actually considering trying to shift your production to other product categories. I made a comment in the press release that you said you're trying to align yourself with customers that are experiencing higher growth, so that means, you're trying to really shift or minimize your exposure to mass beer relative to other categories that maybe have more potential on a go forward basis.
Dan Fisher: Yes Mike let me, this is all North America related I'm assuming, so I'll start there. Let's just talk about the categories, because we're spending an awful lot of time on the domestic beer category, which is which is down and I believe we're at a trough so it will recover from this point and it's consistent with all of the customer commentary within that space. But domestic beer is down 4.5% last 12 weeks, which is a further versus 52 weeks down, nearly 3%. So there's an acceleration of the decline obviously because of the marketing issue, but import beer is up 11% , non-alcoholic beer is up 27% cider is up 8% S&B is up 15%, ready to drink cocktails are up 41%. As we've seen the evolution of our customers transition to beverage companies, because they're going to be forced to put stuff on the shelf that sells. We've only experienced this phenomenon here for the past 12 weeks and there's a lot that is going to be repositioned and given we participate with everyone in the market, we should win with whatever's going to win in the market. At what percentage? It's a great question. We don't know, but the trough that we're experiencing now in the second quarter the third quarter will improve we should benefit from that in the first half of 2024 I would expect continued benefit throughout that first half of the year. But there's a lot of t questions. but I'm confident that these are customers understand their world real well and they know that they need to be putting stuff on the shelf that's going to sell and folks will find a home. Nothing's going to change candidly from that import beer number. The Hispanic population continues to grow. They already have all gut plans to lean into that to add more capacity. So there's an ability for those folks to accelerate. And obviously we're very close to them. So I'm encouraged. From today moving forward I'm encouraged what's going to show up in the first half of 2024 and beyond.
Mike Roxland: Got that. Thank you for the color. And then just one quick question I think you recently restarted production Avital [ph] and Venus, George. And so wondering, I think that plan was taken down due to the weak macro and also because you lost a customer contract. So wondering is you need to bring them up and restart the plant because of your anticipation of better Brazil demand. Did you win new business? Just wondering why you've went up and restart. And I think that was done within the last month or so?
Dan Fisher: Yes. We're bringing it up for the other customers in that market that are winning and we anticipate that they will win further and take further share as a result of the one brewer who filed for bankruptcy at the tail end of Q1, that's one issue. But we're not bringing that hands up for the customer that we originally built it for.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Very clear. Good luck for second half.
Dan Fisher: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit more on two things. So first off, when you look into the back half of the year and in the next year, you do have relatively easier comps for next year, already down to mid-single digits on the volume side and high single digits for North America. So would that allow you to get back into the, say, that low single digit range for next year's volume growth? And are there any other capacity considerations we should consider when thinking about how your volumes evolve and maybe settle into that low single digit range?
Dan Fisher: Thanks for the question. As we sit here today, we haven't spent a whole lot of time on 2024, I think for both Europe and South America, given they're growing, we continue to believe that growth will persist. So the question mark will obviously be North America, but as I stated several times in this call, I think Q2 and Q3 we're at a trough. So we should see improved volumes over these periods. I believe that will be enough to push us into growth territory. So the aggregate position and the answer to your question is yes, I believe we will be in that low single digit growth for 2024. We've also stated several times that the capacity we've put in place over the last two to three years is enough to grow into at that range. And so, we should see nice lift in terms of profitability and performance without having to spend additional growth capital. We've spent the growth capital we need and I don't anticipate much in the beverage business over the next two years from a growth CapEx standpoint.
Arun Viswanathan: And so with that comp, I guess, when you think about free cash flow, I imagine it could be nicely up over the next couple of years from that 750 base. Could you just touch on that opportunity as well as the capital that you plan to spend?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I'll have Scott.
Scott Morrison: Yes, I can get better. No, you're exactly right. I mean, we're going to spend less capital, just put up a $1.2 billion this year. Next year, we're expected to go down closer to GAAP depreciation. So all that freed up cash flow can go back to shareholders. So I think it gets better.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jeffries. Please go ahead your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you guys for taking the time and providing all the details. This is John on for Phil.
Dan Fisher: Hi, John.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. I want to start just, I know it's kind of been beaten to death a little bit, but with the North American volumes down 8.5% in the quarter, obviously much worse than the overall market. I mean, you called out, obviously, that's vastly driven by the mass beer declines. But with the additional capacity that's now in the market over where demand is kind of falling to and supply chains obviously ease globally, have you been experiencing any customer shift or pressure on your contract at this point in time in the North America business?
Dan Fisher: No pressure on the contracts at this point. I think a good reflection of that commentary would be the fact that we're passing through the inflationary mechanisms. So, if you weren't seeing that come through, I think you could probably could see that there's been some negotiation that's taken place. And that's not the case. The way I would look at volume, I think we're in a short-term dislocation for the second quarter and the third quarter because of mass beer. That correction relative to curtailments or decline shipments will revert in the second half of the year, but more meaningfully in the first half of 2024. The other thing that we've done is we've managed to inventory. So we built too much inventory last year. We've worked that off. So there's been an elevated level of curtailments relative to versus 2022. We'll be running much closer to scanner data in 2024 and Q4 likely to be a lot closer to scanner data. So those are the things that are well understood within the industry and with our customers. I think the theoretical excess capacity versus the reality versus the intentionality of running to cash, all of those things stabilized heading into 2024 in a, what I believe is a much tighter marketplace with growth underpinning every industry participant moving into 2024.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you for the details.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just touching on the, I think if I heard you correctly in the early part of the call, you said you were still exploring opportunities to accelerate the leveraging efforts. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what you were referring to? If that maybe meant some smaller divestitures or, other actions that you're taking for that do leveraging efforts?
Dan Fisher: No, we have what we were referring to as, you know, we've generated a lot of cash here in the back half of the year. We're sitting out a lot of cash. And so we have the flexibility to, you know, pay down whatever piece of the debt we want to pay down. And so that's really what that's about.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Gabe Hajde: Dan Scott, good morning. 
Dan Fisher: Morning
Gabe Hajde: I appreciate that there's been a lot of ground cover here, but maybe just because we don't have access to the industry data anymore and a perfect, I guess, lens into what the market is. Can you parse out the maybe 8.5% decline in the second quarter and sort of, what's embedded in the second half. I mean, between share shift between the market being soft and then maybe the kind of what's going on with the beer disruption? And then another volume related question in Europe. I think volume decelerated in the second quarter. I'm curious if that's a function of not having the capacity that you need. You talked about obviously the UK and the Czech facility ramping up. So, I'm just curious if that's what's driving your optimism for the second half to recover. You talked about your largest energy customer maybe being a little bit weak based on sell through in North America. They're a pretty big customer over in Europe. Is that part of what's driving the optimism or just help me understand because I'm assuming the business in Europe is sort of contracted.
Dan Fisher: Yes, maybe let me start with Europe. Everything is coming in line with what we anticipated heading into the year. Inclusive of the large energy player. The one area that's softer is beer. I think that's related to the macro environment there. So the higher single digits that we anticipated having the year are going to be closer to mid single digits, but still nice growth. And it's not a function of bringing on the capacity. The capacity that's being brought on is in the growth areas. It's going to be the capacity that's a little less utilized in the beer space. That's what's happening in Europe. Relative to North America, we had a decline, as you mentioned, of roughly 5% in the first quarter. We are in that eight and a half range for decline in the second. We will see declines in the third with a return to some volume momentum in the fourth. What happens in the mass beer space will be the indicator of is it growth? Is it flat? But that's fundamentally, it is the mass beer impact and it is the fact that we're overweight in the beer space and overweight to one customer within that space. So that's the delta.
Gabe Hajde: Okay. Maybe I didn't ask the question explicitly. Do you have any sense for what the market was down in North America? And then last one, if I can flip it in. I think there was $20 million of year-over-year improvement embedded in for the Cup's business, I think there was some basketball championship, that was a good thing for that product. Can you talk about sort of how that business is evolving and maybe expectations going into 2024?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think the overall marketplace in North America down slightly, 1%. And so the delta between that and our customer mix is really the delta there. And then on the Cup side, we're seeing incremental improvements. I think an LA Boston Series versus a Denver Miami Series would have helped the cup a little better, believe it or not, but making good ground and good traction in the food service space, things are breaking our way in terms of the regulatory environment as well on that product with Hawaii and now the mid-Atlantic's either banning or contemplating banning single-use plastic cups. So we're looking for trajectory over the second half of the year. I would not say that we will make a $20 million improvement in that business year-over-year, but we will continue to improve against it more in the $10 million range.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this moment, I'm seeing no further question on the phone lines.
Dan Fisher: All right. Thank you very much. We will look forward to talking to you again in the third quarter. Everybody enjoy the rest of your summer.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Ball Corporation 1Q 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 4, 2023. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Fisher, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, Tina, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s first quarter 2023 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today’s earnings release. Historical financial results for the divested Russia operations will continue to be reflected in the Beverage Packaging EMEA segment. See Note 1 Business Segment Information, for additional information about the sale agreement and a quarterly breakout of Russia’s historical sales and comparable operating earnings. In addition, the release also includes a summary of non-comparable items, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I will provide some brief introductory remarks, Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then we will finish up with closing comments, our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and Q&A. Let me begin by thanking our employees for working safely and efficiently, while fulfilling our customer’s needs. Collectively, we delivered strong first quarter results amid tough year-over-year comparisons, driven largely by business divestments executed in 2022. In the first quarter, every business either achieved or exceeded their operating plan. Our aluminum beverage and aerosol shipments were in line with our regional expectations, and our aerospace technologies continue to be in high demand. Notable inflation recovery, benefits of cost-out actions, improved operational efficiencies and performance in every business offset higher interest expense and taxes. With near-term macroeconomic conditions continuing to pressure consumer demand, Ball’s year-to-date global beverage can volumes were down 1.4% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Looking ahead, the breadth of retail summer promotional activity across our customer mix in North America and the continuing successful ramp-up of our two new facilities in EMEA, will be the key drivers of our ultimate 2023 shipment growth. We started 2023 with a conservative view on annual global beverage shipment trends, and we maintained that conservative second half weighted view. We have a lot of the year ahead of us and we look forward to serving our customer’s needs. As we sit here today, in advance of seeing quantifiable promotional activity, we are proactively managing our beverage operations in North and South America for cash and supply-demand balance, as we continue to bring down raw coil and finished goods inventories and return to our just-in-time supply chain management versus the just-in-case supply chain requirement during the pandemic and extended period of higher than planned growth for beverage cans. Around the globe, beverage cans continue to win relative to other substrates and we continue to leverage our customer mix, scale, regional plant networks, innovation and capable teams across the organization to ensure the best near-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes for all our stakeholders. In our aerospace and aluminum aerosol businesses, operational performance and demand for our innovative products and technologies are accelerating. In aerospace, our technologies are well positioned to deliver unimpeachable data and monitoring capabilities for both environmental and national security needs. And in our global aluminum aerosol business, we continue to serve new categories and offer reuse, refill bottle innovations to a broader set of customers and occasions. As we look ahead, all of our businesses will continue to unlock additional value for Ball stakeholders in 2023 and beyond. Consistent with our prior commentary in 2023, we remain positioned to deliver our long-term goal of 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth, inclusive of the Russian business sale headwind and we remain well positioned to generate strong free cash flow to deleverage and return value to our fellow shareholders. As we indicated in our prior call, the second quarter will remain choppy in North and South America metal beverage as we continue to work through higher inventory and manage regional production with an eye on cash. In addition, the positive momentum in our EMEA, aerospace and aluminum aerosol businesses will continue. During the Q&A, Scott and I will strive to provide additional clarity on the external environment and cadence for 2023 based on what we know today. Our global beverage teams continue to position our business to deliver the year and have an eye on the future. For the full year and incorporating year-to-date trends, our customer mix and excluding Russia, we now estimate low single-digit global volume growth for Ball, with North America being slightly down, South America volume up mid-single digits, EMEA volume up mid-single digits plus and our other non-reportable beverage business volumes up mid- to high-single digits. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. With that, I will turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. I’d like to congratulate Dan on his election to Chairman of the Board and thank John for his service as Chairman. Dan was battle-tested on many fronts in 2022 and he has the skill set and drive to take the company to new heights. First quarter 2023 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.69 versus $0.77 in the first quarter of 2022 and excluding the notable Russian aluminum packaging business sale headwind, first quarter comparable diluted earnings per share were flat versus the prior year. First quarter sales decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022, currency translation, lower volumes and the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, partially offset by the pass-through of inflationary costs. In the first quarter, net comparable earnings decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the sale of our Russian business in the third quarter of 2022, lower volumes in North and South America, and increased interest expense, partially offset by fixed cost savings, lower depreciation expense and SG&A cost-out initiatives, as well as the contractual pass-through of inflationary costs. To reiterate our prior earning’s call commentary and to help frame some of Dan’s earlier comments about choppier second quarter performance in North America and South America segment earnings, we have been and will continue to proactively manage regional supply-demand balance across our system of plants in the near-term. After July, segment earnings will reaccelerate when the majority of the contractual inflation recovery begins and a larger portion of summer selling volume flows through segment results. Also remember, the virtual power purchase agreement settlement recorded in North America’s first quarter results will not replicate in the second quarter. However, we estimate that North America’s second quarter segment results will be relatively in line with $183 million first quarter segment results reported today. In South America, customer and product mix is unfavorably influence -- influencing the seasonally slower second quarter, and consistent with our prior commentary, we anticipate a more robust second half in Brazil, as customer hedges roll off and the fourth quarter summer selling season kicks in. As we sit here today, some very consistent commentary and key metrics. We ended the first quarter in a solid liquidity position with in excess of $1.5 billion in cash and available credit facilities; 2023 CapEx will be in the range of $1.2 billion, driven by cash outflows related to prior year’s projects; 2024 CapEx is targeted to be in the range of GAAP D&A levels. We are targeting free cash flow in the range of $750 million in 2023 and focusing on deleveraging. Our 2023 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 20%. Full year 2023 interest expense is expected to be in the range of $425 million, while the first quarter corporate costs appear lower than the expected run rate. We continue to anticipate full year 2023 corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable to be in the range of $90 million, with the second quarter costs being higher year-over-year, driven by announced key employee retirement costs. Including the $86 million Russia business sale, operating earnings headwind, comparable operating earnings should increase nearly $200 million and full year 2023 comparable D&A will likely be in the range of $550 million. As we look forward and incorporating near-term demand trends, year-end 2023 net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to trend in the range of 3.7 times, and in future years, we will drive that lower. Last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend, and as Dan mentioned, reducing leverage is our key focus prior to resuming share repurchases in 2024. Rest assured, as fellow owners, we will manage the business through the lens of EVA and cash stewardship and we will effectively manage our supply chain and customers in this current economic climate to secure the best cash, earnings and EVA outcome for our shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Scott. Given the economic environment and global dynamics impacting our world, it’s a great time for investors to get up to speed on Ball. Our significantly improved plan following a challenging 2022 is kicking in. We produce products that consumers use daily, we deliver unique technologies to analyze, observe and defend what we value most, and employee owners are showcasing incredible resiliency, while delivering earnings, free cash flow and high quality innovative solutions to our customers and consumers, and as leverage comes down and free cash flow expands, our return of value to shareholders will grow in 2024 and beyond. Thank you to everyone listening today. And with that, Tina, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Operator. Dan, maybe you can just start off with how the volume outlook by region has changed relative to your forecast three months ago. I mean, clearly, a lot has changed in the last few weeks, months, consumer spending in certain regions including the U.K., seem to be much weaker. So just curious as to how that’s impacted your thought process for the year?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Thanks, Ghansham. I guess, where we are at today, it’s been largely in line the first quarter and even what we are anticipating in the second quarter. Things that have moved around in regions have been largely related to customer mix. So the industry writ large -- is largely in line. There’s been movement in quarters, some have benefited, some haven’t. We have done a little better than the market in Europe, we were a little behind in South America and we were a little behind in North America. The benefits of what we saw in terms of the things within our control, we outperformed almost in every spin category, operational efficiency category. So that all helped us to effectively manage our earnings profile in the first quarter. We came into the year with a conservative view on things like promotional activity in the first half. We believe that you will see some benefits in the second half from that. But, again, we haven’t seen it and we are not counting on a lot of it. We put in place a very conservative volume plan at the outset of the year to underpin our earnings and our cash generation and that’s what our focus is. So we will continue to focus there. I don’t know if that helps you, but we are not seeing a lot of difference. We are seeing some movements and some share shifts by customer and by category. But it’s largely in line with what we anticipated heading into the year, at least for what we know in the first half. In the second half, I think this business, as you know, requires volume. We are a volume business. So we will need a little bit of that uptick in the second half of the year, but we got a lot of things breaking our way and the things that we can control that will enable us to hold the cash and hold the earnings profile here for the majority of the year.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Perfect. And then just so I understand this correctly. So you are benefiting from inflation recovery this year versus last year, right?
Dan Fisher: Correct.
Ghansham Panjabi: Maybe you can touch on where you are seeing -- how inflation is tracking this year, 2023 versus 2022, and if there is any element of deflation, would that mean that in 2024 you would pass it on to your customers, just to clarify.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I will take a shot at it. Just at a high level, we are definitely seeing some improved inflation in terms of the run rate and the cost structure, and to your point, the way these contracts work. Keep in mind that the majority of our PPI benefit, specifically in North America, isn’t going to come into the second half of the year. That will carry forward until it laps into the second half of next year. We will maintain the overwhelming majority of the lift that we are seeing on all of these inflationary pass-throughs as catch-ups. There will be a limited -- right now as we are looking at the year-over-year components, it doesn’t look like there will be much movement one way or another, absent what we are counting on for the catch-up from 2022 into 2023, but this is -- this will be evolving throughout the year depending on where the headwinds or tailwinds on inflation manifest. Scott, anything?
Scott Morrison: No. There’s not deflation typically built in our contracts. There might be something unique in certain contracts where it’s tied to maybe an energy index somewhere. But, in general, we are not seeing deflation, we are seeing inflation slow down and that’s…
Ghansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Scott Morrison: That’s usually a really good environment for us. D Yeah.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yeah. Understood. Understood. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is John [ph] on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question.
Dan Fisher: Hi, John.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you expand on the promotion -- hi. Can you expand on the promotional trends that you are seeing around the globe, particularly in North America? And then also, can you please break down the various categories that you expect to drive growth going forward? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Sure. Promotional activity is really a thing in North America specifically, given the pantry stuffing effects in the larger case packs. We are not seeing much of any right now. I think it’s reflected in the performance of our customers in terms of the revenue growth they are seeing and volume being flattish and so we are sort of tied to that volume being flattish component. Where you would -- the one thing that is clear in the last 12 months to 18 months is the folks that have taken less price versus inflation or have held pricing. They are the ones growing share. And as share becomes more important, which we believe as the year moves on, there will be an opportunity for folks. If they are more focused on share gain, then you will see more activity, and I would expect to see, given the performance of beer with large being down, they have more impetus in a need to push volume than what I am seeing out of the energy and the non-alcohol spaces. So I anticipate a little bit in the second half of the year across the Board, but I don’t anticipate much. And if there’s one area where you could see or anticipate some, it will probably be in the area of the alcohol categories, in beer specifically, because shares don’t make us down in that category.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you so much. I will turn it over.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the detail.
Dan Fisher: Hi, George.
Scott Morrison: Hi, George.
George Staphos: How are you doing?
Dan Fisher: Good.
George Staphos: So I wanted to come back to the question on end markets and trends you would expect for the rest of the year to the extent that you can comment. One, are there any categories without giving away information as proprietary that you expect will be particularly helpful and particularly a headwind to your volume outlook for the rest of the year? Relatedly, you mentioned, Dan, the beer category and there’s been lots of news there. What are you seeing in terms of your relative share of beer relative to what is happening to perhaps your mix or your customer mix? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.
Dan Fisher: Sure. Let me take the second part of the beer question first. As you know, George, you have been following us a long time. We have an overweight in beer and we love all our beer customers and we serve that market. So net-net-net and I know the specifics and I am not going to go into the specifics relative to customers. But I will tell you this, how you should look at Ball’s portfolio as it relates to beer is, we win when folks drink beer. And so if there’s a mix impact. We may have a -- we may have one customer that’s up, in a short period of time there may be a share shift, we pick up both sides of that equation generally. So what we are more interested in is the health of the entire category and we believe that beer is going to need to galvanize itself and push in the second half of the year. They are going to have to promote across the entirety of the industry.
George Staphos: And on the end market trends and it’s been a long earnings season, so we are trying to help you…
Dan Fisher: Yeah. And in the…
George Staphos: …ask them later this weekend but…
Dan Fisher: In the category space, I don’t anticipate any significant wins or significant losses by category. What I -- in my prior answer to the prior question, I will reiterate. I think, there will be a share shift that happens in each category, depending on the approach that each brand owner takes and so folks that have decided to not pass on price increases aggressively, if you will, have done better on share gain over the last 12 months to 18 months. So if they have taken a posture where they are going to pass-through a portion, but not pass-through what everybody else in the category is Zoom, they are the ones that are winning share and so depending on what decision you are making within the category, I think it’s going to be a share shift within the category. I think every category is going to do well and some will do a little better than others, but it’s really going to be the customers that win within categories. That will be the determining factor on our volume versus our competitor’s volume.
Scott Morrison: George, the only thing I would add is, long-term, the positive -- the best positive here is the can is winning, new product introductions are still heavily weighted to cans and so that bodes well for the can in the long run and that’s we are playing a long game here.
George Staphos: Understood. Two questions and I will turn it over. One, on aerospace, can you talk to the degree that you can sustain the performance that you saw in 1Q, after what was -- obviously a little bit of a challenging 2022, whether this is kind of a one-off one quarter hit or benefit or you think you can maintain that into the rest of the year and hopefully 2024? And then back to beverage cans and capacity, can you talk to what you think operating rates will be this year? And Scott, should we really be expecting CapEx in 2024 in the range of $550 million to $600 million based on what you said on D&A? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thank you. So aerospace, I think the way you think about aerospace is that, I wouldn’t do a run rate on sequential improvement, meaning quarter two being better than quarter one. But I would say the quarters year-over-year will be improved. There is real underlying improvement in performance. In the second half of last year we had some pretty significant supply chain disruption. So that has been fixed. And then what you saw in the first quarter was a really nice performance execution and a couple of nice breaks in terms of just efficiency gains and just a better run enterprise there in the first quarter. So I think that will continue to be a tailwind in each quarter. It just -- it won’t be sequential lifts, right, it will be dependent on the projects and the mix. But that business is poised to do have an exceptional year this year. And I will let Scott tackle the efficiency question.
Scott Morrison: Sure, George. On the D&A, I said GAAP D&A for CapEx.
George Staphos: Okay.
Scott Morrison: Not the comparable operating earning ones.
George Staphos: Okay. Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And operating rates this year?
Scott Morrison: Operating rates, we are running our plants. I mean we are taking downtime and we are taking more of it in the second quarter to make sure that we are operating at pretty high levels of above 90%. So we will take downtime in Q2 in North America and South America. South America, that’s pretty typical given the seasonality of that business, but we are really focused in Q2 on getting our inventories to the right level and so we can run it -- and run at fairly high operating rates for the year and so that will be a bit -- that will be a drag in Q2.
George Staphos: Understood. Thank you, guys.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Angel Castillo of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Angel Castillo: Hey. Sorry. Can you hear me?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Hi, Angel.
Angel Castillo: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary around downtime in 2Q. Could you quantify what the drag will be from that and kind of related as you think about the kind of -- just cost or operational leverage that your business has to volumes potentially improving as kind of promotional activity returns. Just could you talk about maybe the degree to which some of that is maybe variable and comes back as you bring assets back online versus how much is just operating leverage that would be upside to our volume?
Dan Fisher: Sure. Well, first of all, congratulations on being a new dad and how quickly…
Angel Castillo: Thanks.
Dan Fisher: I don’t know how quickly Leella can start drinking out of cans. That will help to answer the -- I think, the downtime question. But, in all seriousness, Scott laid it out really well. So in South America, you are entering in the off-peak season. So you typically do curtail. The balance of this comment about curtail there is curtailment and its maintenance. So it’s plant maintenance. So you are going to have that for certain. And then in North America, our plants performed extraordinarily well in Q1 and volumes were a little down versus our expectation. So we carried in a little bit more inventory in the second quarter and we are going to manage that, we are going to manage that tightly here for the balance of the year for cash-generative purposes. We have got a lot of flexibility in our lines, as you know. The curtailment question for us is harder to answer. Angela, I think you know this about us, because we have multiple can sizes on every line. There is one can size that certainly has excess capacity, writ large in the North and Central American market. We do have exposure to that, but it’s limited. And so the next question, I think, that you were leaning into is there, depending on what the brand is or the product is that’s innovating and that’s winning, we can flex to that, and we can turn that on. We are in a really healthy position in terms of safety stock and we are in a healthy position in terms of we are performing a heck of a lot better than we have in the last couple of years in running our business. So if things suddenly shift, we have got dry powder and we have got dry powder in a number of can sizes that gives us flexibility to move into whatever the winning product and whatever the winning brand is going to be. So I am not concerned about us stepping into upside. I -- and we are going to manage inventory positions and safety stock levels really with a lot of discipline here in the second quarter.
Scott Morrison: And Angel, just to give more granularity in the prepared comments, I said, in North America, we would essentially be flat sequentially first quarter to second quarter given the downtime of things that we are going to do and getting our inventories right. In South America, the negative will be larger than that. Given the volume, the mix and the absorption, it will be softer than it was in Q1 and then we expect to be in a better position as we move into the busier second half of the year.
Angel Castillo: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe following up on the strength in the other segment. I am curious, you talked about corporate, you reiterated the guidance there. Just maybe some of the other pieces, some of the strength you are seeing in aerospace and just what the underlying expectations for that segment will be kind of for the full year?
Dan Fisher: Our aerosol business is doing really well. We continue to win business. We continue to have nice volume growth. That business is seeing -- during COVID it was really impacted, I would say, volumes globally and we are seeing that really come back nicely. We are seeing -- and new products and innovation is driving a lot of that, both kind of in the typical aerosol personal care space, but also in the water space and the refill and reusable side. And in aerospace, I think, somebody mentioned, we had a choppy year last year. We had supply chain challenges that cost us money. And the business is performing exceptionally well. They are stepping into these newer contracts that we were confident would be good and they are good, and we will see the benefits of that for the full year. So we are really excited about those businesses.
Angel Castillo: Thank you, Dan. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Cleve Rueckert of UBS. Please go ahead.
Cleve Rueckert: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Cleve Rueckert: A couple of quick follow-ups from me. I am just curious, just digging into the inventories a little bit. I am just curious where inventories both from a finished product and raw material standpoint, where they stand versus your target, I guess, as of the end of the quarter? And if you were building inventories or if you are starting to work them down at this point?
Dan Fisher: Well, we are working -- in North America and in South America, we are working them down. So that’s why you see a big swing in payables. We are not ordering as much metal, both finished goods and coil, raw material. And so we have got another quarter of that to do in Q2 and then we think we will be in a much better position from an inventory standpoint. In Europe, it’s not -- we are turning on a couple of plants, so it’s a very different dynamic there. But in North America and South America, it’s about getting our inventories down.
Cleve Rueckert: Right. And is that more on the raw material side? I mean you mentioned coil, is finished product inventories…
Dan Fisher: It’s both. Yeah.
Cleve Rueckert: Yeah.
Dan Fisher: It’s both. I mean and we are talking…
Cleve Rueckert: Okay.
Dan Fisher: In North America we are talking days of finished good inventory. But we -- a lot of this -- the raw material piece is still a bit of an overhang from last year, because we were bringing in a lot and anticipating growth at this time last year. So we have held on to larger raw material stores and we have been working that off. We are continuing to work that off. And the finished goods, it’s not significantly different than what we anticipated heading into the year. But a few days of additional curtailment is meaningful in a quarter and I think that’s what Scott’s signaling to you.
Cleve Rueckert: Yeah. Yeah. I think that’s very clear. And then just like a quick follow-up. Did you import any cans into North America in the first quarter?
Dan Fisher: No.
Cleve Rueckert: Okay. That’s very clear. And then…
Dan Fisher: Yeah.
Cleve Rueckert: …one last one from me. On the promotional activity...
Dan Fisher: Sorry. Maybe -- one -- maybe this will help for further Q&A regarding that question. We didn’t last year either. So there was a 21 to 22 bridge at each quarter for that. But we have originated all that production last year and you won’t have any of that commentary. For North America specifically, we did have a little bit of Saudi into Europe last year and that’s now gone away and we have got origination production now in Europe.
Cleve Rueckert: Okay. And then just the last one for me is on promotional activity and I appreciate the conservative tone that you are taking and the plan. But just when do you expect to gain visibility, I mean, is there still at this point in the year, the potential for promotional activity to pick up and have a material impact on volumes?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I mean, absolutely, I mean, promotion works really well for us from a volume perspective. The degree to which the promotion is, I think, is the big question. And we are really not trying to avoid this question. But I think here’s the backdrop that we are facing relative to going into much detail or fully understanding the real impacts of what a promotion would look like and how it would react consistent with kind of historical norms. If you look at a 12-pack of CSD cans, three years ago it was about $4 on average, today it’s $8. So is $1 off going to move it? Is $2 off going to move it? So it’s not just promotion. It’s the elasticity in and around the price of the promotion that is very difficult for us to characterize and I think it’s difficult even for our customers probably to understand. So at this point, we need to plan to deliver cash and deliver earnings and the end consumer strength or weakness is also something that’s very difficult to understand right now just given the stimulus packages and higher interest rates and all of those things. It’s just -- it’s ambiguous and difficult to quantify right now. So we are running for cash and we are managing what’s in front of us and until something changes substantively, I think, that’s the best tone for our corporation and our employees to manage to.
Cleve Rueckert: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Good luck with it all. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.
Bryan Burgmeier: Good morning. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier filling in…
Dan Fisher: Hi, Bryan.
Bryan Burgmeier: …for Anthony. Thanks for taking the questions.
Dan Fisher: You bet.
Bryan Burgmeier: Yeah. So the $28 million tailwind from the power agreement settlement in 1Q, was that part of full year guidance originally? I don’t remember hearing that on the 4Q earnings call. And when you talk about North America being kind of flat quarter-to-quarter, I assume this means it will actually be like an apples-to-apples basis, because I don’t expect this tailwind to repeat in 2Q, is that accurate?
Dan Fisher: You are correct. It will be up year-over-year, but flat with the first quarter. In terms of the virtual power purchase agreement and when we had our previous call, we were negotiating the settlement of it. So we weren’t really going to discuss it. Part of that was built into our first quarter numbers because we knew we were going to settle it, we just didn’t know what the amount would be and that amount would have run through our P&L over time and in last year. But the provider wanted to exit the contract and we were able to extract a very favorable outcome for us and all of that outcome hit us -- benefited us in the first quarter, but that will not repeat. We have entered into other virtual power purchase agreements to make up for the lost clean energy that we were buying and so we are in a pretty good spot.
Bryan Burgmeier: Okay. Understood. Thank you for the detail. And last question for me in March, you announced you were having some discussions about the possible closure of the Wallkill plant. I am just wondering how are those discussions going and based on what you know right now, what you can say right now, is it possible to say when or if that plant will close?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I would say in terms of filling out your model, I wouldn’t count on anything in 2023 relative to an uptick in fixed cost savings. We said we were entertaining closing it. I think we are committed to closing that facility now. That’s a subtle change. And the other thing is there’s just not a lot to talk about at this point, because we are entering into effects bargaining now. As we know more, we will update you. But you will see capacity coming out at some point this year and you will see that tailwind in 2024 is what I would anticipate, but I don’t know the specifics of it at this time.
Bryan Burgmeier: Okay yeah. Thanks a lot for detail there.
Dan Fisher: You bet.
Bryan Burgmeier: Good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess, first off, in North Central America -- in the Americas region or North Central America, you were able to kind of hit very high levels of segment income in Q1 that I thought would be more likely to materialize in Q2. So just wondering now as you look into Q2, do you expect kind of flat performance there? And maybe you could comment also on Brazil, obviously, we have seen some inroads on the glass side. But what are your expectations, I guess, as far as substrate mix as you look into Brazil for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: Yeah. I’d say North and Central America, what you are seeing is, all the hard work from last year in terms of cost-out, you see our SG&A is much lower, the plants are operating better. We are -- I think we are getting our group back with how we operate. So it performed at or above our expectations, too. We expected softer volume and our game plan is to perform very well even if volumes are soft and so that’s exactly what you are seeing. You also got -- we got a benefit of that virtual power purchase agreement in the first quarter that won’t repeat and so -- but we will keep earnings relatively flat and that’s due to improved performance across the business.
Dan Fisher: In terms of the glass versus aluminum substrate penetration or shift that we have seen here in the last 12 months to 18 months, it’s in line with what’s happened historically. In a higher inflationary environment, you do see a return to returnable glass, somewhere in that 5% to 6%, 7% share shift. That’s what we saw last year. As Scott indicated in his comments at the outset, and I think, we characterized what we believe to in the second half, as inflation dissipates and some of the actual cost and hedge positions of our customers down in Brazil, allow them to step into what the true cost of aluminum are. We are anticipating a strong peak season that will show up in the second half of Q3 and Q4 for us. We are not hearing anything different. I will actually be down in South America next week. So I anticipate to hear more of the same. But that -- I don’t see it as a permanent shift, I guess, would be the answer if that’s the underlying question there.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up on Europe, I guess, was there any work done on your side to renegotiate contracts for energy or any other cost items? Is there any requirement -- extra work you have to do on that side or not necessarily?
Scott Morrison: A lot of that was already done. The European business has done a really good job both on the commercial front and the supply chain front to manage our costs. So that’s -- and you are seeing that in their performance, too.
Dan Fisher: I think both in that business and equally excellent job by our aerosol business, which has a significant present in Europe. So both of those businesses and both of those management teams have done an extraordinary job to work as partners with our customers to get to a good medium and longer term outcome as we manage through a very different energy and inflationary backdrop in Europe. So I think we have done the right thing by our customers and our teams have done the right thing by our stakeholders.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks a lot.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. The next question comes from Mike Roxland of Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Roxland: Thank you. Hi, Dan, Scott, and congrats on a…
Dan Fisher: Hi, Mike.
Mike Roxland: … solid quarter given the results there. Just some quick ones for me. Just in terms of the guide the EBITDA for North America and particularly exports in 2Q, what type of volume growth is that embedded? Is that -- does that embed a slightly down you expect for the year, and if so, could there be upside to the forecast if you do have to start to see some promotional activity kicking off?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. You were a bit choppy there. But I think the question is kind of what’s the underlying demand profile or assumption built into our current North America projection. And you are correct, we believe it will be slightly down at this point as we look out over the course and the balance of the year, given really very little insight into the actual decision for process related to pricing and volume. It’s a volume business at the end of the day and we are going to need some. But the teams -- we are -- all of the cost actions we took, all of the fixed cost actions that we took as difficult as those were, all of those give us the ability to execute against our earnings and our cash profile more importantly based on kind of a flat to slightly down volume profile and that’s what we currently anticipate and that’s what’s in our model. Second half weighted in terms of things like the PPI pass-through mechanisms and even some additional cost savings that we anticipate in the second half of the year. But, yes, second half weighted plan, whether volume moves meaningfully off of our current run rate, that would be upside, correct, and we would -- yeah, we look forward to seeing that upside. We can step into it, as I commented earlier in the call on both safety stock and our operational and performance. So there’s room for upside, but we need to see that the end consumer health and pricing behavior will play a role and a significant role in that.
Mike Roxland: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up in terms of South America and you mentioned Dan being a little bit behind the market. Was part of that being behind the market due to the bankruptcy of a large beer producer down there? And then if you were behind the market, just any updated thoughts on the plants that you have idled in Brazil, like, Frutas and others and whether they can ultimately become permanent closures?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. We -- the only permanent closures we have had, we have announced. So we have got dry powder in that marketplace. Some of these assets are being contemplated to open back up depending on what happens in the market, as you indicated. There was share shift in Q1 and there was one -- one of our competitors benefited, because they had outweighted exposure to one of the beer brands there. A weaker beer customer or beer mix may shift around as it does from time to time. We believe that the customer relationships that we have, they are excited about the second half of the year more so for the cost shift and their hedges rolling off and us being able to step into our aluminum profile. But, yeah, it was a little choppier because of customer mix for us in the first quarter.
Scott Morrison: We didn’t have any exposure to the customer that went bankrupt.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Very clear. Good luck in 2Q.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Congrats on a solid quarter and a pretty tough demand environment. I guess…
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Phil Ng: … Dan, it would be helpful. Dan, I think, it would be helpful to kind of give us some color in terms of how intra-quarter volume trends kind of sell throughout North America and Central America. How April is kind of shaping up and do you kind of expecting -- expect more of the same effectively in 2Q in terms of the volume trends?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Thanks for the question -- I do. In fact, it’s probably a little softer than Q1, but that’s anticipated and we are managing against that. But, yeah, as we sit here today, there’s not a lot of movement by the customer base to shift what’s currently happening. April is usually not the month that you usually see activity. So you get to the second half of May and June, that becomes really important as you head in the peak season. But as we sit here today, I think, the way you characterize it is correct. It’s largely in line with Q1 and pockets depending on customer mix may be a bit softer.
Phil Ng: Got you. And then for Latin America, Central America, Latin America, you are expecting…
Dan Fisher: Yeah.
Phil Ng: If I heard you correctly, Dan, mid-single-digit growth. So that would imply a pretty sizable ramp in the back half. Part of this, it sounds like it’s predicated on the view that maybe your customers lean into loan hedges rolling off. How much line of sight do you have? I mean like just like promotions in North America, it’s been tough to predict. How much line of sight do you have that your customers would behave as such and will help you kind of jump start that demand backdrop, because it’s been pretty choppy in Brazil?
Dan Fisher: No. I think it’s a great question and it is. We built our plan on it second half loaded because of everything that you just outlined and indicated. The conversations that we are having with our customers, I will be down there next week has all been. You should count on that. That’s what they are planning for. But plans aren’t absolute. So at this point, I haven’t heard anything, I don’t have any insight that would suggest anything other than what we have laid out, what we have characterized. But I think your point is valid, I mean, there’s certainly risk in a significantly elevated volume position. But our contracts also have backstop provisions in there that give us a little bit more teeth than maybe in years past.
Phil Ng: Okay. And sorry, just to sneak one more in. North America, you are expecting volumes to be flat to down a little bit. Any color on the back half what that assumes, is it more like flat, is it still down a little bit or maybe inflect a little bit up in the back half of North America?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. It’s -- right now, I would -- how we get there is slight declines in the first half and flattish in the back half.
Phil Ng: Okay.
Dan Fisher: I think there’s opportunity for more to have in the back half, but that’s not what’s built in our current plan.
Phil Ng: Okay. I think that’s more than reasonable. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dan Fisher: Hi.
Mike Leithead: I just wanted to actually follow up on Phil’s last question there, just thinking about the North America earnings cadence for the year. I think, Scott, you were fairly clear on the 2Q outlook. So just how should we think about the magnitude of the second half step-up just as you think about the new contracts rolling in?
Scott Morrison: Well, we get more of the PPI in the back half of the year, and let’s face it, the Q4 comp was pretty easy for last year. So we should do meaningfully better than Q4 of last year, which was not very good. But I would say, we had a pretty good third quarter last year really in terms of performance in North America. So it’s definitely back half weighted with most of it in the fourth quarter.
Mike Leithead: Got it. Fair enough. And then second briefly, you talked a lot about North America and South America earnings outlook, but could you maybe speak to the earnings outlook for EMEA into the second quarter and beyond?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. Europe is really -- we have got the headwind of Russia. So that was $32 million in the first quarter. It’s $40 million in the second quarter. It moderates to $14 million in the third quarter. So you have got those -- that headwind each of the next couple of quarters, second quarter being the largest headwind, because Russia performed really well last year in 2022. But all of the things that they have been doing from a cost standpoint, from a contract standpoint, from an inflation pass-through standpoint have been positive and they are seeing nice volume and we have got new plants coming up. So we feel really good about the European business for the full year.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I think how you look at Europe is FX stabilized, inflation stabilized, big headwind first half of the year in terms of operating earnings from the divestment of Russia and then you step into the two new facilities in the second half of the year and we are still seeing growth in that business on improved contractual terms. So it will be continued improved performance once you step out of the second quarter with the drag from a $40 million Q2 in Russia.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle White, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kyle White: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on beverage can new product introduction, a lot of uncertainty in the economy, consumers also kind of pulling back a little bit on the spend. Are you seeing any reduction in new product offerings or introductions from your customers, understanding that the can obviously win a greater share of this, but some of these new products in energy alcoholic and ready-to-drink space have been key to the growth. So just curious what you are seeing there?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Kyle, first of all, congratulations. A lot of the information we are getting on new product innovation is coming from Vane [ph], your new baby girl -- boy, sorry.
Kyle White: Yeah. Thank you. No worries.
Dan Fisher: So, yeah, he -- I am sure what he’s going to be wanting is ready-to-drink cocktails and -- but nutritional energy drinks. In all seriousness, lots of innovation still happening and continuing to see share gains from our ready-to-drink cocktails. I think a couple of customers have really benefited in that space. And there’s almost a forcing mechanism here, like, if beer is declining, those alcohol companies or new beverage companies are going to have to step into things to sell and they are innovating at the fastest rate. And then we have seen some of the historical CSD companies that have introduced alcoholic beverage and they have really done well. So you will also see -- the other part of this is you are -- there’s a greater opening as the price increases have been the lever with which folks have pulled, our customers have pulled. It creates a disruptive space for innovation to come in. That’s always what we have seen and so it’s ripe for more innovation and more disruption and you are starting to see that. And now that we have cans available, cans will win and those tailwinds will manifest here more in the medium-term, but we are having all those conversations. So I think that will continue to be a benefit and a tailwind for the can. Still seeing new product introductions at those 70%-plus levels. So nothing’s changed in terms of that. The can continues to win. So we are excited about the future prospects and new product introductions.
Scott Morrison: And in fact, Kyle, today, we have one of the leading beverage innovation houses is actually visiting us here in Colorado today. So we are really excited to be working with them and all kinds of folks with new ideas and new beverage categories.
Kyle White: Got it. And I appreciate the remarks. Maybe a soft sell-through here for the little guy here shortly. But next question I want to focus on the start-ups related to Europe. Just curious how the U.K. and the Czech Republic plant are doing, any kind of -- how the ramp-up there is going and any start-up costs to call out?
Dan Fisher: I will leave it to Scott. I don’t think anything meaningful in the start-up cost. But they are right on track. The teams have done a great job. We have got sister plant concepts in terms of training. So we brought folks in. They are helping us out in the other local facilities. So they will be well trained and ready to step in on day one when we have production and operation.
Scott Morrison: We probably had about $5 million of cost -- start-up cost in the first quarter. There will be more of that in the second quarter. But I was just looking last night actually at the start-up curve for each of those plants and it’s been phenomenally well executed. We are right on where we thought we would be and we are really happy with the performance and the execution of those projects.
Kyle White: Thank you. Appreciate the details.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gabe Hajde: Dan and Scott, good morning. Congrats.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning. Thanks.
Gabe Hajde: I have a question about sort of just the full year and then the second year or second quarter cadence, excuse me. I feel like there’s a decent amount of noise and sort of just underlying performance having, you talked about a stable business, but North Central America profit being up almost 2x from 4Q and I appreciate that was an odd quarter. But, Scott, the math you gave us on being 3.7 times levered by the end of the year, if I subtract out $750 million of cash plus the $260 million of dividends, that implies 21.50 [ph] of EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about it, and then sequentially, would you expect EBITDA to be up or down relative to the first quarter?
Scott Morrison: For the first side of your question, I would say, you are directionally correct where you are coming out. On the second part and are you speaking to the second quarter EBITDA?
Gabe Hajde: Correct. Like, just looking at...
Scott Morrison: Yeah. Now the second quarter EBITDA will be down and then it will accelerate in the back half of the year. And we explained both -- we got a $40 million drag from Russia. We are getting our inventories right in South America. So we will take absorption hits. We will have negative mix in the second quarter. In the second quarter, in North America, the plants will perform very well and we will make more money than we did last year, but we don’t have the PPA thing that we had in the first quarter. So I think I explained exactly how it should shake out.
Gabe Hajde: Understood. And then, Scott, probably, one for you on the balance sheet and cash flow that you are talking about. Unless my model is wrong, your days payable are at 130, which is pretty good, I mean, I expect you guys wouldn’t want to extend it out that long yourselves. Is there anything that we should be mindful of thinking about that being a potential drag on cash flow in future years? And then I think you have $1 billion of debt due in November, is any change in the potential rate on that included in the $425 million of interest expense? Thank you.
Scott Morrison: No. The rate -- the $425 million is kind of built in with any actions that we would take and when we would take those actions to deal with the maturity in November. We will generate a lot of cash in the back half of the year. So our debt paydown really doesn’t happen. This is kind of the peak leverage right now in kind of April, May timeframe, stays fairly even until through June and then it starts to come down, but most of it will come down in the fourth quarter. So that interest expense assumed kind of anything we might do on the debt front. What was the other part of the question?
Dan Fisher: And I think implied in that statement is, yeah, we recognize that we will be retiring cheaper debt than we would be stepping into…
Scott Morrison: Yeah.
Dan Fisher: … at this point in November and that’s anticipated in Scott’s number.
Scott Morrison: Yeah. And then next year we are going to delever more. I think we can both delever and start buying back some stock next year. But sure in the higher interest rate environment, you probably want a little less debt. The world has started to stabilize, so that’s good. But I am a hell of a lot older than you Gabe, but these rates are still not that scary. I was around when we were doing 8%, 9% debt. So 6% debt is really not -- it’s something we have to deal with, but it’s not something that changes the direction or changes what we are doing.
Gabe Hajde: Right. Understood. Thank you. And then the other question was on the days payable or just working capital in general.
Scott Morrison: Oh! Yeah.
Gabe Hajde: I am seeing days payable 130 days.
Scott Morrison: Yeah. I think we got to manage both the supply side and the customer side from a working capital standpoint and we do that every day. And every new contract negotiation, those are key points. It’s not just about price and volume, terms matter and so we focus on that every day, and we have meetings on cash flow every month. So we are very keen and focused on it. But, yeah, in a higher interest rate environment, anything that has a time element of money is more expensive.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question…
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Gabe.
Operator: … comes from Adam -- oh. Pardon me. Go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Thank you. I said, yeah, one more question and then I appreciate it.
Operator: Okay. It’s Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: Hi. Thank you and I appreciate you all squeezing me -- yeah, squeezing me in.
Dan Fisher: You bet.
Adam Samuelson: There’s a lot of ground covered. Maybe just going back to EMEA. I appreciate the kind of noise on a year-on-year basis with Russia and prior year results. You have disclosed what the non-Russia EBIT was in the prior year. So how do we think about that business on an organic profit or on a like-for-like profit basis progressing over the balance of the year? And as we think about the new capacity in Czech Republic and the U.K. layering in, in the second half kind of the implicit underlying volume growth that carries over into 2024 without broader market kind of expansion?
Scott Morrison: Okay. The game plan really for Europe this year is to be able on a euro basis to replace those Russian earnings that we had for nine months last year. So that -- if we can do that, that’s a hell of an accomplishment, because Russia was a very nice profitable business. And so if they can do that, I think, that’s victory. They have done a great job of managing their cost structure, managing their contracts, managing the supply chain and so we are really happy with the performance of the EMEA business.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I think in the simplest terms, the plan that we have set out this year inclusive of Russia, would be we are going to make significantly more money on less volume and we are going to generate more cash and a lot of that is coming from Europe’s ability to offset the $80 plus million of comparable operating earnings in Europe. So they have got a significant plan for improvement and they are off to a good start executing against that. And they have been the business that has done -- they have done extraordinarily well here since we acquired that business from Rexam. They have continued to deliver against plan and the only time I think we didn’t was when we had a global pandemic. So we are feeling pretty confident in that team’s ability to deliver.
Adam Samuelson: Got it. And the carryover on volume into 2024 from the new facilities?
Dan Fisher: It would be in the range -- on those two facilities in the range of 2 billion units.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. That’s all really helpful color. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Thank you. And I think, with that, we look forward to talking to you here in another quarter. Thanks for everybody’s attention and participation today on the call.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At the start of the presentation, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded Thursday, February 02, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Fisher, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you, Carlos and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. Historical financial results for the divested Russian operations will continue to be reflected in the Beverage Packaging EMEA segment. See Note 1, Business Segment Information, for additional information about the sale agreement and a quarterly breakout of Russia's historical sales and operating earnings. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.  Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll reflect on 2022 briefly and Scott and I will discuss key drivers and financial metrics for 2023, and then we will finish up with closing comments, the outlook and Q&A. Let me begin by thanking our employees and stakeholders for their hard work and support. As I reflect on 2022, I'm struck by the magnitude and pace of change we have navigated. The commitments we are prepared to achieve, and the prompt and decisive actions that were made by our team in a fluid and ever-changing macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. Our full year in fourth quarter comparable net earnings reflect our EMEA, aerospace, and aerosol operations coming in as expected offset by the impact of our Russian business sale, softer volume in North and South America. Planned inventory management impacting fixed cost absorption and the effect of high cost inventory and the timing effect of customer sell group. Global beverage can shipments including Russia increased 0.8% in 2022 and decreased 6.1% in the fourth quarter. Excluding Russia, global beverage shipments increased 2.1% in 2022 and decreased 0.9% in the fourth quarter. North America beverage can segment shipments decreased 0.3% in 2022 and decreased 7.1% in the fourth quarter. EMEA beverage can segment shipments excluding Russia increased 8.6% in 2022 and increased 11% in the fourth quarter. South America beverage can segment shipments decreased 6.3% in 2022 and decreased 4.2% in the fourth quarter. Other non-reportable beverage can shipments increased 48.2% year-to-date and 48.5% in the fourth quarter as a result of continuing to provide support to domestic European customers. Our global extruder aluminum bottle and aerosol business continues to benefit from new refillable, reusable bottle offerings and higher recycled content aluminum bottles for personal care products. Shipments in this segment increase 12% year-to-date and 14.5% in the fourth quarter. And our aerospace team increased their backlog 20% year-over-year. In response to the previously discussed unfavorable swing in beverage can volumes relative to our early 2022 expectations and as a result of our sale of our Russian businesses, we optimized our global cost structure, deferred certain projects, and took actions to right size our North and South American manufacturing plant systems by consolidating high cost less bit facilities into scalable facilities capable of delivering our customers a portfolio of can sizes, enabling category and pack size innovation to our customers in a more agile way moving forward. In EMEA, newly constructed facilities will ramp up during the first half of 2023 and provide much needed cans to our customers across the region. It is also important to celebrate the accomplishments achieved by our team during 2022, including shipping nearly 115 billion innovative aluminum cans, bottles and cups to our customers, delivering numerous environmental space science and defense technologies to study the impact of humans and the environment on our earth. Weather satellites that protect life and property from extreme weather events on orbit defense technologies to ensure the safety of our homeland, the war fighter, and our allies, and deep space marbles like the James Webb Space Telescope to view previously invisible images via the Ball built mirror assembly and optics.  Joining the World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition to lead collaboration across the aluminum industry to prioritize circularity and decarbonize the industry, achieving aluminum stewardship initiative ASI certification across our global footprint, remaining on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index, North America for the ninth year, receiving an A minus in the CDP'S climate change questionnaire in 2022, which recognizes the company's commitment to maintaining best practices in corporate climate citizenship through its net zero carbon emissions commitment, renewable electricity coverage and ongoing assessment of climate related risks and opportunities. Receiving a perfect rating on the human rights campaign's annual corporate equity equality index CEI, receiving a 2022 ranking of 90 on a 100 point scale on the 2022 disability equality index DEI, reflecting the meaningful progress the company has made in creating a workplace that enables employees with differing abilities to support its global mission and being recognized as the 2023 industry leader for the industrial good sector for the just capital and CNBC's just 100 top performing companies on ESG factors, including ethical leadership, cultivating and inclusive workplace, use of sustainable materials and carbon reduction. And our global team supported 2,800 non-profit organizations across 30 countries and contributed 30,000 volunteer hours across our communities. Drive for 10 continues to be our vision. We know who we are, we know what is important, and we know where we're going. Together, Ball will one, execute our strategy of preserving our planet and delivering value by creating circular aluminum packaging solutions for single use, limited use and refill, and providing exquisite environmental space science and defense technologies. Second, we will provide our employees and communities the resources and opportunities to succeed. Third, we will be our customers and suppliers partner of choice to enable organic growth, achieve sustainability goals, drive innovation and technology development. And four, we will be a disciplined capital allocator by unlocking value and efficiencies from existing operations with limited future capital investment. And in doing so, generate free cash flow, grow earnings and EVA dollars, and be good stewards of our cash flow to do leverage and return value to our fellow shareholders. Consistent with our commitment at our Investor Day and on our third quarter earnings call commentary in 2023, we can deliver our goal of 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth, including the Russian business sale headwind. The next quarter will remain choppy as we work through higher cost inventory, complete the optimization of our North and South American manufacturing footprint, ramp up our new Kettering U.K. and Pilsen, Czech Republic plants in EMEA. And last, the previously disclosed 2022 customer contract breach in South America.  We'll benefit from the previously identified and executed SG&A actions while continuing to receive the PPI cost recovery throughout 2023, which overall will lead to a back half weighted year. During the Q&A, Scott and I will strive to provide additional clarity on the external environment and cadence for 2023 based on what we know today. We also continue to reiterate our investor field trip long-term goals for global volume growth, fueled by sustainability driven substrate mix shift, product category impact size innovation. Our global beverage teams have positioned our businesses to deliver the year and with an eye on the future. In 2023, an excluding Russia, we estimate in the range of 4% global volume growth for Ball with North America flat to slightly down, South America volume up mid to high single digits, EMEA volume up high single digits, and our other non-reportable business volumes up mid to high single digits, as new EMEA capacity ramps up and exiting 2023 exports from Saudi Arabia into EMEA wind down. Our global beverage businesses work will be complimented by our aerospace and aerosol businesses continued success. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and everyone listening today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks Dan. Full year 2022 comparable diluted earnings per share were $2.78 versus $3.49 in 2021 and fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.44 versus $0.97 in 2021. Full year sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices and aerospace performance offset by currency translation and inflation in Europe and fourth quarter sales were lower largely due to the sale of our Russian businesses. As Dan mentioned, fourth quarter and to a large extent full year diluted earnings per share reflect higher aluminum aerosol results, lower corporate expense and a lower share count more than offset by higher interest expense, higher comparable effective tax rate, comparable operating earnings declined in North and South America and EMEA attributable to the sale of our Russian business, cost inflation and unfavorable earnings translation. I would like to take the opportunity to proactively address the year-over-year results in our North and Central America segment. 50% of the North and Central America operating earnings decline in the fourth quarter was driven by unfavorable swing in fourth quarter volumes versus 2021. We were up 5% in fourth quarter of 2021 and down 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. And the other 50% reflects the confluence of unfavorable fixed cost absorption that was planned entering the fourth quarter, customer mix and the timing effect of high cost inventory ahead of customer sell-through. This larger than expected headwind is the byproduct of volume declines, aluminum price volatility, and our proactive decision to greatly reduce production to meet current market conditions during the quarter. The segments earnings are anticipated to rebound late in the first half of 2023 as high cost inventory sells-through and volume production stabilizes across the consolidated plant system. And after July, segment earnings will accelerate further as we enter the busy summer selling season and all of the contractual inflation recovery will be effective. As we explained on our third quarter earnings call, during 2021, we ramped up our metal purchases to meet what we expected would be strong 2022 growth in North America. We did this at a time of rising metal prices. And while we are largely protected from metal price changes in our P&L, it does impact the cash flow and the amount of metal payables. Earlier this year or earlier last year, when we saw that volumes would not materialize as expected in 2022, we began to reduce metal purchases. This also coincided with declining metal prices, which reduced the metal payables even further. And again, typically not a material P&L impact due to our inventory hedging. The net result is less billed in the accounts payable than originally planned. The result was a use of over $900 million in working capital for full year 2022. This will normalize in 2023 as both metal prices and our metal take should stabilize. As we sit here today, some key metrics to keep in mind. We ended 2022 in a solid liquidity position with over $500 million in cash and $1.5 billion in committed credit availability. 2023 CapEx will be in the range of $1.2 billion, driven by cash outflows related to prior year's projects. We will generate free cash flow in the range of $750 million in 2023 and initially focused on deleveraging. Our 2023 full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 20% and full year 2023 interest expense will be in the range of $415 million. Full year 2023 corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are expected to be around $90 million. Including the $86 million Russian operating earnings headwind, comparable operating earnings should increase over $200 million in full year 2023, comparable D&A will likely be in the range of $560 million. Recall that in 2022, we returned over $830 million to shareholders. And as we look forward, year-end 2023 net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to trend towards 3.5 times, and we may want to drive it lower. Last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend and an alignment with our Investor Day commentary after we navigate the first half of 2023, we'll address the path to resuming share repurchases. Rest assured, as fellow owners, we will manage the business through the lens of EVA and cash stewardship, and we will effectively manage our supply chain and customers in this current economic climate to secure the best cash, earnings and EVA outcome for our shareholders. We are happy to have 2022 behind us, and I'm excited and optimistic for 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks Scott. We will continue to be agile and decisive in the current environment. We must do what is right to ensure supply/demand balance, foster innovation and stimulate equitable sustainability policy which will further broaden the use of circular aluminum packaging solutions and provide continued fuel for our organic growth. In addition, our aerospace team will continue to partner with our customers to deliver world-class solutions for some of the world's greatest challenges and opportunities. Yes, 2022 was an unprecedented year in Ball's history, and I am encouraged about our ability to deliver the year with an eye on our future. Last week, Scott and I reviewed our 2023 operating plan with the Board and our business' ability to deliver on that plan is on track. We look forward to generating free cash flow achieving our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15%, deleveraging and returning value to shareholders. Thank you to everyone listening today. And with that, Carlos, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details as it going. So, I want to thank you, first of all, for all the details in terms of what you're expecting in terms of performance cadence, particularly within North and Central America. Can you give us a bit more view in terms of what your underlying assumptions are in terms of your volumes as it will progress through the first half, the promotional activity and programs from your customers? What you're seeing in terms of innovation from customers right now? And if you were in our seats, as analysts and investors in your stock and we saw something not materializing or something developed that would undermine your expectations, what would it be?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Thanks George. So, as we sit here today, the volumes in EMEA are in line heading right out of the gate in North and Central America. They're in line. I think we're a little soft right now in South America versus my commentary on where we think the year is going to end up. The biggest element that, I think, misunderstood, George, relative to our expectations on volume and why we're a little bit more bullish is aluminum prices have come off. But that doesn't mean that's necessarily the cost position for our customers. So, as they lap their head positions heading into the second quarter and the second half of the year, with the price increases that have gone into aluminum beverage packaging plus the actual costs coming off, there are significant profit pools that our customers are going to be able to step into. As I said, right out of the gate, we're a heck of a lot closer to what we anticipated in terms of volume. In North America, in particular, given the December falloff on all in consumer products that has changed the behavior patterns initially this year with a lot more price promotion and in cap. Will that continue for the balance of the year, I would suggest it will given the other backdrop that I gave you relative to costs. But the Europe continues to be incredibly strong. North America is off to a good start. I think there's a little bit of a wait and see in terms of the volatility in South America. But having said that, the real cost positions that some of our major customers down there will lap in terms of hedge positions will stimulate optimism in the second half of the year. The PPI, pass-through, we're in good shape. All of the cost actions and the footprint reductions that we've talked about are in good shape. Maybe I'll turn it over to Scott just for some of the positive signs relative to inflation and currency and some of the other things that are starting to move in our direction from a more stable environment. But 2023, as we sit here today, I'm feeling really confident about.
Scott Morrison: I'll touch that and then why don't you touch innovation as part of this question. Yeah. George, I think why we feel optimistic is we are definitely seeing input costs moderate. And whether it's European energy is not going to be as bad as what people predicted. We're largely hedged in Europe, lower than where the spot price is today. That really squeezed us last year. We're getting all the PPI pass-through. We started to see freight rates, warehousing, lots of input cost moderating. And so, as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about kind of the cost input side being in a much more stable place. You kind of had long-term rates kind of peak. Short-term rates are still ticking up a little bit, and so we'll feel that in our interest expense for 2023, but we feel much better. Dan, why don't you talk about the innovation.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Reflecting on your comment and question around innovation. Certainly, in the alcohol space, we continue to see a lot of innovation, which is a good thing because the combination of the innovation. Something is going to win. As we always say, George, we don't know what's going to win, something is going to win, but it also increases the pressure on the beer category to compete. Those two things will equate to improve volume outlook. So, we're helping to fuel the innovation, number one, but we also have a heck of a lot of customers that we sell beer cans. We'll benefit one way or another depending on who wins.
George Staphos: Yeah. We'll be hoping for more consumption during the Super Bowl and other things. My other question, I'll turn it over. Thanks for all the color. So, you talked about reduced CapEx. That's certainly not a surprise, but that also includes your tail on spending for existing plants as they are coming up. I know it's not 2024, but is there a view you can give us on what CapEx might look like or what the delta might look like as we look out to 2024 and 2025. Thank you very much, guys.
Scott Morrison: Sure. Most of the spend this year, George, that 1.2 are things that are already in flight. And as we've talked about we've got -- we'll have enough capital on the ground after completing these couple of things in Europe. We'll be in a pretty good spot. So, I would expect, although it's February 2 of 2023, I would expect in 2024, we'll see that drop further.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. The internal conversation, George, quite candidly, is we've spent the capital we need to grow into over the next two to three years. We could most likely spend at D&A levels in 2024 and 2025. If we have a reason to invest, it will be with a strategic customer, one or two. So, I think you'll start to see a much more disciplined level loaded capital approach relative to D&A spend moving forward.
George Staphos: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Can you just talk a little bit more about North American volumes, specifically how much you believe was more just industry sell-through, specific customer destocking? And anything idiosyncratic to Ball given the shutdown in Phoenix. Just anything to break down those three variables, would be very helpful. Thank you.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think, it was back half of the quarter, and it's no different than probably every other end consumer product in the retail shelves. Customers pushing price, pushed it too far, and there was price elasticity that kicked in. Beer was down the most. And I think what we're seeing is a return to more promotional activity here right out of the gate in Q1. So, I think there's recognition of what happened there in the last four to six weeks of the year, which is well publicized. Since we sell to everyone and every category and every channel, we were impacted by all of that. But I can tell you, there's a different behavioral patterns setting in relative to our customers and their promotional activity. So, I think this will normalize and we'll start to move into a more sustainable underpinning for growth moving forward.
Christopher Parkinson: Got it. And just as a very quick follow-up on some of your Latin American commentary. Could you just very quickly just discuss the market dynamics? Obviously, it was pretty difficult during the first half with Carnival and everything else and then kind of easing that helpful. World Cup rebound, which didn't necessarily materialize. But just given the easy comps on 2022 and your comments on a preliminary basis for the beginning of the January, how do you think you believe the market will ultimately materialize throughout the balance of the year given the low comps just given the industry? And then also any perhaps just very quick comments on market share trends. Thank you so much.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I will point you to the fact that the real cost that our customers have relative to aluminum cans has as much to do with our hedge positions. And in the second half of the year, cans will be the lowest cost substrate with the greatest profit pool, and that will give ample reason for our customers to push aluminum packaging at that point. You're right, the World Cup relative to the fourth quarter. We did see an uptick, but we didn't see the uptick that we anticipated. We knew that early in the quarter and we were reacting to that throughout the quarter. And we've got -- to your point, you got Carnival, you've got another a couple of things. You don't have a COVID environment like you did last year. So, there's optimism. It started off less favorable than we anticipated in South America, but it's only one month in, and I would -- and we're still bullish on things getting better in the back half of the year.
Scott Morrison: I would just add on South America. In the first quarter last year, we will lap the customer breach that we had. So, that will we won't have that volume as we look forward.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you so much.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning.
Daniel Fisher: Sure. Good morning.
Arun Viswanathan: Obviously, we've seen the destocking and some of the impact on the consumer from the inflation. And you mentioned that maybe that's turning a little bit now with the deflation [indiscernible] and customers of yours potentially in a position to promote the product. So, could you describe a little bit more what you're seeing on that front? And if you are seeing that -- do you expect -- what's kind of your growth and volume outlook for NA, North America this year, taking into account some of the closures you had last year as well. Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. As we sit here today, I'm encouraged by what we're seeing, and I'm not willing to come off of -- is certainly in the year that we're planning for flat. We're planning our earnings lift in our 10% to 15% EPS growth, up a flat North America until we're more convinced that the behaviors of the customers will continue to lean into promotion throughout the year. That's where we're landing right now.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Maybe I can ask the question a little differently. If you think about the $400 million or so that you delivered in Q4 EBITDA, maybe there's a little bit of seasonality improvement in Q1 2023. Q4 2023, I imagine, could look like Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 would be up seasonally better. But still, that would fall short of $2 billion of EBITDA. Is that right? I mean, what are some of the levers you guys can pull to maybe get back to that level? Or is that maybe more like a 2024 and 2025 kind of range that we should be thinking about?
Scott Morrison: Right. I think in the first quarter -- remember, a year ago in the first quarter, things were pretty good. Our volumes were up. It looks strong. We're not going to have that kind of...
Daniel Fisher: And then we had Russia.
Scott Morrison: And we had Russia. I mean -- but in North America, the volumes were good. So, we won't have -- we're going to have pretty tough comps in the first quarter. I think as we look forward then in the remaining quarters, we should see nice improvement year-over-year in each of the quarters in North America as we look forward.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, just on Europe, it sounded like Europe, you're somewhat a little bit more constructive on. Could you just describe that? I'm just trying to square that away with some of the inflation that they saw. Last year, you had some energy price inflation that was pretty stiff. So, is that what's also giving you some relief and potentially pushing some volume upside in Europe? Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Well, we had a really strong volume year in Europe, and it wasn't impacted despite the end consumer being impacted with less discretionary spend. The aluminum package did really well. And I think it's more of the aluminum package story and the resiliency of the can in Europe than it is discretionary spending levels that helped us. Your point is valid. So, the way our contracts will work. We'll be able to pass through a lot of the inflationary headwinds that we experienced in 2022, we'll pass that back in 2023. So, if we're -- if inflation moderates, which it has, even if it dissipates a bit, then you've got the underpinnings of volume that continues to grow at a high single digit rate. We've got capacity online -- coming online in two major facilities that will take advantage of that growth. And we should be able to make more money given the stability of the inflation and the fact that we're catching up in arrears on a lot of the inflationary pass-through. We're really excited about Europe for 2023.
Scott Morrison: And just to your comment on EBITDA, I would expect -- I'd be disappointed if we didn't exceed $2 billion of EBITDA in 2023.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Next question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes. Good morning, everybody.
Daniel Fisher: Morning.
Scott Morrison: Morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: So, Dan, just kind of building off your recent comments, you've been quite vocal about how higher beverage price pressure volumes along the supply chain, including at your end. How much do you think volumes were impacted in 2022 just based on the dynamic in Beverage North America? And as it relates to your comment on Europe resilience, was that also boosted in 2022 by just the comparison from the reopening across Europe relative to the prior year? And do you still see sort of that momentum continuing into 2023.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I'm not entirely sure your first question, I could parse out that delta. I will tell you where it had an impact and where we'll be able to point to it is in the fact that it's really the promotional activity during the peak season that we didn't see any of last year. We still grew a little bit. I would probably go back to sort of that 2018, 2019 range of growth that we saw. And I would put that up against what we actually saw in 2022. And I would say that delta, just speaking out loud, is probably what we lost out on because of a lack of promotional activity in the peak season. So, maybe 1% to 2% during that period, which as you know, those -- that last billion cans is kind of where you make your money at the end of the year in a fixed cost business. So, yeah. Let's see. Right now, we're off to a good start relative to how the beer companies are promoting and how our customers are looking at what they need to do from -- elasticity curves have changed here in the last four to six weeks.
Scott Morrison: But I would say in Europe, Ghansham, the sustainability push in Europe is not slowing down. And I think that will help. And we know how many can filling lines are going in Europe in the next couple of years. And so that's why I think we're bullish on the outlook for Europe.
Daniel Fisher: I think the reopening, if anything, would have slowed our growth because the on-premise is overwhelmingly kegs. And so, despite that return to on-prem, we're still growing at the high single-digit rate. So, I continue to be bullish about what's happening in Europe. I've said this -- a number of times, and I think I've said this to you. I'm most bullish on Europe and the medium and the long-term. The short-term, obviously, they have to figure out energy that will impact every industry, every business. But for us, the sustainability underpinnings are tremendous and we're excited about these new assets that we're ramping up here in the first half of the year.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. That's clear. And then for the second question, on the $200 million plus net price cost recovery guidance for 2023, how do you anticipate that will flow through the various beverage can segments? And then separately, did you give a working capital number for 2023 in terms of year-over-year movement?
Scott Morrison: For 2023 working capital, we expect to get to that $750 million of free cash flow. We expect working capital to be a source around a little over $300 million.
Daniel Fisher: And on the net cost pass-through and net recovery, it's overwhelmingly Europe and North America, and it's 60% North America, Scott, as he's nodding. And you'll see, in Europe, it comes in a more linear fashion over the quarters. And in North America, you'll see probably 60% of that coming in, in the second half of the year. July 1 is a big date for lapping one particular customer contract.
Ghansham Panjabi: Fantastic. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Just following up on Ghansham's last question, you reaffirmed the $200 million inflation recovery target. Scott, you mentioned inflation and energy coming in lower than expected, maybe in some cases materially. I'm just wondering if that's something that would cause you to raise that $200 million target or maybe it's too early in the year? Or do you think about sort of the benefits of those lower costs in a different way? Or is there a lag? Just wondering, how we should think about that.
Daniel Fisher: I'll answer it, and then I'll let Scott give you more detailed answer. We prefer to be heroes in December than off start here. But Scott, go ahead.
Scott Morrison: No, what I was going to say. It's only February 2. I mean, I think the optimism we're feeling is that it appears a lot of the trends are more helpful to us. And so, all those things will be beneficial, but we've got to see how volumes show up. That's the big wildcard. We're getting out of the gate in a more positive and constructive way. And we're building our plan on a more conservative basis but we'll see. But definitely, things seem to be turning into a little more tailwinds than headwinds that we had last year.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a few quick follow-ups on Latin America. With the footprint actions in Brazil, I don't know if there's kind of a finer point you can put on the cost savings there. And then maybe just where your operating rates will be in Brazil once that's completed? And I guess just one last one. If -- how you'd characterize the South American businesses ex Brazil, how they're doing?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. They're -- ex Brazil, they're quite resilient even with the inflation levels that you're seeing in Argentina. Our volume was up double-digits in the country year-over-year. So, it's incredibly resilient. Chile is performing well. Paraguay very well. Some of the other areas that we export into continue to perform well despite all of the geopolitical turbulence and the inflationary pressures you see in there, that's holding in, and the team is doing a wonderful job managing all of that -- all of those challenges. In Brazil, it's less about the cost savings relative to the expenditures. Obviously, labor is incredibly cheap there. So, yeah, you shutter a facility, you're not going to see near the savings that you would in Europe or in North America. But operating in a tighter supply/demand environment gives you the ability in your other facilities to keep them full and to run them full out and that generally benefits efficiency levels, reduces spoilage, all of the things that we're asking our plans to do and manage on a day-to-day basis. It gives them a a greater ability to do that, manage their quality aspects, stay in touch with customers, manage their supply chain more effectively. So that's where you see the savings and the benefits and the earnings profile being impacted in South America.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. that’s helpful. I will turn it over.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Adam Samuelson: Good morning. So, I guess, the first question is thinking about the demand side, maybe come back into North America. And Dan, our comments on -- January has had a better start, maybe seeing some pickup in promotional activity. Your comments seem to be a bit more focused on beer as a category versus CSD or elsewhere. And I'd love to just get your perspective on, are you seeing that change in customer behavior and promotional intensity across all categories? Or is it right now exclusive to beer. And corollary to that is, in discussions with customers across different beverage categories, is there any where you're seeing kind of a step-up in innovation and new product introduction that is giving you more optimism.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think it's a really good question. Beer is being more aggressive on the promotional activities because beer had the most precipitive drop-off in volume. So, it correlates and the magnitude of the volume declines in terms of the promotional activity. So, yes, you're seeing it across every single category because every single category was down in the last six weeks of the year. But it's certainly more pronounced, and that's probably a reason bias in my comments are relative to really -- a really nice uplift in beer right out of the gate. Some of it is attributed clearly to the Super Bowl as we're two weeks out. Now, you always see some promotion and some lift there, but it's more pronounced than that from a historical standpoint because of the volume fall off. And on innovation, I made this comment earlier on the question, but maybe I can dive into a little bit more. There's innovation in every category. But the most innovation, and this has been a consistent thematic here with the exception of that accordion effect relative to COVID where there were less SKUs just trying to get cans out the door. But as the large CPGs become beverage companies, they're leaning heavily into alcohol and mixers and those types of cocktails. And that's where innovation is really stemming. And you'll continue to see that for the foreseeable future. And those are most of what we expect to see here in 2023. There are other things obviously being worked all the time that are -- but what I know is planned for retail shelves is going to largely fall into cocktails and innovation and around that for the can.
Adam Samuelson: Got it. And then, I appreciate you gave different segment level detail for the different can business. I'm not sure if I might have missed a view on the aerospace performance for the year and where you think that's tracking?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. So, for 2023, we will be -- we'll exceed 15% earnings growth. Actually, right now, as it's shaken out, we're north of 20%. So, we will see -- we're beginning to step into the backlog that we've won through the years and starting to see repeat builds. Our defense platform is executing really, really well. And I think we've navigated some choppiness in terms of supply chain in 2022 that has stabilized. So, as we sit here today, we should see a much improved operating earnings performance from our aerospace business.
Adam Samuelson: Great. That’s helpful color. That’s all I have. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys.
Daniel Fisher: Hi, Phil.
Phil Ng: Hi, guys. Good morning. Appreciating earnings will be a little tougher in the first quarter and likely down, do you have enough levers where earnings will be up year-over-year in 2Q. And I think you're targeting 10% to 15% earnings growth for 2023. Is that predicated on the 4% volume growth you were mentioning? Or is it more of a flattish backdrop like you previously guided to?
Scott Morrison: I think we'll start to see momentum in the second quarter definitely. And you've got to really -- it depends on volumes. But as things kind of roll in, we get some PPI pickup here in the first quarter, but as Dan mentioned, the bigger chunk of it comes in the second half of the year. First quarter will definitely be softer year-over-year given some of the challenges. And we're still working through some of this inventory, both in North America and in South America. So that's where you'll see most of that impact. But then I would expect in North America, we'll see nice earnings improvement as we get into the second quarter and year-over-year as we look through the rest of the year.
Daniel Fisher: You should see sequential improvement, right, 2Q, Q3, Q4 throughout the year, both with the PPI, the fixed cost savings. And keep in mind, 2Q from a volume standpoint was quite challenged in North America. And so, we get a little modicum of promotional activity there in the peak season then I think our plans, as Scott indicated. They're more on the conservative side. Where we would need volume in order to achieve our plans is Europe, because we are opening up two facilities there. But Europe has been the most resilient and the anchor customers are the most resilient that are going to be the tenants of those facilities.
Phil Ng: But just to be clear guys, to hit your 10% to 15% earnings growth, you need 4% volume growth? Or is it more flat? Because I thought at the Analyst Day, the messaging was more flat, and we still can get to like 10% to 15%.
Daniel Fisher: In North America, it's flat.
Phil Ng: Okay.
Daniel Fisher: Global is 4%, North America, it's flat. Mid- to high single digits in Europe; mid-single digits in South America. That's how we get to the 4%.
Phil Ng: Okay. And then, on Latin America, in general, certainly Brazil has been really choppy and there's certainly some social unrest. What gives you confidence kind of deliver the mid to high single digit growth in 2023? It's just been a pretty tough environment for some time, especially Brazil. Any contractor up renewal in 2023, 2024 in that Brazilian market?
Daniel Fisher: No. We have no open contracts heading into 2023 and 2024. The resiliency relative to South America is going to be the stabilization. First of all, lapping the contract for each in Q1. And then the actual cost position of our customers down there will have the aluminum package being the most cost advantaged product in Brazil, in particular, with that customer base.
Phil Ng: Okay. Appreciate the color, guys.
Operator: Next question from the line of Angel Castillo, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Angel Castillo: Thanks for taking my question. And just a quick little near-term one. It seemed like that you talked about kind of full year volume growth across the different regions. Could you give us a similar walk for what that 1Q number is and how you're kind of thinking about across the regions?
Daniel Fisher: I think 1Q in total will be down. Again, we had pretty good growth in Q1 of 2022. And so, I think we'll be slightly down Q1 in total. Yeah. I'd say in North America, you'll be flat. In South America, you'll be flat because of the customer breach, so we'll be lapping that. Flat would actually be growth on an apples-to-apples basis. So, we could be a little plus, a little minus there, and we'd expect to be that high single digits growth, mid to high single digits for Europe. That will be a linear number throughout the year. It'll -- you'll have more opportunity to grow in the back half because of the two facilities that are coming online, but you should see growth right out of the gate in Europe. And then flattish in the other two regions for the aforementioned customer breach and the market dynamics that exist right now in North America.
Angel Castillo: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just curious, as you think about the ranges that you gave for the full year, I guess, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but South America, Europe and other seem to be a little bit of a wider range, whereas North America flat. I think if I kind of heard it correctly, flat to slightly down. It seems to be a little bit narrower, but this also seems to be an area or the region where we've seen maybe some of the more or bigger deterioration throughout the last few quarters. So, you kind of mentioned liquor and cocktails as one area of potential growth in promotional activity. But how much of this -- I guess, what gives you comfort to have a narrow range there as you think about the year progressing? Is some of that cocktail liquor related volume, the degree of visibility? Is it there? Is things contracted? Like I guess, yeah, I just want to give you comfort in that kind of narrow range.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Well, I mean, flattish. That's not the narrowest range we've ever given, but I appreciate the question. I would say optimism to tighten the range in North America is that we plan on a much more conservative environment. And one thing that I think is important to underpin this business and this industry in particular. We're generally the first to go into the recession and we're generally the first to come out. And what we need is to see what happened over the last four to six weeks was the elasticity curve on volume and price for our customers has been broken. And now you're seeing volume come off. That means you have to return to some level of promotional activity, that's good for the can. So, for North America, in particular, we've got a big business where with all of the customers. It gives us some foothold in understanding the market dynamics. The contracts are secured. We know what we have heading into the year. Could it be up a little, down a little, yes. That's not going to have an impact on whether or not we can deliver our 10% to 15% EPS target.
Scott Morrison: I would also say, I mean, it's -- it's been more volatile in the last few years, no doubt. Historically, North America has been more predictable. South America has always had a wider range just because volumes can move around a lot. Those economies are more volatile. And so, you could see much -- you could see outpace growth at times. And you could see bigger declines at times. So, South America has just always been a more volatile region. And despite to Dan's comments, I mean, you would think with 100% inflation in Argentina that would be a big negative for cans, but cans grew double digits last year. So, it's a little tougher to predict in a place like that.
Angel Castillo: That's very helpful. And if I may just kind of a quick little follow-up on that. I think one of the areas that historically in recession has helped is the customer pays [ph] back maybe how much they're spending on-prem, some of the off-prem starts to revise for cans. And have we seen some of that already? Or is that still a potential upside as we think about the near-term and the customer?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I haven't -- we haven't seen that particularly. But you're exactly right. Those are the early signs and signals that were -- that's when you know you're on the uplift coming out. And we've seen the first stages of promotional activity starting. We haven't seen them steering on-prem versus off-prem. But that usually is the next lever to pull. You're exactly right.
Angel Castillo: Thank you so much.
Operator: Next question from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Roxland: Thanks Dan and Scott. Thanks for taking my questions.
Daniel Fisher: Sure, Mike.
Mike Roxland: Just one quick follow-up on -- Dan mentioned the weakness in beer. And obviously, you experienced it firsthand. You also saw that in the Nielsen data with beer volumes being very challenged late last year. How are you thinking about your exposure to beer at this juncture? Is it still a core end market? And given what's occurred in beer, are there any opportunities for you to diversify your mix?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. There's always an opportunity. We're constantly looking at our portfolio and our customers. And how we look at it, Michael. It's a great question. So, I look at brand owners and brand builders. And the other thing is, we may be talking to or we may be having -- we may have a portfolio of historical beer customers, but those historical beer customers are moving aggressively into other things from an innovation standpoint. So, within the portfolio of some of our customers, we like the fact that they're acquiring products that they're innovating products and that they're pushing new innovations. And so -- you're right. I mean, there is volume ascribed to beer and there's big volume ascribed to beer, and that's always going to be an underpinning of us within a volume business. But as that beer SKUs to other drinks, and other alcohol profiles, it will be a trade-off within their portfolio. We're selling them the cans. The label they want to put on it doesn't matter to us. We just want to be with the winners on the brand side.
Mike Roxland: Got it. That makes sense. And then just quickly, can you comment on any additional portfolio rationalizations or temporary closures and maybe contemplating. I think last quarter, you indicated that you've taken all the actions you needed to with respect to plant closures. But then there was an industry publication came out with some details, I guess, in December about temporary closures in Brazil. I think you highlighted it broadly in your press release as well. So, first question, are those closures in Brazil temporary or permanent? And then second, quickly, just given the volatility in Brazil over time, and certainly worse [ph] in the last few years. Can you walk us through the investment case as to why investing in Brazil makes sense or really doesn't at this point?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. So, I would look at the regions, depending on what's permanent and what's temporary, a lot of times, labor laws dictate that. And I would tell you, in North America and South America, we've always managed our supply chain. So, we'll curtail lines. We'll have temporary shutdowns. That's more reflective of the conditions with which we are managing our South America plant. I think it was mischaracterized as to what we were doing with that. We -- whether we -- it's a temporary closure for now, given the existing conditions and economic conditions in Brazil. It's no different in the analysis, right? It's EVA. We do have a larger risk profile and hurdle rate in places that are more volatile like Brazil. So that's already embedded. So, it's going to be the length of the contract, the substantive nature and the economic underpinnings of that contract and whether or not we believe we can generate EVA. I don't know, Scott, if there's anything to add on Brazil.
Scott Morrison: I mean, Brazil over a long period of time has been a really good place to invest. The can share has grown in all of the markets that we've operated. It does tend to be a more volatile region. And so you have to live with that volatility. But over the long run, it's been a great place to invest and we expect it to be a really good place going forward. It is not without its challenges, but that's part of why you can make some pretty good money there, too.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Thanks for the color and good luck in 2023.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Next question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. Dan and Scott, good morning. Hope you all well.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks. Good morning.
Adam Josephson: Good morning, Dan. Dan, one on back to North America. So, your long-term target is 2% to 4%. Last year, you were down a touch. You're seeing the beer companies promote more. It sounds like you're encouraged about what you're seeing in January, yet you're expecting flattish shipments, so that would be two years in a row of flattish shipments compared to that long-term target of 2% to 4%. I guess, just given the low base, and the promotional activity you're seeing, why are you not expecting more growth in North America, particularly given your long-term target? I'm just trying to understand if there's something I'm missing.
Daniel Fisher: No, I just think it's earlier in the year, Adam. And we've seen a couple of weeks' worth of promotion. That's not enough for us to get overly excited that we'll return to some modicum of growth. And candidly, the inflationary, but all of the things relative to a soft economy are still present. I think the can will do well. I think you'll see trajectory in the second half of the year. That will be helpful with these promotions continue. I'd love to come back to you in six months and say, hey, we're right back on track with the 2% to 4%, but as we sit here today, I don't have enough data points to say that that's going to happen in 2023.
Scott Morrison: But over time, we're still kind of in the post-COVID adjustment period, I think. And 2023 will kind of -- I think 2023 will kind of be the end of that. And I would expect those historical rates that we saw before COVID with sustainability tailwinds and all of those things, those aren't going away. Those are going to continue. And so that's why we think, longer term those growth rates make sense, but we're still kind of in a period where we're getting through COVID and now through rapid inflation. And we're starting to see things settle down and that gives us more optimism, I think.
Adam Josephson: Just one follow-up to that, which is I know you said two plants. I think that was about 8% of your North American capacity middle of last year. So, you were down 0.3%, you're expecting to be flat this year. Do you think the market grew by more than what you were -- did you underperform the market last year and do you expect to underperform the market this year? Can you just give me any sense of how you think you're performing in terms of North American volumes versus the broader market?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think we have -- it's a great question, probably a tick underperformance relative to the market because of the size of our beer portfolio, and that was the most distressed category last year. So that certainly had a knock-on effect. The good news is if that area reverts back to a more positive promotional activity, then we should be the beneficiaries of that shift moving forward.
Scott Morrison: And remember, market -- the impact in the market is going to be dependent on who's bringing up capacity, who's turned on new capacity. In Europe, this year, we'll probably outperform the market, because we have facilities coming online. So, those kind of things can happen quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year. We don't focus on market share, we focus really on, to Dan's point, being with the right customers, the customers that are innovative, the customers that are growing, that are using the can. We focus more on that versus market share.
Adam Josephson: Right. No, I get that. So, if you end up flattish, would it be unreasonable to think that the market would be up 1-ish just using that [indiscernible]?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think that's right. I think that's right, Adam. I think you're thinking about it the right way. Yeah.
Adam Josephson: Okay. Thanks. And Scott, just on the working capital. Can you -- I think Ghansham asked about it that you're expecting $300 million [ph] source. Is that -- can you just help me with where that's coming from, just compared to what you dealt with last year? Is it probably from any particular place in particular, across the board improvements that you're expecting?
Scott Morrison: Mostly inventory, Adam. We still have too much inventory, and that's what we need to work off. So, we've got a lot of cash, if you will, sitting in our inventory. And so, as we roll that off we'll be able to generate a lot of cash from it. That's the biggest chunk.
Adam Josephson: Got it. Thanks. And just beyond that so if that working capital normalizes and the CapEx ends up equivalent to D&A. Are those the -- are there any other swing factors that you would point out as we think about free cash flow beyond 2023, lower CapEx.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. And we've got it.
Adam Josephson: Okay.
Daniel Fisher: We have really good line of sight, Adam, into -- it's both raw material and finished goods. We've got really good line of sight. We're working that every single day right now. So, we're confident about that source of cash this year.
Adam Josephson: Thanks Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Carlos, we'll take one more.
Operator: All right, sir. Last question from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeeze me in here. I just wanted to better understand kind of the bridge to 2023 earnings and I believe the few hundred million improvement in comparable operating earnings that you called out. You have the $200 million of net inflation recovery. You have the $150 million in cost savings, partially offset by, call it, $85 million from the Russia business. But that's still about $250 million to $265 million of improvement before we have any volume growth. I guess what are some of the major headwinds here that I might be missing in the bridge?
Daniel Fisher: And the rise in interest rate -- interest expense?
Kyle White: All right. Got it. And then on the $200 million inflation recovery that you guys talked about, it seems like it's mostly...
Scott Morrison: Going back to your past comments though, our while inflation is moderating, the base cost -- so energy costs in 2023 are going to be higher than they were in 2022. We're just passing them along, but that -- there are things that have -- are built into our plan that are negatives from a cost perspective. And so that's why you got to -- I can't just talk about all the positives, there's always some that go the other way. And so, the balance of those is how I get to my number.
Kyle White: Right. And I guess, I was assuming that the net inflation was trying to net for maybe the incremental inflation that you're seeing, but maybe that's not the right way to look at it.
Scott Morrison: It's really the net of what we expect.
Kyle White: Okay.
Scott Morrison: But that again that's just inflation, right?
Kyle White: Yeah. Makes sense. Sticking on that point. So, it seems like a large portion of that recovery, the $200 million inflation recovery is in North America, but it doesn't happen just given the contractual time until July.
Scott Morrison: Correct.
Kyle White: I know it's early days. But you have a sense…
Scott Morrison: Yeah. 60% of it is in North America, the other 40% is in Europe. Yeah.
Kyle White: Okay. I appreciate that. That's very helpful. Do you -- I know it's early days, but do you have a sense of how much of that benefit could actually continue to flow into 2024 in North America?
Scott Morrison: It stays. It doesn't go back the other way, it stays.
Kyle White: Right. I am just asking…
Scott Morrison: The perfect scenario for us is you get a pretty sizable PPI increase and your costs actually go down.
Daniel Fisher: Effectively, what would happen to your question, you're thinking about it the right way. So, you pass-through inflation a year in arrears. If inflation moderates or dissipates, you hold on to that margin expansion for the following year. It was just the opposite of that the past two years for us. But if things come up in energy prices, et cetera, et cetera, come up after we put through the existing cost, then that would be carried into parts of 2024. You're right.
Kyle White: Got it. Sounds good. Well, everything looks much better from a price cost standpoint going into this year versus the challenging last year. So, good luck with the balance of the year.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you very much.
Scott Morrison: I was glad to be done with 2022 and excited about 2023.
End of Q&A:
Daniel Fisher: Well said, Carlos, with that, we'll close the call and look forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter. We are excited for 2023. And we've got the teams and the plans in place to execute. So, we'll be following up and iterating on those plans as we look forward to the next time we get together. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation 3Q 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 3, 2022. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Dan Fisher, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2022 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. Historical financial results for the divested Russian operations will continue to be reflected in the Beverage Packaging EMEA segment. See Note 1, Business Segment Information, for additional information about the sale agreement and a quarterly breakout of Russia's historical sales and operating earnings. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some brief business performance commentary. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. Let me begin by thanking those of you who attended our Biennial Investor Field Trip in late September. It was great spending time with many of you in-person. We sincerely appreciate you taking time to meet our team to listen to Ball's unwavering strategy for our agile aluminum packaging portfolio and our aerospace technology security, science and sustainability solutions; to learn from our continued transparency on macroeconomic dynamics, impacting our industry; and to engage with us on the actions we have taken to deliver improved results, cash generation and EVA in 2023 and beyond. For those of you that could not attend a transcript of the management briefing and slides as well as contact information for our Investor Relations team are available on ball.com/investors under the Presentations tab. In Q3, we have successfully divested the Russian beverage can business, executed on our previously disclosed company-wide cost-out plan; further oriented our business plan to serve our customers' needs from an optimized, lower-cost footprint and reported our third quarter results. Scott and I will strive to provide additional clarity on the 2022 baseline, and bridge to 2023 based on what we know today in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our year-to-date and third quarter comparable net earnings reflect resilient global demand for our products, offset by the historic rise in inflation and interest rates and headwinds associated with the sale of our Russian operations and earnings translation. Relative to resilient trends – excuse me, relative to resilient demand trends and to be efficient with our business commentary, here is a summary of our year-to-date and third quarter global and regional shipments. Global beverage can shipments, excluding Russia, increased 3.1% year-to-date and 5.7% in the third quarter. North America beverage can segment shipments increased 1.9% year-to-date and 2.5% in the third quarter. EMEA beverage can segment shipments, excluding Russia, increased 7.8% year-to-date and 8.3% in the third quarter. South America beverage can segment shipments decreased 7.2% year-to-date and increased 5.2% in the third quarter. And with the continuing support of EMEA demand, our other non-reportable beverage can shipments increased 48.1% year-to-date and 46.7% in the third quarter. Our global extruded aluminum bottle and aerosol business continues to benefit from new refillable, reusable bottle offerings, including our recent alliance with Boomerang and other water brands and higher recycled content aluminum bottles for personal care products. Shipments in this segment increased 11.2% year-to-date and 12.2% in the third quarter. Other recent activities include our global beverage business continuing construction on two facilities in EMEA; our North American team successfully completing effects bargaining associated with our August announcement to permanently cease production in our Phoenix, Arizona and St. Paul, Minnesota facilities in fourth quarter 2022 and first quarter of 2023, respectively. Our aluminum cups team introducing 9-ounce and 12-ounce cup sizes at retail and in stadium venues. Our aerospace team delivering solid program execution; a robust backlog of $3 billion and won-not-booked backlog of $4.6 billion; and the scheduled mid-November launch of the Ball-built Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite instrument aboard the joint NASA and NOAA, JPSS-2 Earth observation satellite. And on the sustainability and community front, favorable substrate mix shift is continuing across Ball's aluminum product businesses. Our aluminum aerosol facilities achieved ASI certification, and our Velim, Czech Republic plant received an award from the Red Cross, recognizing their response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. Thank you again to our employees across the globe for supporting their communities and each other. In summary, our customers continue to lean on aluminum as their package of choice. We also reiterate our Investor Day global volume growth opportunity. Near-term volumes may be pressured in certain regions as everyday consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation. Our global beverage teams have positioned their businesses for slower growth in the fourth quarter, inclusive of preparing for temporary actions to achieve year-end inventory goals, keeping supply/demand tight and preparing for optimal financial improvement in 2023. Our global beverage businesses work will be complemented by our aerospace and aerosol businesses' continued success. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Year-to-date 2022 comparable diluted earnings per share were $2.34 versus $2.52 in 2021, and third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.75 versus $0.94 in 2021. Year-to-date and third quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher volumes with improved price mix and higher aerospace performance, partially offset by currency translation and inflation in Europe. Comparable year-to-date and third quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in North America and aerospace, and a lower share count, offset by higher interest expense, higher comparable effective tax rate, comparable operating earnings declines in EMEA attributable to the sale of our Russian business, cost inflation and unfavorable earnings translation and lower comparable operating earnings in South America continued to be driven by regional customer mix. I'd like to take the opportunity to proactively address working capital and why cash flow will be better next year. During 2021, we ramped up our metal purchases to meet what we expected would be strong 2022 growth in North America. We did this at a time of rising metal prices. And while we are protected for metal price changes in our P&L due to our effective inventory hedging program, it does impact the cash flow and the amount of metal payables. Earlier this year when we saw the vibes would not materialize as expected in 2022, we began to reduce metal purchases. This also coincided with declining metal prices, which reduced the metal payables even further. Again, no P&L impact due to Ball's effective inventory hedging. The net result is less billed in the accounts payable than originally planned. The end result will be a use of around $800 million in working capital for full year 2022. This will normalize next year as both metal prices and our take should stabilize. We are focusing our attention on generating cash as we move forward. Other reasons why cash flow will be better next year include $500 million less in CapEx. The expectation of meaningfully less pension contributions needed, $90 million less in cash outflow for incentive compensation due to lower incentive comp payments from 2022 and we'll have much less working capital pressure and also increasing our focus on selling terms. I will give you more direction during our fourth quarter earnings call once all of our planning is complete. As we sit here today and following the completion of our Russian business sale, some key metrics to keep in mind for 2022. We ended the quarter in a solid liquidity position with $500 million in cash and $1.5 billion in committed credit availability. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 20%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $315 million and full year corporate undistributed costs in other non-reportable are still expected to be slightly above a $100 million.  CapEx will finish the year in the range of $1.7 billion. Given year-to-date results in the key metrics cited Q4 shipment trends, estimated inflation and euro translation headwinds and including the sale of our Russian business, we will likely end the year with operating earnings in the range of 8% less than last year's, full year 2021 comparable earnings of $1.585 billion. And full year 2022 comparable D&A likely to be in the range of $540 million. As a result, yearend net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to remain at current levels, which is higher than where we would like it to be and we are have prioritized debt reduction in the near term as we move into 2023. Last week, Ball declared its quarterly cash dividend and in alignment with our Investor Day commentary after we navigate fourth quarter and early 2023, we'll address the path to resuming share repurchases. Rest assured, as fellow owners, we will manage the business through the lens of EVA and cash stewardship and we'll effectively manage our supply chain and customers in this current economic climate to secure the best cash earnings and EVA outcome for our shareholders. I'm looking forward to exiting 2022 and I'm excited for 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to you Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Scott. I appreciate your help as always. And my best Scott Morrison impersonation minus the expletives, the world is in a really challenged state, but we're not geopolitical unrest rapidly changing business conditions and unprecedented macroeconomic trends are unsettling. Here is what I know. During 2022 and since assuming the role of CEO, we have endeavored to be transparent and decisive. In doing so, it has led to an uncomfortable, yet necessary set of actions, which have impacted colleagues and communities. Yes, 2022 has been an unprecedented time and at Ball we are going forward with what we know, our Drive for 10 strategy and EVA discipline. In addition, our well capitalized footprint is serving resilient demand for our products and technologies. We will benefit from contractual pass through of inflationary costs, the cost out actions already implemented or nearing completion, a more conservative short term view of volume growth, the focus on cash, and we have the best team to navigate, change, unlock value and beyond 2022, achieve our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15%, inclusive of the divested Russian operating earnings headwind. Thank you to everyone listening today and with that we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Thank you very much. Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and for taking my questions. I guess you've given us some of the outlook for fourth quarter Scott, and we appreciate that. Trying to adjust for Russia in Europe, should we expect more or less the same type of year-on-year trajectory across the other segments? How should we consider whatever sort of inventory reduction you may need to see? And how that'll hit the segments, we would guess it'd be North American in particular. If you had a couple of quick thoughts there. And then I a couple of followings after that.
Scott Morrison: Yes, I think most of the inventory, kind of the absorption hit will take on will be in North America as we adjust inventories down. Through nine months we saw North American can shipments increase just under 2%, kind of full year, we think it's going to be flattish. In Europe, Russia will be the big drag taking out roughly $30 million of earnings; inflation is a bit higher in Europe than – we'll see a comparable inflation impact in fourth quarter as we did in third quarter, which is about $10 million. And we've got some start-up costs too as we ramp up Kettering and the Czech Republic. So that will be a bit of a drag. When we look at – aerospace had an incredible fourth quarter last year that won't repeat. It would be more normalized this year. And then in South America we're not quite seeing the bump from World Cup that we had expected. And so I think they will finish the year. We thought we could get back to even, and that probably won't be the case when we look at South American volumes.
George Staphos: Thanks for that Scott. Second question I had for you is, is there any update on the net commercial and price cost outlook that you initially relate to us at the Analyst Day as you look to 2023? Has anything moved of significance that you would want to relay as we're again trying to build and bridge to 2023 off the 2022 base that you've given us?
Scott Morrison: Sure. I think we're having the most progress in Europe for 2023. The team has done a remarkable job, they have been doing that since the outset of the year. Obviously inflation has continued to go up, George.
George Staphos: Yes.
Scott Morrison: But we continue to go back and continue to work those. So I think we're in a really good spot to not only benefit from our contractual pass through that's already built in to our contracts that have the most meaningful impact obviously in Europe, western Europe, and in North America. And on an ongoing basis, I think, you are hearing this from other participants in the industry if there are things that are extraordinary in the contract, especially from a supply chain standpoint, those are going to have to be passed through immediately. And so that's the stance we will be taking moving forward. We're not going to continue to chase inflation of an extraordinary nature, specifically Europe energy prices.
George Staphos: Okay. So maybe Dan, I recognize it's tough to say on a live mic, but should we assume those pluses and minuses are kind of balancing and therefore the outlook you gave us remains the outlook into 2023 on that front?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think, that's exactly right, George.
George Staphos: Okay. 
Dan Fisher: I think as we sit here today, and Scott will give more context to this, we're steering based on the baseline we just gave you on 2022 to the high end of our 10% to 15% for next year as we sit here today.
George Staphos: Okay. Thanks for that. And then my last one, you talk about a near term more conservative view on growth. And looking back over the last four or five quarters and as you are hearing from your customers going forward, what are they saying about their volume expectations into 2023 and maybe a little bit past that? And what are they saying in terms of cans relative to some of the new growth initiatives that are out there, whether it's non alcoholics or ready to drink? And then in turn, how are you, for lack of a better term, haircutting that commentary in terms of your growth outlook, not just near-term, not just fourth quarter, but playing with real capital dollars over the next two, three years? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
Scott Morrison: Thanks. Yes.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thanks, George. I think it’s a good news, bad news story for North America. I mean the reality is what we’re seeing, and I’ll give you the most recent data that we have, kind of the prior 12 weeks. Total consumption is down – total literage consumption is down in the U.S. The good news is that when we look at that relative to the can, the can is significantly stronger than tetra glass and plastic combined. So our declines are muted compared to what everyone else is experiencing in terms of substrate mix. The areas that continue to grow, it’s probably easier to talk about what’s still growing, and we have nice exposure to those areas. Our energy is continuing to grow in the prior 12 weeks. Import beer continues to grow, cider, F&Bs continue to grow, and craft beer is flat. Everything else is a modicum of decline. And if I were to bracket the two big buckets right now, this is just can volume. Non-alcoholic, down about 1%; and total alcohol, down a couple percent. You can double and triple those declines for the other packages and substrate mix. So feeling really bullish about the circularity story for the long-term. But inflation is clearly hitting the end consumer right now. And that is absolutely in our thinking. And Scott, maybe you want to talk just at a high level in terms of 2023 and some of the higher-level assumptions you have. But the one thing I will say that gives me room for optimism is we are a recession-proof business, a resistant business. What we’ve been experiencing is inflation. As we transition into the recession piece, there’s a very good likelihood that the can starts to get promoted. And I think with higher credit card, interest rate increases on folks that have interest-only mortgages, that will – and that’s what we’ve heard from our customers. They said, at some point, the can will get promoted. But as long as the elasticity curve remained somewhat strong with the price increases, that’s what we’ve experienced to date. And I think we’re kind of on the precipice here, George. We’re not counting on upside, but we’re right on the precipice of seeing a decline, and that decline manifesting potentially in a better outlook for cans.
Scott Morrison: Yes. I would just add, George, I have a real sense of optimism as we move forward from where we’re at right now. Last quarter, you probably could hear the challenges and the tough actions we needed to take in my voice. Well, we’ve done all those. We’ve taken the actions on plant closures. We’ve produced SG&A meaningfully. We’re scrutinizing all of our investments to a greater degree as we move forward. And all of these actions will help us ensure that we have improved results in 2023 in a more – off a more modest base of growth that we’re expecting. So we see nice improvement across all of our business units moving into next year. The contractual pass-throughs on inflation will help, and the cost-out actions will definitely help. So as we sit here today, I feel really good about us moving into 2023.
George Staphos: Thank you very much, guys. Good luck.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Adam Samuelson: So want to continue on the discussion on North America and demand. And you just gave some comments on promotions, and that’s obviously being important into 2023. I guess given the capacity actions that you’ve taken, but also maybe the capacity utilization that you didn’t fully take advantage of earlier in the year in your own system. Just to clarify, do you – can Ball North America can shipments be up in 2023 from where you sit today?
Dan Fisher: Oh, yes. Yes, we have ample dry powder. Keep in mind, the big investments that we’ve made, we’re still on the journey of increasing the efficiency curve and the start-up range. And so yes, we can grow mid-single digits here for the next couple of years in North America without any additional investments.
Scott Morrison: We’re just building a plan that’s more conservative, and we’ll have the ability to toggle up if our customers need that demand.
Adam Samuelson: Just are you actually planning to be your shipments to be up mid-single digits next year? Or that’s what you have the capability for? I just want to clarify that point.
Scott Morrison: No. That’s what we have the capability for. We’re planning for flattish to slight growth.
Adam Samuelson: Got it. Okay. That’s really helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up in Europe. Obviously, there’s a lot of noise in the accounting with Russia, but we stripped that out. Where do you think you are today on price discussions with customers and recouping some of the energy and other inflation that you’ve been absorbing and kind of visibility that, that can maybe potentially flip to a tailwind at some point in 2023?
Scott Morrison: Yes. Well, on energy specifically, we’re in a pretty good spot. We’ve got 95% of the energy that we can hedge has been hedged. So while energy will go up next year, we feel like we’re in a pretty good position to control how much it goes up, and we’re having active dialogue with our customers on that front of them absorbing those costs because we’re not going to absorb them.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. Great. That’s all. Really helpful. I’ll pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey guys, good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Good morning. I guess, first off, on your comments on metal sourcing in 2021. For 2022, obviously, prices have changed between then and now. Did you secure that additional metal specifically for customers based on contracts? Because I’m trying to understand why customers would pay you yesterday’s prices in context of lower prices today for metal.
Scott Morrison: No. We hedge – so we hedge our inventory, Ghansham. So we don’t take P&L hit. So we bring in inventory with an expectation of when it gets sold, and we hedge that price risk. So it’s not – that’s why it’s not showing up in our P&L. It’s just really a cash flow hit.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got it. And you said, just to clarify, $800 million hit in terms of working capital year-over-year for 2022? And then if so, what is the base-case expectation for free cash flow this year? And what kind of reversal could we see next year on working capital?
Scott Morrison: No. Well, I mean, if you take $800 million use of working capital and the CapEx we’re spending, we’ll have – it will be – we’ll have negative free cash flow of over $1 billion. Next year, we expect the working capital element to be greatly reduced. And we expect – that what’s where I was talking, we’re going to reduce our CapEx. We have reduced incentive comp payments that go out next year. We have – we don’t need to fund our pension plans. Our pensions are in really good shape. So there’s a bunch of other elements of cash flow that we’ll be able to generate next year versus what we experienced this year. And we’ll have more earnings.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes. Good point. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. First question, I just wanted to ask about Europe or EMEA. Obviously, you guys are still posting pretty strong growth there. Relatedly, I would think the inflation pain there for the consumer is much worse just given where the economy is. So can you maybe just talk through kind of what you’re seeing there, and maybe some of the resilience relative to the inflation paying that?
Dan Fisher: Yes. One of the things that we’ve seen, I commented earlier in the call, but we have seen a shift from on-prem to off-prem, which has benefited the can. So they’re – the end consumer is – absolutely, their energy bills and their homes, right, are impacting their discretionary spend. And they are already making choices. The areas of strength continue to be beer and continue to be energy drinks, which we have a really nice portfolio there. So we may be benefiting a little bit from mix. But the end consumer has been quite resilient to this point. We are seeing the beginnings of shifts, but those shifts are manifesting in more resiliency and more of a shift toward the can. Obviously, I think the anecdotes I can bring you from Europe are folks aren’t as concerned about this winter as they are about next winter with the natural gas reserves. We’ll see how that manifests in terms of additional inflationary pressure moving forward.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. And then just briefly, Scott, I just wanted to clarify on your cash flow answer to Ghansham just now. I know it’s hard to – who knows where metal prices will be next year. But just as we sit here today, this year, we’re going to have an $800 million hit to cash from working capital. Should working capital be a source of cash? And roughly, how much do you think you could get back next year, as all else equal?
Scott Morrison: Well, we actually – if you go back to 2021, we had a big source. So it started in 2021, and we got the benefit of bringing in more metal and the metal payables being higher in 2021. So we saw that benefit in 2021. We’re giving that back essentially in 2022. So that’s why, I think next year, we’re not going to build a plan based upon that much volume growth. So we won’t – our metal shipments will be more measurable, if you will, more controllable. And so we don’t expect this kind of swing from a working capital standpoint. We see it much more balanced…
Mike Leithead: Fair enough. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Just to circle back on your – the plan – the initial planning for 2023, you just hit on Europe and hit on some comments in North America. What about just Latin America just given, obviously, some of the headwinds that were incurred during the first half of the year, the World Cup being in the fourth quarter, a normalized Carnival and some like a more customer-specific issues? So if you could just hit on that – the region holistically, it would be very helpful. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Sure. I think, as Scott already indicated, if you’re thinking about sort of high-level volume assumptions as we sit here today, we’re thinking flattish in North and Central America. We think we’ll be in that kind of 4% to 6% range in both South America and in Europe. South America, keep in mind that we walked from a major customer in the beginning of 2021. And so our comps begin to be much easier, if you will, relative to that dislocation in – excuse me, in 2022, they become – we lapse that in Q1 of 2023. So a like-for-like business, we should be growing in that 4% to 6%. And we don’t anticipate any more customer dislocations heading into that – the year. Brazil beer consumption has continued to get better throughout the year. The can is continuing to win. And I think what you’ll see is a much more stable South America region in general, with the exception of Argentina is always a wildcard. So we expect a modicum of growth everywhere inclusive of Brazil heading into next year.
Christopher Parkinson: Got it. And just given all the noise and the kind of the puts and takes on some of the various substrates and demand categories, could you just comment on your overall wins in terms of aluminum cans for new launches? I mean, is that still relatively in line with what you’ve been discussing over the last few analyst days? Just – and specifically, if you could hit it on plastic and containerboard, that would be quite helpful. Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Yes. So a real quick trip around the world. The can is – we have – we’re underpenetrated in Europe, the lowest substrate penetration of the three big regions with the most regulation mounting in Central and Western Europe here heading into 2025 with some producer responsibility bills. The most pent-up demand in terms of new can filling lines is in Europe because of those regulations and because of the steer toward aluminum. In South America, we’re still winning. Ex-Brazil, there’s still a huge shift from returnable glass into aluminum, and aluminum continues to win. And in North America, the new product introductions are still coming out in cans. The thing that’s muting that, as I said earlier in the call, is overall consumption is down. And so that’s really the biggest issue relative to – there’s nothing that’s changed in our circularity story or the fundamentals underlying our belief in the medium to long-term. But the inflation has caught up to the end consumer, and we’re seeing less consumption across the board in North America.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you very much.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Roxland of Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Roxland: Thank, Dan, Scott and appreciate the questions. Just – first off, just you mentioned, Dan, that shipments grew 2.5% in North and Central America. Is there any way to parse that between the two regions? And really, what I’m – yes. So between – like what did North America grow in 3Q versus Central America? And the reason I’m asking is because you just bear in your commentary, you mentioned slower beer demand. I think some of your peers have called that out as well. And some of the beer companies themselves in their earnings calls have noted volume weakness given consumer inflation. So given that beer is a pretty important end market for you in North America, just trying to figure out what North America did standalone versus the combined North and Central America?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think overall, similar level of resiliency in both. The things that were advantaged for us are probably our energy mix in our portfolio, which is stronger; our import beer mix in our portfolio, which is probably stronger. So those are the two things that have given us some underpinnings. And our strategic partners in both the non-alcohol space and the alcohol space are winning. So those three things have given us probably a modicum of growth that’s in line or a little ahead of what the industry has. Not a great deal of difference between North America and Mexico, Central America.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just wanted to get your perspective on what you think it’s going to take ultimately for the industry to have better volumes. Is it matter – is it just a matter of the fillers and beverage companies realizing they need to drive increased throughput, as you mentioned earlier? Is it a matter of just ultimately seeing payer inflation that should drive better – hopefully, drive better consumer spending? What do you think ultimately gets you over the hump despite seeing those better volumes?
Dan Fisher: Yes. It’s a great question. Again, when I look at the substrate mix, the can is winning, the problem is overall literage is declining. So there is clearly pressure on the end consumer relative to inflation, credit card debt, raising interest rates. There has to be some level of stability in the economy. And then I think we transition back to what we saw prior to the heightened inflation pressures. It is true that when we’ve entered recessions historically, the can has been promoted because there has been a shift from on-prem into more off-prem. And we haven’t seen that yet. So I think there’s been a lot of pent-up enthusiasm because we haven’t been able to go out over the last couple of years that people are spending their money, and they’re in the on-premise channel. That feels as if it’s beginning to shift and the most recent data here in the one and the four-week data. That will help the can, but fundamentally, I think a return to a normalized inflation and interest rate environment provides consumer confidence, and then the can wins on the circularity notes.
Scott Morrison: I think also the thing that will help is aluminum is off almost $2,000 from its high. And so while all the – while most input costs for our customers are going up, the reality is the actual aluminum has gone down. And so that gives them the ability – they took a lot of price this past year, and that gives them the ability to do a little more price promotion and not give up margin because aluminum has come down so much. So, I think that’s a positive.
Mike Roxland: Got it. No, thank you. That’s very helpful. Good luck for the balance of the year.
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey guys. Scott, at your Investor Day, I think you called out about $200 million of net pricing benefit, which accounts for inflation from some of the PPI escalators. Is that still a good way to think about it just because inflation is obviously pretty dynamic here? And I think, Dan, you mentioned how you’re making pretty good progress on renegotiating pricing and trying to recoup some of the inflation you’re seeing in Europe. Any color on how much of an uplift that could be next year?
Scott Morrison: Well, I think on the PPI faster, I think it’s going to be greater than $200 million across all the different segments, because inflation has run pretty hot this year. We’re starting to see input inflation moderate, which would be helpful. So, we should get a lift on the pass-through to kind of catch up some of the pain we’ve had to feel. This year, it’s been mostly in Europe with energy and inflation. Last year, it was North America. So, I think we feel pretty good about those contracts work. We did get the price pass-through in North America and in Europe that we expected this year. The problem is we offset in Europe by currency and by more inflation. We’ll get a lot of that inflation back next year.
Dan Fisher: The $200 million, Phil – the $200 million is really not mutually exclusive to the ongoing conversations we’re having with our customers. Those ongoing conversations, I’d look at it this way. If we continue to see surprises in terms of increased inflation, especially in energy with surcharges coming from our supply base, those will be passed through directly. And we weren’t behaving in that manner here over the last 18 months to 24 months. So, what I envision is the number that Scott gave you, we’re able to hold to that number next year as opposed to seeing it potentially being eroded like it was this year.
Phil Ng: Okay. But the right way to think about it, Dan, would be the $200 million plus, any incremental good work you’re doing on renegotiating stuff in Europe, right? So – and that accounts for the inflation you’re seeing today, correct?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I would say the ongoing work with customer contracts enables us to see the $200 million flow-through, not have it be muted like it was this year.
Phil Ng: Okay. $200 million is still a good way to think about it. That’s great. And then throughout the supply chain, there’s obviously been pretty meaningful destocking. And some of your peers have called that out. They saw a big drop-off in September. So from what you can tell based on order trends into October, November, your customer base, do you have a sense that, Dan, if that’s largely flushed out at this point? And then, Scott, I think you were calling about – calling out potentially curtailing production in the fourth quarter to kind of flush out your inventory. Should we assume that it’s going to be largely behind you? Or there’s going to be some hangover effect starting next year from an earnings perspective as you kind of work that down?
Scott Morrison: No. Our plan is to take – to get our inventories in line by the end of this year so that we go into next year in a cleaner, more balanced position, so not to have the impact next year.
Phil Ng: Okay. On the customer level?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think what we’re seeing right now, Phil, is the end consumer is consuming less. And so I think that is – I understand the question in and around destocking. I do think that a lot of those filled goods are now out in retail and they’re being promo-ed. What we need is for the end consumer to start picking up the pace of consumption on the can and for those promos to continue, and then it turns into a positive. We haven’t seen that yet.
Phil Ng: Okay. And just one last one for me. Remind us how the promotion cycle usually works in North America. I believe it’s heavier during the summertime. So if your customers do come back and want to step up promotional activity to kind of drive demand in North America, when would the earliest pocket be?
Dan Fisher: You see a small amount for the Super Bowl, a real small amount. And then you see Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day. And two weeks prior to each one of those events is when you typically see it. And if you get lucky, you might get some around the holiday period, which – we’re not planning on that thinking – yes, you got it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Angel Castillo of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Angel Castillo: Hi thanks for taking my question. I just was hoping we could unpack fourth quarter a little bit better. I guess just want to make sure I’m understanding correctly. So the bridge that was given for operating income seems to suggest, and correct me if I’m wrong, roughly kind of $307 million for the quarter. Could you just give us a sense for how you’re thinking about that by the kind of segments and regions? And also included in that, what your volume expectations are embedded within that?
Scott Morrison: I’m sorry, what was the number you gave me?
Angel Castillo: $307 million. I just basically took 8% off of the [indiscernible] and then less what you’ve done year-to-date?
Scott Morrison: Oh, okay. Yes. I mean the things I mentioned were absorption in North America and lower volumes than last year. We had a tough comp from last year. We grew 5% last year. We’ve grown 2% year-to-date through nine months. We expect that to be flattish for the year. South America, we had the loss of the customer from last year. That will be a bit of a drag. Europe, obviously, we sold our Russia business. That generated – would have generated in the – it will be in the Q. It’s in the press release, about $30 million of profitability in the fourth quarter. Inflation is running kind of similar to where it was in the third quarter, which is about a $10 million drag, and we’ll have some start-up costs related to our new facilities. Beverage packaging others should still be strong as we continue to import into Europe to meet demand. And our aerospace business had a record fourth quarter last year, which likely won’t repeat. So, I think your – where you’re landing is directionally correct.
Angel Castillo: And then I just wanted to also revisit the prior question on destocking a little bit more. So, I guess there was a couple of customers that may be mentioned some potential kind of pull-forward ahead of pricing initiatives in October. So, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of what you’ve seen from a September standpoint in terms of shipments in North America and whether there was any kind of pull-forward that you kind of anticipate to be unwinding in the fourth quarter?
Scott Morrison: No. We didn’t see any of that in September. What we’re seeing through the last four weeks, in particular, is further in consumer decline in the overall beverage consumption. So, we didn’t feel the impacts of a September pull-forward. And we’re monitoring very closely the promotional activity here in the fourth quarter, because as the end consumers stop buying beverages across the board in any setting and if there’s a shift from on-prem to off-prem they can typically will be promoted more and there will be reason for upset. We have not seem that through the first four weeks of the quarter.
Angel Castillo: Thank you.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari for Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Hi. Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Just wondering equity earnings I think were negative in the quarter after being up I think mid-single digits in 1Q and 2Q. Can you just give some color on what drove that, and maybe just remind us what's in that line after the Metalpack sale?
Scott Morrison: Yes. We had unusually some kind of one-time good guys in the second quarter and then those kind of reversed in the third quarter. So we'll get – we'll have more normalized equity earnings as we look to the fourth quarter. And the things that are in there are mainly are JVs with Rocky Mountain Metal Container, Guatemala and Vietnam.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's...
Scott Morrison: That was kind of spread across those three basically.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And then the $150 million in fixed and variable cost reductions that you outlined for 2023, I'm just wondering if there's any finer point you can put around maybe the cadence of that kind of savings flow through and just generally when we think about kind of quarterly comps next year and obviously a lot of moving pieces, any reason why you'd expect earnings growth might be more first half weighted or second half weighted just overall thoughts there?
Scott Morrison: I mean, it should come relatively evenly, but we won't get all of the benefit in the first quarters. As Dan mentioned one of the plant closures doesn't happen until the first quarter and some of the folks that are departing won't depart until the first quarter. So we'll start to see more of that benefit kind of Q2 going forward, but it should run relatively evenly.
Dan Fisher: And was your question specific to the $150 million or were you looking for phasing of earnings?
Anthony Pettinari: I guess both. I mean the $150 million makes sense, but yes.
Dan Fisher: Yes. So the inflation pass through mechanism, the net 200 that Scott talked about that will come through in contractual chunks. So January 1st you'll have some, April 1st you'll have some, July 1st you'll have some, and then we will have an FX drag of $15 million to $20 million mostly in the first four to five months of the year.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's super helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes in Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please go ahead
Unidentified Analyst: Dan, its Scott. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions, I appreciate it.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Just one clarification just on the full year guidance. So I think, Scott, you said North America's shipments flattish for the year; forgive me if I missed this. Does that imply about down five to six in the fourth quarter, and if so is that about consistent with what you see in thus far in October?
Scott Morrison: No, I don't think it'll be down that much.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Closer to 4-ish, I guess, okay.
Scott Morrison: Not down that much. I mean we could play that game, but I don't think it'll be down that much.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Just because I know 4Q is typically a lighter quarter volume wise, so...
Scott Morrison: We had a really good quarter last year. We grew like 5% last year; it's not going to grow like that.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And if I think about just flattish shipments this year and then similar next year, can you just compare that to '09, I think organically you were down a bit because I think you bought the four plants from AB InBev. If memory serves such that shipments were down a bit organically. Dan, could you just compare what you're expecting this year and next to what you saw in '09? I know you said the one difference is that there's a lot more inflation now than was the case then or any other differences that you would point to now versus then?
Scott Morrison: Yes. In '09 we were actually up a couple percent and at that's after being down in '08 like 5%. So usually, I mean in my 2022 years here if you get a short-term hit on volumes, it comes back pretty quickly, I mean, the can is pretty resilient. To Dan's point on all the benefits that the can has none of that has changed and so you might see things in a particular quarter given pressures on the consumer or pricing actions on the customer, those things tend to balance out over time. And so I think we're in that period right now where it is more – a little more uncertain, a little more volatile, but we still believe in our customers still believe, which is even more important in the benefits of the can. And so we feel really good about as we get into – this year's definitely been choppier and we feel really good about moving into 2023.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think, Adam, your question is a really good one in that. What we've talked about in the question that you're posing really has to do with the recession. Well it really hasn't – we haven't really had it. We haven't been in a recession. We've had inflation and interest rates rising, and we've got customers that haven't really lost volume on the top line and so they've continued to leverage the price mechanism. If we shift into a recession that's when the cans resiliency shows up. It doesn't necessarily show up in 50-year inflationary times depending on the promotional activity and the pricing from our customers. So there's – I do what you may be hearing a little bit more optimistic tone from Scott and I because I think we're heading there and in consumer's behavioral patterns and what we're seeing in the data is they will prefer the can in that environment.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. No, understood. And I appreciate that Dan, and it just, one other one along similar lines with the benefit of hindsight growth shot up in 2019 with sparkling water and then hard seltzer and that was the one, it was the biggest growth year in a very long time for the industry and then the pandemic hit and that kind of skewed everything and it was unclear how much was specific to beverage cans, how much was the pandemic inflating demand for everything. And we've seen that deflate now. So with the benefit of hindsight, how much of the, the growth over the past call three years would you attribute to the pandemic versus growth in hard seltzer or sparkling water, et cetera? And how is that informing your view of what you think the long-term rate of growth is?
Dan Fisher: I can remember in our 2018 Investor Day, Adam that we talked about the growth then, we were already starting to see it in 2018. So it was well before the pandemic. It wasn't just 2019. So we started to see the growth, we started to see really the sustainability stories start playing out in North America. And you had new product introductions went from 30% five years before to 70% at that time in 2018. Now we're seeing it even higher and so definitely there was some distortions because of COVID and there's some distortions like unwinding COVID, but that, and now we've got inflation and some other things to deal with. But that's where I think long-term all the benefits of the can still exist. And so that's why we feel very confident and very comfortable about how we're moving forward into 2023.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Adam, I think at a really high level we're paying attention to a basket of countries like the U.S. that pushed significant stimulus into their economies. And if you go back a handful of years, we talked about this in the Investor Day. I mean, there's been 20 billion to 25 billion of additional cans added to the U.S. market over about a three to four year period. That can volume isn't going backwards. So it's there now what's the growth rate on top of that is a very fair question. We believe because of the circularity story because this volume has stuck that we're poised for really nice lift kind of in that medium and long-term range, but we just need a modicum of stability in the economy. And we've seen that in places like Chili was up 25% in 2021, they haven't gone backwards. So they’ve maintained that can penetration on the shelves. And I think the underpinnings of the circularity story are the biggest reason why those have stuck. So that’s – I mean I’m much more in the half-glass-full standpoint than I am that this thing is going to go a different direction.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Can half full, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Yes, good call. Fair enough.
Unidentified Analyst: Take care. Thanks so much.
Dan Fisher: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle White, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kyle White: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I go into North America. Can you just talk about the competitive dynamics there in that market just given the change in near-term demand profile? Have you seen any changes on the competitive environment? Or is this more of a kind of a wait-and-see as contracts come up for renewal?
Dan Fisher: There aren’t a great deal of contracts that come up for renewal each year. I think we believe that we’ve got somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% to 85% of our contracts locked in for the next handful of years. So we’re in a really good spot. There are always contracts that come up that volume could move on the fringes, but it’s such an efficient market and so much has to do with freight that I don’t see a lot of movement in the marketplace. I think it’s a very rational marketplace. We’re continuing to lead, we believe, that supply-demand will continue to be tight for the foreseeable future given the growth prospects of the business. And so I’m feeling good that the pricing and the terms that we’ve locked in here over the last couple of years will maintain. So we’re feeling like it’s an increasingly disciplined market. Things will remain tight, and everyone should benefit from that moving forward.
Kyle White: Got it. That sounds good. And then on the Russia sale, can you just talk about the call option there? What led you to that decision? Any kind of range of what exercise price is relative to the sale price?
Scott Morrison: Yes. The call option was – it was a great business that we didn’t really want to sell. And we would love to get back there if Russia ever normalizes their behavior, leadership and activities. So we have a call option that starts in year three and goes through year 10. And it depends – the price depends on the performance of that business at the time we exercise the option. So we thought it was absolutely the best outcome we could achieve by getting $530 million in cash into our bank accounts and then have an option to return if things normalize and we’re able to do that. But obviously, right now, that’s not terribly likely in the next few years.
Kyle White: Got it. Thank you. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess, first on beverage cans. I just wanted to understand the contracting process a little bit more. Are your customers essentially signing up for volume? Or is it a range of volumes? Or is it min/max? Just curious because there was kind of a swift slowdown, and our understanding was that most customers were kind of required to take certain levels of volume. So could you just flesh that out for us a little bit? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: I mean it’s a range of things. There is no one contract structure. So it’s everything from fixed volumes with probably some range, 5% range, up or down. There are some that are fixed for a period of time over a multiyear period. So if you’re short in one period, you’re going to need to make it up in a different period. So it really – the old requirements kind of contracts are becoming fewer and fewer, and that’s where you were more exposed to volatility. But those are becoming fewer as time goes on. We’ve gotten rid of a lot of those requirements-based contracts, which caused more of the volatility. But you’re never going to have something that is 100%. We’re usually talking around the last few percent of volume, and that can matter.
Arun Viswanathan: Got it. And then on aerospace, our understanding is that 2022 is kind of a transition year to the next, say two or three year range backlog. Is that right? And so maybe 2023 to 2025, do you expect kind of 10% to 15% EBIT growth for that business? Or how should we think about aerospace?
Dan Fisher: Over that period, yes. And north of 15% next year is what we’re looking at.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Dan Fisher: We’ll do one more question.
Operator: Thank you. The question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde: Great. Hi, Dan. Hi, Scott. Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Hi. Sure.
Mark Wilde: I just wondered, Dan, any updates on thoughts on CapEx and expansion plans as we move toward 2023?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I mean, I think as we go into 2023, we expect CapEx to drop by about $0.5 billion. And I would say, given growth rates we see in the near term, I mean we’re going to finish building in Czech Republic, and those have really good contracts supporting those investments. And we obviously have enough capital in North America for the next couple of years. So I don’t think we need to do anything meaningful on that front. So I would expect it to come down again in 2024. And – we’re a fairly big build on the aerospace side, and that’s starting to come down too.
Mark Wilde: Okay. So that sounds pretty similar to what you were talking about six weeks ago at Investor Day.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Yes, exactly. Correct.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Dan, just one other one, and I know this is a little bit challenging on a public conference call, but it does sound like you’ve taken a different tacks in terms of cost pass-through over in Europe. And so as best you’re able to, can you give us some sense of that? Because it sounds like there’s going to be no eating of energy costs going forward.
Dan Fisher: We are – it’s a nuance. I mean, I think we’re getting out ahead of the risk profile that Europe will present for the next 12 to 18 months. That’s how I would characterize it. We understand fully that they’re going to have to get their act together in the European continent in terms of transitioning to a more secure and stable energy source. And our supply base feels it first, then we feel that the end consumer feels it, our customers feel it. And if the costs go up, they’re going to need to be passed through to the end consumer straight away. There won’t be a lag on these things. And I think that’s the momentum that – and the understanding and the equilibrium that the industry needs to have. And we’re happy to take the leadership position on that. 
Mark Wilde: Okay, very good. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.
Dan Fisher: Thank you. Oh, thanks, everybody, for...
Operator: I’ll turn the call back over – for his closing remarks.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for participating. We’re really encouraged in upbeat heading into 2023. We’ll navigate the choppy environment here in the next 60, 90 days, and look forward to hearing you on the next day and seeing you at the next conference call.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation 2Q 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 4, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Fisher, CEO. Please go ahead.
Daniel Fisher: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2022 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com.  Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.  Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some introductory remarks and business performance commentary. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A.  Ball delivered stable second quarter comparable operating results amid ongoing inflation, earnings translation headwinds and regional demand volatility, largely driven by North American customers' retail price-over-volume actions. Global beverage can volumes increased 3.3% in the quarter. Aluminum aerosol volumes increased 11.3%. And we, along with NASA and industry partners, celebrated the successful initial images from the James Webb Space Telescope.  We are actively managing the company to meet the world where it is at by rephasing capital and rebasing costs while also enabling packaging innovation, aluminum supply chains and sustainability initiatives to support long-term growth and significant returns to shareholders. The Russian invasion in Ukraine has had a significant impact on the global business environment. In March, Ball announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia and is also pursuing the sale of its Russian operations.  As we noted in today's earnings release, during the quarter, a noncash, long-lived asset impairment for the Russian operations was recorded in business consolidation and other activities. Note 1 in today's earnings release contains additional information about the Russia business. The company continues to support humanitarian aid, and we thank our colleagues near the war zone for housing refugees as well as supporting each other in volunteer efforts in their local communities.  Recent highlights and activities include: our global beverage business continuing construction on 2 new facilities in EMEA, announcing a new facility in Peru and rephasing previously announced North American capital projects to balance the near-term effects of higher retail prices for canned beverages versus long-term growth for sustainable aluminum packaging.  Our North America business, pivoting its cost and capital focus to align with the near-term volume deceleration and localized supply-demand imbalances in certain North American markets, including today's announcement to cease production in our Phoenix, Arizona and St. Paul, Minnesota facilities, while also enabling multiple aluminum supply chain projects to domesticate and broaden sustainable aluminum coil supply and recycling capability across the U.S.  Our EMEA volume, growing 7.7%, with operating earnings up 4% year-over-year despite $9 million of foreign currency translation headwinds, while navigating an ongoing volatile geopolitical environment across its operating footprint.  Our South America business, managing through 2.9% volume declines due to unfavorable regional customer, product mix, diluting the volume strength that remains across the other South American countries, where we are deploying capital to enable growth.  Our global aluminum aerosol team, introducing next-gen real aluminum bottles for new categories and increasing aerosol personal care shipments. Our aluminum cups team, growing our cups presence at stadiums and venues. Our aerospace team, completing a critical design review for the NOAA Space Weather Follow-on Lagrange 1 spacecraft.  And on the sustainability front, Ball joined the World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition, encouraging value chain collaboration to drive decarbonization in the aluminum sector; our partnership to introduce electric trucks with Fleetmaster, Volvo in Fort Worth, Texas.  As we indicated on prior calls and looking forward, our global businesses are absorbing non-aluminum inflationary headwinds and experiencing additional price/cost squeeze in advance of contractual cost recovery. We also have a responsibility to do the hard things first by controlling what we can control. And all corporate functions are actively addressing their SG&A costs, and the operations are taking the opportunity to become more efficient.  In EMEA, our team is working hard to mitigate ongoing inflationary headwinds through commercial cost recovery, hedging and energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In North America, additional contractual price escalators based on PPI will phase in starting on July 1, and our work to address localized supply-demand imbalances will deliver fixed cost savings over the near term.  It is also important to understand in this environment that cans continue to win in the fastest-growing beverage categories, and underlying demand for aluminum packaging continues to be resilient despite retail shelf price increases by our customers ranging as high as 20%. Early indications are that North American customers will continue to emphasize price over volume during the second half of 2022.  And in South America, demand trends should strengthen due to the timing of World Cup and a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Incorporating year-to-date shipments, we anticipate global volume growth in the range of 5% for the full year 2022.  In summary, our global beverage team is preparing for additional demand volatility, inflation and regional customer anomalies given global economic conditions. Our customers are continuing to lean on the can as their package of choice.  And over the long term, our sustainability-driven growth thesis and long-term 4% to 6% global growth CAGR for aluminum beverage cans remains intact. Carbonated soft drinks, North American import beer, energy drinks and new categories like ready-to-drink cocktails also continue to grow in cans.  We are controlling the things we can control. In addition, we are focused on executing at a high level, rebasing the cost structure, delivering high-quality cans and enabling global supply chains through alliances and investments in long-term contracts. We appreciate the work being done across the organization and ask for your support as we navigate necessary actions.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Second quarter 2022 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.82 versus $0.86 in 2021. Second quarter 2022 included $0.02 impact of unfavorable earnings translation. Second quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher volumes with improved price/mix and higher aerospace performance, partially offset by currency translation. Comparable second quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in EMEA, other metal beverage and aerospace and a lower share count, offset by comparable operating earnings declines in North America and South America, higher interest expense, higher comparable effective tax rate and unfavorable earnings translation.  In June, the company completed new credit facilities maturing in 2027. Ball's balance sheet remains very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. As we sit here today and inclusive of operating Russia for the rest of 2022, some key additional key metrics to keep in mind.  Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 19%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $290 million. Year-end net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to be below current levels, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable is expected to be in the range of $110 million.  At this time, and given our earlier announcements about exiting Russia and other plant capital decisions, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2023 CapEx to be down meaningfully from 2022 levels. The earnings impact of volume deceleration and a higher use of working capital have led to lower-than-anticipated operating cash flow. We now anticipate returning approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in 2022 and accelerated returns to higher levels in 2023.  Rest assured, Ball will be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners. And through the lens of EVA discipline, we will manage the business effectively, partner with our supply chain and customers effectively and, when necessary, pull levers available to secure the best outcome for our shareholders. We look forward to addressing our plans to grow the business, enable the supply chain, expand innovation and increase returns and answer questions why Ball now and beyond at our September investor field trip.  With that, I'll turn it back to you, Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks, Scott. Our Drive for 10 vision will continue to serve as our guide. We know who we are, we know where we're going, and we know what is important. Great companies showcase the resiliency and discipline in uncertain economic times. And the company has an actionable plan to address costs, capital and improve returns. By providing actionable intelligence through our aerospace business, sustainable solutions through our aluminum packaging businesses and honoring our disciplined capital allocation approach, our shareholders will be rewarded, and we will be doing our part to preserve our planet.  While our ability to achieve our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2022 has been impeded by the recent deceleration in volume growth, earnings translation headwinds, ongoing inflation and the pending sale of our Russian business, our earnings, cash flow and EVA trajectories are in very good shape for 2023 and beyond.  We are rebasing our cost structure in preparation for the Russia business sale and to meet the world where it's at today. We continue to focus on increasing returns on capital deployed and to further enable growth across our global aluminum packaging and the aerospace and technologies portfolio.  We are uniquely positioned to serve the decadal shift that will favor our packages in aerospace technologies. We look forward to continuing our journey and returning value to our shareholders.  We extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. We look forward to discussing more about Ball now and beyond by highlighting our long-term growth plans and global management bench at our September 2022 Investor Day.  And with that, Chris, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: Maybe just starting off with North America. Dan, maybe just give us a bit more color in terms of which categories in particular showed deceleration? And then how are you approaching the cessation that you called out in terms of production in Arizona and Minnesota? Is this temporary idling of capacity? If so, how long? Where are we on that?
Daniel Fisher: Sure. So I'll start with the first question relative to category impacts in the second quarter. Alcohol, total alcohol, was down 3%, mostly driven by domestic beer. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you given our customers' penchant for taking price versus volume. Non-alcohol was a bit more resilient. CSD, in particular, and energy drinks grew. Total non-alcohol was up 1%; CSD, flat to up 1%; energy drinks, up 8%; sparkling water, down 5%.  The import beer was up, craft beer was down. Import beer was up double digits, 13%; craft, down low single digits; hard seltzer, down nearly 20%; F&B was up 20%; and ready-to-drink cocktails was up 60%, obviously, off of a lower base. So net-net-net, basically flat for can penetration, and it's very consistent with our customers' earnings releases as well.  Relative to the 2 facilities that were shuttered, please keep in mind, Ghansham, that we announced those closures late last night. And so it's very raw, very sensitive right now for a number of our employees. These are permanent shutterings. These facilities, one was built in 1969, one was built in the mid-70s. These are landlocked facilities. They are both reline facilities. The net capacity is approaching 4 billion units, so think about removing that.  Relative to our ability then to step into the 4% to 6% growth that we believe, and again, despite all the economic challenges this year, we'll deliver 5% growth. We have plans in place and facilities that continue to increase efficiencies in terms of their start-up. So we'll be able to step into our growth projections and goals, both from the medium and long term. And this is just a step that we've consistently done throughout our history relative to optimizing our footprint, and that's how you should be interpreting this.  Maybe I'll just turn it over to Scott to give some context in and around fixed cost savings, which is typically something that we would refer back to in times like this.
Scott Morrison: Sure. Just to clarify, when Dan said 5% growth, that was a global number he was referring to. That wasn't any particular region. I'm not going to talk about the fixed cost of these particular facilities. But historically, when we've closed facilities of this size, 2 or 3 lines, think about roughly $30 million of fixed cost for each facility that will come out as we close those, one probably later this year and one in early next year.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. That's very helpful. And then as it relates to the comments on volume outlook for the full year, the 5%, how does that break down by region, the way you see it at this point?
Daniel Fisher: You can appreciate very volatile times right now, trying to anticipate customer pricing in North America. We're seeing the second half play out to growth trajectory in South America, in line with our commentary a quarter ago. North America is going to be dependent on pricing behaviors and ongoing pricing behaviors from our customers.  And Europe has been incredibly resilient. We were just there -- I was just there last week and over the weekend, been over there multiple times, same with South America, to just keep a pulse on what's going on in those markets. I feel confident that we'll be within the 4% to 6% range globally. Difficult to parse out specifics quarter-to-quarter right now, to be candid with you, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, Dan. Is North America tracking negative, thus far, in 3Q?
Daniel Fisher: No, flat to slight increase through July.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.
Adam Samuelson: So I guess I'm just trying to -- the comments in the press release about being on a path to return to 10% to 15% earnings growth in 2023, I want to just be clear, that's going to be off of some sort of lower 2022 base. That's not kind of a long-term CAGR off of a prior period. And where you'd previously calibrated 2022 earnings would be below the 10% to 15% target, kind of any -- where we are halfway through the year, any way to help us narrow in on where earnings growth actually is looking this year? And if there's any kind of the key buckets by region to think about bigger headwinds or against that, that would be very helpful.
Scott Morrison: Sure. This is Scott. I mean, I think given like in total, given the softer outlook that we see in North America versus what we had initially thought, given what our customers' pricing strategies and mix have been, the loss of the customer in South America, what inflation is doing kind of around the world, the timing and sale of our Russia business as well as euro earnings translation, I think it's going to be tough to match last year's comparable operating earnings in 2022. So the comment about next year is off that kind of base.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess then, I mean, you still talk about kind of optimism long term on 4% to 6% kind of volume growth. But I guess, would it be fair to say the actions in North America that you're taking, kind of what you're seeing from a customer kind of and market perspective this year, especially maybe relative to prior plans, is that -- to get to that 4% to 6% kind of longer-term volume growth, it might be skewed considerably more heavily towards international markets than you might have thought 12 or 24 months ago. And any -- just how you think about the regional composition of that growth over the medium term, if that's changed at all.
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I think that's fair. I think, to be clear, we entered the year thinking that we would have grown in North America double digits, and we've clearly come off of that given the first and the second quarter and the pricing decisions from our customers. Much of the growth trajectory relative to what we said, the underlying tenets relative to the medium and long term 4% to 6% growth, that still holds for every market. And we need our customers to return to a semblance of pricing strategy, which they've implied and implored over decades.  Right now, they're pushing forth price in excess of inflationary costs, and they're margining on that. So if there's a modicum of return to a different pricing strategy, we will benefit from that in terms of an uptick in volume in North America. We've had a resilient Europe business that continues to grow. We're investing in that business.  South America entered into a recession well in advance of the other markets. They seem to be turning the tide in that region of the world. So stepping into '23, we will see some benefits of growth, hopefully, tailwinds coming out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. We're certainly seeing early signs of that.  And in North America -- it's a pricing discussion in Europe. As I said, we've been over there several times. We're concerned about what's going on, as every business is, relative to energy and what's going to happen with natural gas pipeline flows. But the underpinnings of what we're hearing, both from our customers, substrate penetration and aluminum investment, coupled with the fact that a lot of our customers continue to push cans in that part of the world, gives us belief that it's not a matter of if, it's when.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.
Christopher Parkinson: You did this a minute ago, but can you just break out just kind of your intermediate-term views for the substrates? You mentioned alcoholic, nonalcoholic energy drinks, RTD off of perhaps a lower basis. How should we be thinking about bridging what's happening right here right now versus, let's say, the first half of '23, specifically North America?
Daniel Fisher: Very difficult to comment on a bridge to the beginning of '23 because these numbers have a direct impact on our customer pricing strategy. Our customers have taken year-over-year north of 20% price, and their volumes are flat. So if that were to moderate back to less price take and more interest in volume, all of these numbers will be improved.  That as a backdrop, I'll go over the categories again. For total alcohol category, it was down 3%; domestic beer, down 5%; import beer, up double digits; craft, down slightly 3%; hard seltzers, down nearly 20%; F&B, up 20%; and ready-to-drink cocktails, up nearly 60% off of a very small base.  The nonalcoholic categories were -- they grew slightly, 1%; CSD, 1%; energy drinks, 8%; and sparkling water was down 5%. So in total, that nets out to 0 growth for the industry in the quarter. How that translates into the second half of the year, just refer back to my pricing comments on the customers. That is -- that will drive end consumer behavior, and it will drive volume, which is what we're most interested in relative to our customer commentary.
Christopher Parkinson: Understood. And just a quick follow-up on Latin America, and specifically, Brazil. Obviously, there's some choppiness in the fourth quarter, first quarter. It seems like it's abating a little bit. There's some optimism for the World Cup in the fourth quarter this year. Just how should we think about that -- kind of that bridge and your confidence in that boost towards year-end based on what you're hearing right here, right now in the alcoholic category?
Daniel Fisher: Thank you. Q4 and Q1 were down significantly. And as I mentioned, the end consumers -- and you can revert back to earlier commentary from us publicly, end consumer purchasing power was up 30% to 40% in Q4 and Q1 from prior period. In Q1, volume, our hectoliter was down nearly 20% in that market. We saw a return to a modicum of flat in Q2. That was in line with our expectations.  What we saw, early parts of the third quarter, we're returning to double-digit growth year-over-year for us in South America. As you mentioned, incredibly volatile, the world is. One month does not make a quarter, but it's in line with our anticipation heading into both an election, further stimulus in Brazil and the World Cup falling in a winter quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George Staphos: Dan, if you could help us understand, to the extent possible, what was going on in North Las Vegas and what your plans are there and kind of the background there. Will you need to supply to the customers that should have been supplied by that facility from other facilities or not?
Daniel Fisher: The answer is no at this point. We will -- we have put a pause. We've had conversations with the anchor tenants there, those customers. Think about this as a 6- to 9-month rephasing. We can engineer. We can put the lines in. The phasing impediment right now would just be the speed with which we could hire the labor. So this is absolutely going to happen. It's just the rebasing and rephasing of timing.
George Staphos: Okay. And then this question has come up a couple of times with my peer analysts, and I want to take another try at it. So you're still guiding to a long-term 4% to 6% growth rate for the can. You mentioned it's very difficult to determine at this juncture, and we understand what the growth might look like this year because part of it is driven by what the promotional strategy will be from the customers. And you obviously can't speak for or know exactly what the customers are going to do. So with that as a backdrop, how can you have confidence, what gives you confidence, if there's a way to quantify at all, in the 4% to 6% and how it might vary across the regions?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. It'd be difficult to parse out the regions. I will tell you, on a global basis, I'll reaffirm, we believe that we'll be growing at mid-single digits for the year. And George, probably much like yourself, I've never seen a geopolitical, an inflationary environment, a macroeconomic environment as unstable as the one we have right now, and we're growing in the range. A couple other things to point to. We are in constant contact with our customers. We are in constant contact with our suppliers of filling equipment. And we're -- and there have been 3 multibillion rolling mill investments announced in the last 90 days.  So parsing out 2023 relative to the regional dynamics, a bit difficult to discuss right now. We'll have a clearer picture of that at our Investor Day. We'll be entering our budget conversations. All of us will be out on the road talking to customers in different parts of the other world on an ongoing basis to stay close to this. But I have a firm underpinning and belief in the variables that will drive the circularity story and the sustainability story that allow us to get to that growth thesis that we outlined a couple of years ago. It still holds.
Scott Morrison: George, I think everybody -- given how volatile the world is, I think everybody has a bit of a recency bias to kind of say, "Okay, what have we seen in the last 90 days and what's going to happen going forward?" Nothing has changed if you think about -- nothing has changed about the sustainability benefits of the can and the long-term attractiveness of the package.  And so -- and the conversations we're having with our customers, we were in Europe a couple of weeks ago, there's a plan for 118 filling lines at our various customers across Europe over the next several years. So the customers are looking at this as a long-term proposition. They're doing some things in the short term that are disruptive, that are not helpful from a volume standpoint in North America. But long term, the can is going to continue to win.  And so we think we're kind of -- we got excited when we said -- in 2018, at the Investor Day, we said that 4% to 6% growth. Then growth accelerated, and now it's moderating a bit, but it's still back to that 4% to 6%. And so I think if everybody takes a step back and looks forward, all the benefits of the can, none of that's changed. And we've got to do things in the near term because we have localized supply-demand imbalances that we're going to -- we have to fix that. And we've got to do some focus, frankly, on our SG&A costs that have probably gotten ahead of where they need to be. And so we're going through department by department and figuring out what things do we really need to be spending money on and what things don't we need to be. And that's going to put us in a position that when this inflation moderates and when we get the escalators in our contracts that contractually happen, we're going to like the results of that combination a lot.
George Staphos: Sure. Scott, I appreciate that. And my last one is a great segue. So with that as a backdrop and given your input to take a longer-term view relative to a last, whatever, 30-, 90-day view, you also reduced your value return target from $1.75 billion to $1 billion. Can you help us bridge how you get there? What were the consideration in terms of dropping that?
Scott Morrison: Thanks, George. Yes, sure. Well, we're going to make less money than what we thought originally when we came into the year. We're going to use -- there's going to be a use of working capital, about $350 million. If you look in the second quarter, our inventories, we were building inventories for what we thought would be a more robust season here in North America that didn't show up. So we're going to have to take focus on that in the back half of the year, but we're still going to have a use of working capital in the range of $350 million. We're still too early in the process to know what the sale of our Russia business will yield us. So we're being cautious around that front. And then we've got a customer issue in South America that -- the customer who defaulted on their contract isn't paying us.  So all those things kind of lead us to reel in the share -- the value return for right now. But trust me, in the long term, our focus on that has not changed at all. And so that's when we look at capital for next year. We see a meaningful reduction of growth capital because we can put it in more slowly over a longer period of time, dial it back and be in a position to be able to ramp up the return of value to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari: We're coming off a number of years where North America was sold out and we were importing cans from all over the world. I just want to understand how you think the North American market sits or maybe where your system sits once these closures are completed. Could there still be some slack in the North American market? Will you be back to essentially running full out? I'm just wondering, directionally, if you could talk about where North American operating rates may be exiting the year.
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Thank you. There's a confluence of events that are happening, and this is a short-term or near-term answer, which is, there could be flat capacity for the near term, simply because we're ramping up large asset bases: Pittston, Glendale. And we've made further line investments over the last couple of years. So the efficiencies of all of those lines are improving really nicely. So they were anticipating a higher volume number.  So I think in the next 6 to 9 months, I think there's a wait to see exactly the dynamics relative to supply-demand. But rest assured, we have an industry leadership position. We understand. We've taken a view to optimize the network. We've consistently done that over the last decade. Strong belief in the medium to long term, but we need to meet the world where it's at right now, and those are the decisions that we took yesterday.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, I mean, is the situation in North America solely that your customers are seeing lower volumes with promotional strategies and tougher inflation environment? Or are you walking away maybe from some business that doesn't meet the current thresholds? Or is it some combination of those 2 things? I'm just wondering what you can share there.
Daniel Fisher: Well, we're not walking away. I mean, we've historically always walked away if we don't have an EVA return. So that's -- but that's not a recency bias. This is 100% our customers are putting up price in advance of inflation, and their volume is zero. And we are impacted by the 0 volume growth.
Scott Morrison: Anthony, I would just add, in terms of the customers, we've entered into some new contracts recently that we like the economics on those contracts a lot. And we'll start to see those benefits as we get into '23.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Michael Leithead: I appreciate all the detail, especially by category, in North America. First, is there any update you can provide on the Russia divestment? And Scott, just to be clear, when you gave an earlier answer or commentary about this year's EPS, are you assuming some sort of sale of Russia within fiscal '22?
Scott Morrison: No. Well, one, I gave direction on comparable earnings, not EPS. But -- and Russia was inclusive of those numbers for the full year. The process -- we have a pretty robust process going on currently, and it continues to progress, and we'll see where we get to in the end. So that's kind of what I can tell you right now. Hopefully, we'll have more information when we get to our Investor Day in later September as to where we're at in the process and what's happening and time frame and all of that.
Michael Leithead: Great. I appreciate that. And second, I just kind of wanted to go back to North America. And I appreciate customer behaviors are a little bit different the past -- or a lot different the past 3 months. But between the 2 plant announcements last night and the delayed new plant, I mean, it feels like a pretty big deviation from where we're all thinking for '23 and even about 2% or 3% of North America market.  But just -- as you mentioned, you take these decisions quite seriously. So I mean, is it fair to say your growth conversations are changing quite a bit with the customers? I guess, I'm just trying to square your medium-term confidence swells, kind of shrinking your plans there a bit.
Daniel Fisher: Yes. So just one clarification. The pricing behavior hasn't happened over the last 3 months. We've had, in aggregate, each quarter over the last 4 quarters, our customers have taken up, on average, 7% price increases. So you're getting to a point now where, year-over-year, you're looking at 20%, almost 30% price increases in some of these products. That absolutely has an impact on discretionary and consumer buying. And we're looking at that, and we're making adjustments. We're optimizing our footprint. This is a near-term balance for us. We've optimized the efficiencies across our system. We're constantly looking at this. I'll remind you that these 2 plants, 1 was built in 1969, 1 was built in 1975. So that should give you some thought in terms of what we need to do relative to what we've seen over the last year in terms of the pricing behavior from our customers.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan: So yes, I just wanted to, I guess, drill down further into the demand outlook here. So obviously, we've gone through a period of very robust growth. It looks like we're normalizing into a more historical range. What's it going to take to kind of reaccelerate to maybe a slightly higher rate of growth?  You noted seltzers were down 20%, and we've all been seeing the data there. But have you seen any pickup in either the amount of new beverages that are going into cans? Or any trends, as far as still water or anything else, that would potentially drive growth back or accelerate growth as we look out into the next year or so?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. Thank you. So just one major point of clarification. Our historical growth rates were 1% to 2% for 20 years heading into '19. We just communicated, I think, multiple times in this call that we believe we'll grow at 5% this year. So we're 2 to 3x what the historical growth rate is and in line with our long-term investment thesis for growth. As it relates to categories and innovation, absolutely. We're seeing ready-to-drink cocktails growing at 60% off of a small base. We're seeing energy drinks continuing to grow at high single-digit growth rates. If you refer back to several calls over the last quarters, I have said multiple times, our business doesn't move quarter-to-quarter. It moves over 6- to 9-month digestion period.  So retail shelf space, filling locations, promotional activity to push around things like RTD cocktails, those things, as they start to happen, they will fill out the retail sales and rebase areas that are seeing modicums of decline. And so yes, I'm very bullish on ready-to-drink cocktails. I'm bullish on energy drinks continuing.  CSD, that is a plastic-to-aluminum substrate shift. And despite the 20-plus percent price increases we've seen in those areas, it's still very resilient to flat to a slight growth. So all of those things give me comfort that what we're seeing in terms of an appreciable differentiated, higher growth rate versus historical norms will maintain and continue for an extended period of time.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And then -- so I understand that the facilities that you're shuttering are potentially on the higher end of the cost curve and a little bit older relative to your rest of your production base. So I guess, how should we think about capital from here on?  So I know your growth projects are still on track. But maybe if you could lay out how you're thinking about CapEx over the next several years. I know that, obviously, you've moderated the capital return, but are there other levers you can pull on CapEx to potentially get that capital return back up?
Scott Morrison: Yes. Yes, I mentioned that we expect this year -- the things that we're paying for in the back half of the year are essentially things that are in the ground. We have pretty good, favorable payable terms on most of the capital. So that's why we can't change it a heck of a lot this year. It's going to be -- I think we've taken it down about $100 million from what we thought 3 months ago. So it's like $1.7 billion. I would expect, as we look at 2023 -- and we'll update you. As Dan mentioned, we'll be doing our planning here over the next couple of months, and we'll be able to give you a better number at the Investor Day. But I would expect our capital to come down meaningfully in 2023, just because the growth has moderated, but it's still in that mid-single digits, but it's not the double digits that some people thought we would hit this year. So we're able to dial back that capital, and that gives us more opportunity to return value to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley.
Angel Castillo: So Dan, I just wanted to, I guess, dig in a little bit more into 2023. I appreciate we're going to get more details at the Investor Day, but any sense for that CapEx reduction, roughly where that might be coming from? I assume maybe within North America -- or just as you think about the future plans that you've kind of laid out where that, I guess, reduction might be sourced from.
Daniel Fisher: Sure. Thank you. Yes, there's been an awful lot of focus on volume on this call. I think if you reflect on Scott's comments relative to sort of the downturn in earnings that we anticipated 60, 90 days ago, keep in mind, there's been a hell of a lot of headwinds on inflation. That inflation is going to come back to us next year. That number is higher than what we anticipated to get coming into this year. So earnings should be reflective of an improved PPI mechanism. Keep in mind, we pass through inflation in both Europe and North America a year in arrears. So that will be, as we sit here today, a good guy. And we will further document that and bring more specificity to that number a month from now as we do our homework there. And then relative to capital and some of the other comments, I'll turn that over to Scott. But we're good stewards of capital. The stuff that has been going into the ground, we're paying for that now. And then we should be reflecting and rephasing capital over the next year if we continue to see our customer pricing strategy. But more specific, Scott, if there's anything I missed there.
Scott Morrison: Well, I just -- we're -- our aerosol business continues to grow. Our aerospace business continues to grow. I think we're going to -- we're really scrutinizing all of our capital. We were just on a call yesterday with some of our colleagues. And we need to be -- we're progressing on both European projects that we have. We built the Paraguay plant a couple of years ago. We're liking the results of that, and we're going to do another plant in Peru. So it's not like the growth has stopped. It's definitely slowed down, and frankly, at a more moderate pace, which will be better. And so we're looking at capital and our costs every part of the overall business.
Angel Castillo: That's very helpful. And then as we think about maybe the medium to longer term, I wanted to maybe revisit a couple of things you mentioned. One was maybe on the inventories front, and then I think there was a mention of kind of a customer default that we were kind of dealing with. So as you think about maybe 2022 and what some of these items that might be kind of onetime and we should recover from and should get back to kind of growth next year and give you comfort of returning back to growth, anything else outside of those 2 or others that you can kind of point to that are maybe more specific to Ball or just kind of to this year that we can then look at as we think next year. And industry growth returning back, anything with market share or, again, with the inventory levels, et cetera?
Scott Morrison: No. Those are the big ones. I mean the inventory, we -- I've been around for 22 years, and you never want to scale back your production until you get to the summer season. Because if you're not ready to service your customers in the summer, those are sales that are lost. So we built inventory for the first half of the year expecting more robust growth than what we've seen. So now we've got to be a little more focused on inventory for the back half of the year and bring that down to more reasonable levels.  And the customer default, I've been here 22 years, that's the first time I've ever seen a customer that we have a legal contract with that has chosen not to complete that contract. So I think that's a bit of a one-off. So those are the big things that are changing, and we're going to make less money than we thought in total. So that's why we're having to be cautious about the return of value to shareholders in the near term, but we think we're setting ourselves up really nicely for 2023 to improve all of those things.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.
Michael Roxland: Wanted just to take a dig a little further into North America. You provided a lot of great comment, by the way. I -- we appreciate it. Just one of your peers mentioned volume growth in North America of 1% in 2Q, was guiding 2023 to be up double digits. I know that peer mentioned growth in North America of -- in 2Q of mid-single digits. Would it be a fair comment to say that maybe you overestimated growth somewhat in the southwest region relative to demand? You guys do have a fair amount of capacity in that region with -- I think, Dan, you mentioned in terms of like in a good year, I think you have 4 lines; Glendale, it could be 3 or 4 lines. So maybe relative to the demand that actually occurred in that region, you've -- you're being a little bit too aggressive with your -- with the capacity expansion?
Daniel Fisher: No. I appreciate the question and the thoughtfulness of the question. That's -- it's inaccurate. In fact, the southwest is performing in line with our expectations. Keep in mind, and this has been disclosed in previous calls, we have an anchor tenant in Glendale that we do business globally with. And they continue to grow significantly and in line with our expectations in that facility in particular.
Scott Morrison: I would also point out that everyone in the industry probably has a bit of a different customer mix. And so that could account for some differences in what people talk about.
Michael Roxland: Got it. Okay. And one quick follow-up. Dan, you mentioned retail prices being up 20%, 30%. Your customer volumes are flat. So it could be that consumer -- that ultimately consumers are trading down to some extent given these price increases. Could you remind us of your private label exposure? And any push possibly to increase your private label exposure given the current environment?
Daniel Fisher: We have -- in general, I think we have like-for-like comparables probably with the rest of the industry participants in that area. A lot of it just has to do with what filling partners you have relationships with. And those private labels, it's very hard to parse that out. You'd have to look at IRI scanner data because what will happen is you'll be shipping cans with labels into filling locations that are all full.  So they may be trading out there. We'd be sending can volume into a customer that's really a filling location for an end consumer. And sometimes those aren't even graphics on cans, they are shrink sleeves. So difficult to parse that out. I agree with you on trading down. We have seen trading down. Typically, where you see that, is you see that in rural areas first versus urban areas. We saw that going back to the later part of the first quarter. So what you'll see is a 12-pack versus a 12-pack and a trade-down, and then you'll eventually see volumetric trade-downs. And so not as much of the category shifts as much as it is.  Exactly to your point, you would see base labels, high-end labels being traded down to medium, to lesser labels being traded down to share a stomach. And so we haven't hit the share of stomach trade-down across the landscape. But as price increases continue at this rate, you -- that would be the concern is that you may start to see the volumetric trade-down.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.
John Dunigan: This is John Dunigan on for Phil. I wanted to stay on North America for a second. Now the tightness that we've seen in the market up until really this year led to a lot of favorable contract renegotiations, which I thought had volume requirements baked in. Is that not the case? Or is some of that just getting pushed out for your customers?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I'll start and then turn it over to Scott. I would say the new contracts are performing in line with what our expectations were. Keep in mind, that's not the majority of our business. Scott, anything else?
Scott Morrison: Yes. So all the new assets we put in the ground and the contracts that support those are progressing. I mean, if you take a step back, every contract is going to have some range of what they can do month-to-month. I mean, nobody gets their forecast 100% right. So in our case, where we're at, it's kind of like 95% right. And so that 5%, we're feeling that. But that's kind of normal. But the contract provisions that we've been talking about, the favorable contract provisions that we've talked about for the last couple of years are definitely showing up in what we're seeing.
John Dunigan: Okay. And then in terms of like maybe a bull case scenario, you're shutting about 8% of the North America capacity for Ball and pushing out another, say, 4%. So in this bull case where you maybe return to that 4% to 6% CAGR quicker than expected here in North America, do you have any capacity to meet that demand with the ramp-up of your other projects? And maybe you can give some insight on kind of how operating rates look in broad terms.
Daniel Fisher: Yes, absolutely. We have dry powder to step into. We were going to, on an annualized basis, add 12 billion units this year. We're saying we're going to take 4 billion from that. But keep in mind, the knock-on effect from efficiency builds moving forward will enable us to step into growth in excess at the high end of the 6% range, if it shows up. The other thing we're in constant conversation with our customers, anchor tenants and the previously disclosed greenfields that we're anticipating in North America, and we could very quickly move into engineering and executing against those. So this doesn't have an impact really for us to be able to step into really nice growth in '23 and beyond.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.
Mark Wilde: I want to just turn at the end of the call here from volume over to the cost. We are in a higher inflation environment than we've seen for 4 decades. Can you talk about what you might be doing or trying to do in some of the contract renegotiations to both speed the pass-through of non-aluminum costs and then also to maybe match up the escalators that you use so that they better square with the actual costs that you're incurring?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I mean the PPI and CPI, various escalators that we've used over time, have been pretty effective in most environments. And what we're feeling right now is a bit of a short-term squeeze because inflation has been accelerated at a pace we have -- nobody seen in 4 years. So we don't want to be too reactionary to the changes of what's worked in this business for a long time. However, I will say, we are looking at a variety of things in contracts to make them tighter so that there is less leakage and there's quicker response to big changes in costs. But those things take time to implement. So in some places that have experienced high inflation, think of like a lot of emerging markets that we operate in, they do have very effective and quick cost pass-throughs because they've experienced hyperinflation for a long period of time.  In North America and Europe, that hasn't been the case. So the annual pass-through has worked. And we're seeing the benefits -- we're -- the pass-through mechanisms are working. It's just that we've had another round of inflation to the tune of $100 million this year that we're having choked out.
Daniel Fisher: But maybe I'll close...
Scott Morrison: Let me also add on, on the SG&A side, that's something that is different. And we are looking -- in fact, we've already started this. We're going through every support function and looking at things that we need to stop doing and things where we can take out costs to get our SG&A in line. Now we're already seeing that SG&A feel from most of those that have incentive compensation.  And one of the reasons the corporate line looks better is we're not going to get paid as much this year. So we're kind of in line with what the shareholders are seeing. And so we're very focused on our corporate costs and our support costs, and we expect to reap a lot of cost savings out of those areas. That's something we haven't had to do in a while.
Daniel Fisher: Mark, one area that we haven't spent a great deal of time on previous calls -- we spent an awful lot of time on cost recovery relative to our customer contracts. We're spending a lot more time on our supply contracts, and what's embedded in those supply contracts are extraordinary clauses. Think about our ODMs on the chemical side.  We need to ensure that the supply contracts mirror our customer contracts, and that would be an area not where we would pass through cost more expeditiously, but we wouldn't be absorbing costs that are decoupled from our customer contract. And that has a margin improvement ability to it as well.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's helpful. Listen, one other just real quick one, and I think I know the answer here. But this lower growth you're seeing in North American beverage cans, this is not going to have any impact, is it, on these planned can sheet expansions or the timing around those expansions, particularly the Mana project?
Daniel Fisher: The answer as of today is no. We don't anticipate that. It's -- again, these assets will come online 3 and 4 years from now. So I think we were just -- we were actually just with a number of folks earlier this week having those conversations, and it was all go forward, continue. They believe strongly in the circularity message, as do we. So yes, thanks for that question. No, I think people are very bullish about continuing to invest in and around the circularity story of aluminum and beverage packaging.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.
Adam Josephson: Can you just talk about the visibility you have into North American demand? So I mean, for two years, the industry was caught short. And now you're, in effect, caught long. Can you just talk about what your normal visibility is? How many months of it you have compared to what it might be now?
Daniel Fisher: No. That's a great question. It's actually much longer than it used to be historically because of the fear of missing out relative to our customers being able to step into cans with innovation. The big challenge here for us is what we don't have access to, and you can -- it probably makes a ton of sense. I don't have access, or we don't have access to pricing strategies by our customers. That's the big dislocator right now in terms of what we're seeing from a volume standpoint. And that is something they hold very close to their vest. And so that's a challenge where -- we're having conversations relative to where they're at right now versus the sizable price increases over the last 9 months. So you get a revisit point probably every 6 to 9 months with your customers. But if they've decided to go much stronger on price in a 120- or 180-day period, you can have dislocation like we're experiencing right now on volumes.
Scott Morrison: What I would say, the thing where we have more visibility to today than we had 6, 7 years ago is the mid- and long-term strategy of our customers, what they're planning to do with their mix, with their package mix and sizes and all of that and the investments that they're making on the filling side. We have better visibility into that. It's the near-term stuff that's a little bit more challenging.
Adam Josephson: Got it, and I appreciate that. And Dan, just along somewhat similar lines. You mentioned in the release that you saw the deceleration in demand late in the second quarter. But as you mentioned earlier, your customers have been raising prices for, call it, a year now. So I guess, why would it all have seemingly come to a head quite recently as -- why would it not have happened 3 months ago, 6 months ago? Why all of a sudden was did you just -- did growth just hit a wall, seemingly so, at least?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. There's certainly a recency bias. I don't know if I had a specific answer to that. However, for us, the there's always been Memorial Day to 4th of July promotional activity, and consumers were anticipating that. It didn't come through. There's less going into everyone's grocery basket right now. So I think there's a recency bias. I don't know, Scott, you've got a thought on that?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I mean, we've been looking at a lot of economic data. And what's been happening most recently, if you look at some of the most recent things, you're starting to see the consumer get pinched more, okay? The second quarter, you had fuel prices rising. Now the good thing is that fuel prices are coming off a little bit.  But all the stimulus money that was pumped into the economy, I think a lot of that has been spent through in the first part of the year. And now you're starting to see delinquencies tick up as it relates to student loans, to credit cards for people that are 20 to 35. So you're starting to see that consumer get pinched more, more recently because a lot of that stimulus money has now been spent through the economy. So I think we're -- we'll see. What you used to see is if they raised price 2%, their volumes would decline 1% or 2%. And for a period of time, that hasn't happened. But I think we're going to start to see that in their volumes, and that's where we're more bullish. As we look out long term and things normalize, we think we'll get back to kind of a more normal situation.
Adam Josephson: And just lastly on that, you've always talked about beverage cans as pretty recession-resistant, and everyone has. Is there -- is it any less so now than has been the case historically just because of the magnitude of this inflation and these extraordinary price increases that you just -- the demand elasticity just takes over at some point, and there's nothing anyone can do about it?
Scott Morrison: No. I don't think it's changed in terms of recession-resistant. I mean, if you look at it, if you -- again, you take a step back -- and everybody's kind of digesting these numbers real time, right? We've had a little bit of time to look at it and digest it. The world is a mess. And our earnings are holding up reasonably well. I mean, it's not anywhere near where we want them to be, not anywhere near. We're disappointed in where we're at. But if you look at the world, it's not that bad. And so I think this is still a recession-resistant business, but it is clearly not immune to shocks when you have 40-year inflation, a land war in Europe, euro deflation. You're going to feel short-term knocks from those things. Energy price is skyrocketing in Europe. You're going to feel short-term knocks.  But the long-term beauty of this business is it will grow, it will flow cash, and it will get nice returns. And so I think we feel pretty good about where we're at. We're not happy with where we're at. We're going to do a bunch of things that we need to do in the near term to address a lot of these things, but the long term is still intact.
Daniel Fisher: Adam, one thing to pay attention to, we're clearly a lot closer to this. So one thing to pay attention to, if you look at our customers that are simply passing through inflationary costs and not margining up, they are growing significantly. And so it is hugely resilient. What's decoupled right now is customers putting up significant price over and above inflationary cost pressures and margining up. So that's going to have a volumetric impact. That's not recession. That is a pricing strategy. So I just refer back to customers that have taken a middle-of-the-road pricing approach and just pass through cost. They're growing, and we're growing with them. Chris, that's -- I think that's all for now. We'll talk to everybody again in 90 days.
Daniel Fisher: The investor conference is going to be on September 22. Look forward to seeing as many of you as can make it.
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, May 5, 2022. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dan Fisher, CEO. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's first quarter 2022 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the Company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some introductory remarks and business performance commentary. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with closing comments and Q&A. Ball delivered strong first quarter results amid significant geopolitical and economic conditions. Our company remains deeply troubled by the war in Ukraine, and our focus is on the safety and well-being of our colleagues. In addition, our global employee giving program, and the Ball Foundation to date have provided in excess of $1 million of financial support for humanitarian aid. And our colleagues near the war zone are housing refugees as well as supporting each other in volunteer efforts in their local communities. We thank our employees and the broader global community for their acts of compassion and giving. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had a significant impact upon the global business environment. Late in the first quarter, Ball announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia and is pursuing the sale of its aluminum beverage packaging business located in Russia. As we noted in today's earnings release, our ability to achieve our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal is dependent upon the outcome of our announced intention to sell our Russian business. Note one in today's earnings release contains additional information about the Russia business. To our team in EMEA, we are proud of your professionalism and your quality work during an unimaginable stressful and constantly evolving situation. We are thankful for your support of one another. Looking beyond the challenges that 2022 has presented so far and focusing on the opportunities before us, let's remember the basics. We are the largest producer of sustainable aluminum packaging for beverages and personal care products in the world, and we deliver exquisite aerospace technologies that keep us safe, informed and inquisitive about what's happening on earth and in deep space. Ball has a proven track record of achieving success through leveraging customer focus, sustainability, our people and culture, operational excellence and innovation to drive profitable growth, EVA and cash flow. No matter the economic climate or the ways of the world, we will adapt, remain agile and grow. Ball has 142 years of experience doing just that. Ball is a recession-resistant company that can effectively manage rising cost over time and will deploy capital to garner the highest possible EVA returns and value to shareholders. With our EVA discipline and drive for 10-vision as our guide, we are keeping calm, carrying on and enabling a brighter future for our planet and our people. Turning to first quarter performance. Global beverage can volumes were up 1.4%. Global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 10%. Aerospace backlog increased 28%. Comparable operating earnings increased 6%, and comparable diluted earnings per share increased 7%. And our teams were successful offsetting significant cost inflation through pass-throughs, cost recovery programs and procurement actions. Our year-to-date business highlights include: our global beverage business ramping up new lines and breaking ground on two new facilities in North America and EMEA. Our North America business growing comparable operating earnings 24% and growing volume over 3% by successfully ramping up new domestic can-making capacity while weaning ourselves off imports into North America and the team effectively built inventory back to reasonable levels ahead of the busy summer selling season. In addition, the North America team achieved dual ASI certifications during the quarter. Our EMEA volume growing 10% with operating earnings being flat year-over-year despite $7.5 million of foreign currency translation and late quarter cost inflation, not to mention the team navigating a volatile geopolitical environment across its operating footprint. Our South America business managing through 21% volume declines due to unfavorable customer mix economic volatility and poor weather in Brazil, diluting the volume strength that remains across other South American countries where we are deploying capital to enable can growth. Our global aluminum aerosol team introducing re-closable aluminum bottles for new categories and increasing aerosol shipments by 10%. Our aluminum cups team, installing a new line in Rome, Georgia, to manufacture new 9- and 12-ounce cups with production starting in second quarter. Our cup achieving 90% recycled content, winning an Edison Award and signing a contract with Sodexo Live to expand our cup's presence at stadiums and venues. Our aerospace team expanding its backlog by 28%, completing its critical design review on SPHEREx and marveling at the on-orbit success of the James Webb Space Telescope with images for public consumption expected in the early summer. And Ball joining the UN Global Compact to demonstrate our commitment to aligning our business strategies and operations with universal sustainability principles. As we indicated on prior calls and looking forward, our global businesses are absorbing nonaluminum inflationary headwinds and experiencing additional price/cost squeeze in advance of contractual cost recovery. In EMEA, inflationary headwinds accelerated late in the quarter. And going forward, our team is working hard to mitigate their impact through ongoing commercial cost recovery, hedging and energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In North America, contractual price escalators based on PPI and other indices have been effective and will continue to phase in throughout the year. We continue to rely on our supply chain for raw material inputs and look forward to additional alliances and investments being announced in 2022 to support domestic U.S. production of aluminum can sheet to further enable long-term growth and substrate shifts to sustainable aluminum packaging for new and existing categories. Underlying demand for aluminum beverage cans remains strong. We exited 2021 with 12 billion units of new installed capacity, and we also have plans in place to exit 2022 with a similar level of new installed capacity available to sell-through in 2023 and beyond. In summary, our global beverage team is preparing ourselves and our supply chains for long-term durable growth while managing notable volatility. Our customers are continuing to lean on the can as their package of choice. Year-to-date, carbonated soft drinks and energy drinks have accelerated their move into cans. And in beer, cans have maintained package mix share despite declines in total liquid consumption. By region, trends are in North America, following the broader reopening of on-premise, cans continue to outperform all other packaging substrates in aggregate. Strength in energy, CSD and import beer has bolstered demand for cans. In South America, rising can demand and liquid consumption growth in countries outside of Brazil were unable to offset a 15% decline in total liquid beer consumption in Brazil, though cans maintain their share versus other substrates during the quarter. In EMEA, cans continue to outperform other packaging substrates, particularly in CSD and energy. And we continue to see the need for imports from our Saudi and Indian beverage can plants for the remainder of the year. We are operating safely, controlling the things we can control, focused on executing at a high level and recovering costs, delivering high-quality cans to our customers supported by equitable contracts and closely monitoring and enabling global supply chains through alliances and investments in long-term contracts. We look forward to highlighting our long-term growth plans and management bench at our September 2022 Investor Day. We appreciate the amazing work being done across the organization and extend our thanks to all of our employees and external stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. First quarter 2022 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.77 versus $0.72 in 2021, an increase of 7%. First quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher volumes with improved price/mix and higher aerospace performance, partially offset by currency translation. Comparable first quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in North America metal beverage and aerospace offset by comparable operating earnings declines in South America, higher corporate costs and unfavorable earnings translation. Ball's balance sheet remains very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2022. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 19%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. Year-end net debt to comparable EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 3.5x, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable is expected to be in the range of $120 million. At this time, and given our earlier public announcement about Russia, we expect 2022 total CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion and to return in the range of $1.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in 2022. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025 from year-end 2020 levels and look forward to more opportunities to invest in our businesses and to accelerate the return of value to shareholders. Rest assured, Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash. As fellow owners and through the lens of EVA discipline, we will manage the business as owners, partner with our supply chain and customers effectively to secure the best outcome for our shareholders. Ball reached a few important milestones this year. 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of EVA. That discipline has served us well in the past, and it will serve us well in the current economic environment. 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of Ball's initial public offering. Last week, we announced that effective May 10, our stock ticker will change from BLL to BALL. Back in the 1970s, four-letter ticker symbols were unavailable. And to ensure that the BALL ticker stays right at home with Ball Corporation, we're making this seamless change. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Scott. As I embark on my tenure as Ball's CEO, our drive for vision will continue to serve as our guide. We know who we are, we know where we're going and we know what is important. Great companies perform in uncertain economic times, and Ball is a great company. By providing actionable intelligence through our aerospace business, sustainable solutions through our aluminum packaging businesses and honoring our disciplined capital allocation approach, our shareholders will be rewarded, and we will be doing our part to preserve our planet. While our ability to achieve our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2022 is dependent on the outcome of our announced intention to sell our Russian business, our earnings, cash flow and EVA trajectories are in very good shape now and in 2023 and beyond as we increase returns on newly deployed capital and further enable and serve growth in our aluminum packaging and aerospace and technologies portfolio. We are a world-class manufacturing company with a fabulous team, the most capable and agile global footprint, the confidence and the heart to continue to do well and do good. We are uniquely positioned to serve the decadal shift that will favor our packages. We look forward to continuing our journey and returning value to our shareholders. We extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. And with that, Scott, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: Dan, can you talk a little bit more about the time frame for recovering the costs in Europe? It seems like there's been a difference in the pass-throughs in North America versus EMEA. I don't know if you could talk a little bit more about opportunities to kind of close that gap? Or were you just more impacted by sort of hardship clauses given the sharp rise in energy in Europe? Any more color you can give there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I'll give you a little high-level color and then maybe ask Scott to make some specific comments. One of the things is we did not experience a lot of inflation in Q1. It accelerated towards the tail end of the quarter. So it's a little bit more of what's yet to come versus what we've experienced. I will say how that plays into the cost recovery discussions that we initiated kind of November-December time frame with our customers is, those conversations have been going well, but we haven't secured 100% short-term pricing pass-through. As you can imagine, these conversations are ongoing. We're trying to make those as equitable as we can moving forward in the event that we're moving into a more -- more of a high inflation environment. So there's more work to do. And I think it would be safe to say that I don't think we anticipated the level of inflation that we're now seeing in Europe. There's more work to do, but our contracts are sound. We will get this back. Europe may look a little bit more like North America did last year and then transitioning into this year relative to the pass-through. But Scott, I don't know if there's anything additionally you would add to that.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Anthony, I would just say that going into this year, 90 days ago, we saw opportunity for nice improvement in growth and profitability in Europe in 2022. But with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and inflation and euro devaluation, I think it's going to be tough to make what we made last year, full year in Europe. On the inflation side -- and this takes into account, inflation is probably running $50 million higher than what we originally anticipated. And similar to last year in the U.S., to Dan's comment, we'll get this back in the following year or so. No doubt it's a headwind for this year. And you're seeing that we're getting it back in North America, like we expected, which is partly why the results in the first quarter are up so much given some volume growth but a little lower volume growth.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just shifting gears to Brazil. When you look at your volumes maybe versus what you were expecting at the beginning of the year, it seems like there's a few things going on with maybe consumer weakness and weather and maybe timing of Carnival. I think you indicated cans are holding share. Can you just kind of help bridge what's really driving the volume performance in Brazil and just kind of thoughts as we move into 2Q and back half of the year?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thanks for that. One thing that you did indicate, just to be clear on this, volume -- liquid volume was down 15%. And so plus or minus that number is kind of where we ended up in terms of volume decline, and a lot of that has to do with discretionary spending power in Brazil because all of the other countries surrounding in South America performed really much better than Brazil, Southeast Brazil, in particular. So I think rough math, what our colleagues in South America and Brazil specifically were telling us is your spending power was cut by 1/3 basically over the last three to four months. And on top of that, because these products are U.S.-denominated in terms of the aluminum profile of them our customers were passing through price on top of that, so you could see a 30% to 40% impact on an end consumers' buying power relative to a package in Brazil. The things that are going to be transitory relative to allowing recovery in the second half of the year and why we're a bit bullish on the back half of the year, in particular, a couple of things. Number one, it's an election year. It's an election year in Brazil. So what that means is there's a stimulus package coming. That will certainly help. You referenced in your question timing in and around Carnival. As we sit here today, we believe that there will be a carnival reflective of what you've seen in years past, a street carnival. Somewhere in July is what's being contemplated. And the last thing is there's a World Cup, and the World Cup sits in a different time slot than typically does. So a November World Cup we should see the benefits of that. And that's what our customers are certainly building and discussing with us. So I think you'll see a second half performance lift kind of versus where we anticipated. I don't know if that's all going to be able to make up for what we experienced in the first quarter. But I think there are plenty of things to point to that we'll see continued strong performance, not only in the extending surrounding South America countries, but in Brazil, in particular, where the decline was in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Just in terms of your comments on consumer mobility, just kind of increasing and of course, here in the U.S., especially, how do you see that impacting demand for packaged beverage more broadly? I know you said that the can is gaining share, but is that a headwind from a just a shift standpoint that you're just going to have to cycle through as an industry in 2022?
Dan Fisher: Ghansham, you're talking specifically about the on-premise versus trade.
Ghansham Panjabi: Exactly.
Dan Fisher: Yes. So what -- I guess we really weren't surprised by the returns to on-premise. Actually, I look at it slightly different than maybe the intonation of your question. I looked at it as positive that we were able to continue to grow share in can across all the substrates. And I think the other thing to keep in mind, especially in the Northern Hemisphere is, as our customers in the first quarter took price, they typically fight like heck in the peak season for volume and share. And so, I think we're going to learn a lot about that question specifically and in about our volume trajectories heading into peak season in the Northern Hemisphere. But the underlying performance relative to can share penetration, I'm optimistic about coming out of Q1, despite I mean some of the lower volume levels -- unit volume levels.
Ghansham Panjabi: Understood. And then in terms of aluminum, I mean, there's plenty of concern about aluminum availability, and many of the producers reported earnings over the last couple of weeks, and they have all these nice charts that show inventory levels very low, et cetera. Is that starting to affect your customers in terms of new product development as they sort of look at the supply chain and sort of want to de-risk away from aluminum supply issues, maybe not this year but certainly over the next couple of years? Or do you think the suppliers on the can sheet side are able to produce aluminum fast enough, just based on their own investments? How do you see that unfolding?
Dan Fisher: I think just the opposite. I think there's so much pressure on anti-plastic sentiment. So innovation conversations right now, Ghansham, they would be what's going to show up on the shelf in '24, '25 in terms of sort of new categories, new channels, new products. And those conversations are far more robust than they were a year ago. And as you already indicated, aluminum is back up a lot more expensive than it was a year ago. So let's see. Let's see how we get on. But I think the anti-plastic pressure and sentiment is beginning to be palpable for a couple of large CPG customers, and they see aluminum as a solution to some of these recycling content percent increases they're going to have to achieve.
Scott Morrison: And we're starting to see investment in the aluminum supply chain in North America. So I think that's encouraging.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Parkinson: Just when you take a step back and just look at the overall theme affecting aluminum bev can demand, there's been a lot of money being thrown still at ready-to-drink cocktails. I mean the sales and marketing budgets would suggest that those consumer companies are fully dedicated to that. There have been a lot of conversions and energy drinks and so on and so forth. When we look at the back half of the year and we look into 2023, what are the two or three things that you're most excited about? Has that changed given the current macro environment? And just how should The Street ultimately be thinking about that?
Dan Fisher: I would say your question highlights the areas that we're also bullish on. And then one is not necessarily innovation. It's just existing categories and existing channels that have plastic products. Plastic is our biggest opportunity, hands down. But I think ready-to-drink cocktails, I think energy always surprises us to the upside in terms of growth. We've got some really good partners there. Those are the couple of areas. And I think maybe not -- in terms of the back half of this year, but maybe bridging on my commentary from the previous question, there are some pretty significant categories with some pretty significant plastic that cans really don't play in that they will start to evolve in over time. So just about every kind of nutritional sports drink of some sort is basically in plastic, that's going to have to change, and I think there's opportunities there.
Chris Parkinson: So just as a corollary of that, essentially the exact question. I mean you have, in fact, seen efforts California, Colorado, New York, Miami Beach, regarding switching over from plastic to aluminum. Availability has actually been an issue for some of those initiatives. I mean a few airlines have discussed it. I mean, it doesn't seem like it's been a primary focus of the investment community quite yet. But do you have any updated thought process in terms of kind of the initial like knee-jerk action in some of those announcements? Obviously, they're small, but how easily would it be for any one of those to morph into something that could actually be material for your platform?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Great question, and thank you for drawing that out. I would say, if you look at airlines in particular, I can speak to that. They clearly have a sustainability challenge with the fuel. And so if they're going to get to some of their goals and objectives for the major airlines, one easy place to start is to get rid of plastic within -- when you're on-boarding the plane, when you're on the plane and when you're exiting the plane. And so we have not only single-use aluminum containers, though we have multiuse aluminum containers and we got cups. And we are having those conversations with airlines right now. And one, I think, has already announced in the Northwest that they're going to transition toward all aluminum. And so there are absolutely green shoots. And the first domino falls then it's a cascading effect, and then it starts to build on itself. So I think there's opportunity, certainly a lot of policy, a lot of shifts. We saw New Jersey trying to move away from styrofoam this summer, so that will be an opportunity set for our cups. And so these things are starting to build incrementally. And I think the entirety of our aluminum packaging portfolio will benefit from them, not just the beverage side. So thanks for that question.
Operator: Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
George Staphos: Thanks for the details. So I wanted to come back to the guidance question just to make sure that we all were appropriately level set. So your ability to hit the 10% to 15% and your ability to execute on your plans in Russia, basically, what you're saying is you can get into that range if you generate the capital that you can deploy from ultimately exiting Russia. Is that a fair summary? Or is that incorrect and anything that I stated?
Scott Morrison: George, you broke up a little bit there, but let me take a shot at it. Our ability to grow in that 10% to 15% range this year depends on how long we continue to operate. Right now, if we continue to operate at the current levels, we would expect to be in that 10% to 15% range for the remainder of the year. But we are -- that business makes $10 million, $11 million a month in operating earnings. So it's somewhat dependent upon that. And the timing under which a potential sale might happen, we're early in the process. These things, as you know, take time to execute. But it's an attractive business. It's a profitable business. We have a number of people that are -- a number of entities that are interested in it. And so, it's really based on the timing of when something might happen on that front.
George Staphos: Understood, Scott. And apologies for the breaking up on the phone. If you can hear me now, I thought perhaps it was you would ultimately close on some sort of move, which would give you proceeds that you could redeploy, which in turn would enable you to get to the 10 to 15, but it's really more about how long you can hold on to it in the course of the year. Is that right?
Scott Morrison: No, it's really both those things, George. So you're exactly right. It's really proceeds and what we do with those proceeds and conversely, how long we operate. So right, either of those ways would give us paths to that 10% to 15% potential.
Dan Fisher: And George, maybe Scott, you just want to comment on the $1.750 billion return to shareholder and how that's impacted by Russia or not.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Really, our plans are the same. We tend to not buy that much in the first quarter. We've got our working capital build. We tend to front-end-load our pension funding. So most of that happened in the first quarter, but obviously, given kind of the weakness in the share price, we expect to accelerate the return of value to shareholders here as we move through the rest of this year and out of the first quarter.
Dan Fisher: George, you've been following us. You know we're laser-focused on that number. The world is a little bit fluid right now, but we're going to be laser-focused on returning value to our shareholders.
George Staphos: Two other questions and I'll turn it over, mostly around volume growth. So I think the last quarter conference call, you were targeting roughly double-digit growth in North America. And correct me if I'm wrong, we started at a reasonable rate in excess of 3%. How does the start to the year affect your overall outlook? And why was it somewhat slower perhaps than what you were targeting for the year? And then of the initiatives that we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years that haven't yet materialized in size -- water, nutrition and the like -- have you signed any 1 billion unit plus contract at this juncture in many of these bigger categories? And why do you think they will manifest themselves in potentially a weaker macro environment when CPG companies will maybe prefer to hold on to some of their marketing dollars?
Dan Fisher: Great. Thanks, George. Let me -- maybe let me attack the last part of your question first. I think your comments relative to water, no significant appreciable contracts in and around either one of those categories. We won't go into specifics on customers or that. But no multibillion unit contracts have been secured on those two categories in particular. I think there's more opportunity on the category of sports drinks, nutrition, et cetera, because it's at a higher price point. And there's a significant amount of plastic involved in those products. So that's a win-win on a number of levels for some of our customers that candidly just have to get out of plastic and significant plastic-weighted products. I think water is going to take disruption. It's going to take a different package. It's going to take a different look and feel. But anti-plastic sentiment in some of the states, especially on the coast, is going to drive different behavioral patterns. It doesn't necessarily have to come out of our beverage business. It can come out of our impact extruded business. It can come out of our cups business. So we have avenues to play across the aggregate of our aluminum packaging space that may not show up in the billions of units here in the next 12 to 18 months. But we can do well during that time period on a number of fronts because of the aggregate nature of our product mix. You want to talk about the 3.4% growth first quarter?
Scott Morrison: Yes. And in North America, we still have a path to double-digit growth in North America. The first quarter was a little behind our internal expectations, and I can point to two things for that which make a lot of sense to me. Number one, our customers took up price a little bit more than we anticipated in the first quarter. And I think you've seen their earnings releases. They've all done extraordinarily well here in the first quarter. And the other thing, as we transitioned in North America into these new -- the new contract for our ability to pass through the inflation in arrears as we spoke to in Q4, I do think there was some incremental pull forward of cans into Q4 from some of our customers trying to beat that price increase from us. So I think that those two contributing, I don't know what the end result would have been in the quarter, but they would have -- we expected a little bit more than we actually delivered. And then we're excited about what we're seeing in terms of potential promotional activity in the second and the third quarter. That's when folks really start to fight for volume. And since our customers have gotten off to the start in terms of profit, I think they've got coffers full to do a little bit more aggressive work here in the second and the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mike Leithead: First, I want to circle back to George's first question, and I apologize for pressing here, but it's just an area we've heard a lot from investors in the past month. But I think your March press release talked about reducing operations immediately in Russia. So can you kind of square that with continuing to the sell cans? And obviously, Ball prides itself on being an ESG leader. So I guess, again, how do you square that with continuing to sell in Russia?
Scott Morrison: Well, let me start. We scale we scaled back, but we're still operating at about 90%. We're dealing with customers that are paying us basically upfront where the business can sustain itself from a cash standpoint. From an ESG standpoint, we have 950 employees that work for us in Russia. And we provide well-being for those people and those families. And so finding an orderly transition for that business, I think is exactly the right thing to do as an owner. And so that's what we're doing.
Mike Leithead: Great. And maybe...
Scott Morrison: It takes time to exit a business, and we're working on the sale of that business, but that's not something that's done in a week time or a month's time. Those things take a little bit of time. And given the difficulty of operating in that environment, it's probably going to take a little bit of time to execute on that. But we think that is the absolute right thing to do.
Mike Leithead: Fair enough. And then maybe just quickly for Scott on the cash flow. Obviously, 1Q is a seasonal working capital build, but it's a bit steeper this year. So just where would you expect working capital to shake out for the full year in your guidance?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think full year, there'll be a bit of a use of working capital, probably in the $150 million to $200 million range in total. First quarter, we intentionally built more inventory. We've been talking about the last couple of years kind of running hand-to-mouth in the summertime, and we wanted to avoid that. And so, we intentionally built more inventory in the first quarter. So that's the big chunk of it. And then we did about 80% to 90% of our pension funding for the full year in the first quarter. So those would be the big changes or the differences from last year.
Operator: And we have a question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. I guess First off, in Europe, could you just describe some of the energy inflation headwinds that you're experiencing, maybe if there's a dollar impact and how the contracts need to be restructured potentially to account for some of that headwind, if that's part of any initiatives as well?
Scott Morrison: Sure. Energy, in a number of markets in Europe, they are regulated. And so we can hedge about 65% of the markets where we operate. And so we do that. But when you have extraordinary spikes in certain markets where things didn't go up 3%, 4%, 5%, they went up 100 multiples, 7, 8x what they were, and it's like you're not hedged. So these bikes are typically short-lived, but they're impactful in the near term. And so we've seen extreme volatility at various times over the years in different commodities. If you get storms or a variety of things happen, it tends to revert back to some kind of mean pretty quickly. But when I mentioned that $50 million of inflation number, that's including energy, and we are working on contracts to better capture those things as we no doubt are entering into a more volatile world as we go forward. And so we'll have to contract appropriately to make sure that we have the right kind of pass-through mechanisms to get -- to recover that quickly.
Arun Viswanathan: Yes, that's okay. And understanding the market is pretty tight, I guess, and some of your competitors are going through re-contracting there. Do you see kind of an environment maybe when -- maybe into next year where that business kind of obviously, you may not necessarily be experiencing that right now, but that business kind of is a little bit higher returns profile, again, just given what's going on in the competitive environment?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I'm not entirely sure it's higher return profile, but we'll certainly catch up the inflationary headwinds that we have this year. Our business over the last four to five years has improved Keep in mind that metals pass-through, so that can dilute if you're looking at this on a return on sales percentage. But when we look at contribution margin and we look at actual dollars being generated, it's a very profitable gross profit business, and you can have a bit of a drag in periods like this where you have a spike in inflation, that's what we're experiencing, that's what we're communicating to you. But I think you'll get that back. next year. And if you return to some level of normalcy on inflation, you'll continue to see that two-in-one flow-through operating earnings versus unit sales growth. And that business is performing well. I'm actually quite pleased with the fact that despite everything that's happening right now, our business produced like-for-like earnings year-over-year. That's a testament to the quality of that leadership team, that management team and how they're able to operate in a pretty challenging environment.
Scott Morrison: Today, it's kind of on the margin percentage, be careful, metal is up 60% year-over-year. So that's going to really impact your margin percentage on sales. But we're very happy with the performance in total.
Operator: And we have another question from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Phil Ng: Sorry, just one more question on Europe. Appreciating your earnings will be down in Europe this year, just given the lag on inflation. But do you expect to make progress through the year as you kind of pursue these commercial efforts? And Russia aside when we think about 2023, should we get -- should your earnings kind of get back to 2011 levels?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think as we move through the year, we're still early in the year. So we got to wait and see how the summer season shows up in Europe and how volumes show up. But yes, we would expect a nice improvement as we kind of move through the year. And again, all these comments kind of absent Russia because that's a bit of [unknown]. As we get to -- FX is again a bit of a drag. But if you look at it on an FX adjusted basis, we were up 7.5% in the first quarter. But on a dollars basis, it was flat. So FX could be a bit of a drag as we look through the year.
Dan Fisher: And Phil, on the cost recovery question, we are having conversations. They're ongoing. Our customers know that this needs to be equitable. These are unique times and circumstances. And so yes, depending on the outcome of those conversations, we could do a little better than what Scott indicated as we sit here today and what we know is in front of us in terms of contractual language.
Phil Ng: Okay. That's super. And then from a Russia standpoint, they're obviously a big exporter of raw materials, including aluminum. Any supply chain risk and availability of material that we should be mindful of?
Scott Morrison: Not really. I mean Russia was really, for us, is kind of a self-contained business, and there wasn't a lot of aluminum going in other places. Russia is a global supplier of aluminum. But right now, we're not seeing any more supply chain challenges that we've been facing in the last year or so.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mike Roxland: Dan, Scott, just a quick question on -- with respect to your Russian greenfield plant, is there any change that you're still liable for. So let's assume that you're able to sell the business next week or two, hypothetical, equipment order, any contracts you've entered into? Is there anything that we should be mindful of that you still will be liable for if you're able to -- once you sell that business?
Scott Morrison: No. No, we stopped -- as we mentioned, the Russian greenfield has been stopped. No equipment had been put in country yet anyway. So the dial down in CapEx is in part due to Russia. I would say majority due to Russia. And then anything else, we're moving to other places where we still need capacity. So there's no additional drag because of that.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think the important comment there, I think you heard it, but they're -- we're growing everywhere. So there are opportunities to redeploy the capital, those lines in particular. And so, we're just evaluating the prioritization list right now, but kind of excited where we could potentially deploy those assets.
Mike Roxland: Got it. That makes sense. And just one quick follow-up on supply chain food raw materials. Dan, you mentioned in your comments about supporting U.S. production of aluminum can sheet. How is the availability of aluminum can sheet for your greenfield plants? And given your comments, is there any concern that you have that is continue to grow we might not have the can sheet you need, so you're looking to diversify suppliers and to expand who you operate with work there?
Dan Fisher: So I think we might be having some technical difficulties. I heard most of what you said. It's a little choppy on this in. But let me talk about some additional commentary on my scripted comments as it relates to the U.S. domestic supply. We've been really consistent that the market is tight. We're still importing from various parts around the world, mostly China, some from the Middle East but still coming in to support domestic growth. As we sit here today, looking out three to four years, it becomes increasingly tight, but there's a path to get aluminum to support the growth that we've announced. There are going to be additional investments, some pretty significant that we believe are going to start to show up. And you'll hear more about those in coming days and weeks. So we see really good line of sight, and we'll talk about it more at our Investor Day, heading out into 2030. And that's probably about as far as we can look right now with any kind of level of conviction with our customers. But we're in a much better place in terms of the opportunity set that's in front of us and the level of commitment from the supply base than we were a couple of years ago. It was starting to be a little bit concerning for us. And I think it's far less of an issue when you look at the Pareto of challenges to keep pace with the growth in the supply chain, We're in a far better position as we sit here today.
Operator: And we have a question from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Angel Castillo: Dan, just a quick one, I guess, in terms of the North American market. You talked about maybe 2Q, 3Q being a little bit stronger. But as we think about maybe the pull forward of those in 4Q, 1Q, some of the trade trends in North America perhaps coming in a little bit below your expectations, are you back in terms of inventories back to where you want to be in terms of a normal environment? And how do you kind of see imports in North America shipment growth for the full year in terms of percentage and the absolute value for imports?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I can comment probably more on the trends that we're seeing and the quality of the inventory. The -- as we sit here today, we're in a much better position than we were a year ago. I will tell you that there's the aggregate inventory position that looks good, and then we still have can sizes that are incredibly tight and short, and we're going to have to manage through some of those aspects, but we're in a far better position as we step into Q2 and Q3. And that's really when you reflect back on the challenges that we might have had last year. In the Northern Hemisphere in particular, it was a tough go there for about six or eight weeks in Q2 and the first half of Q3.
Scott Morrison: I think imports in total, you're going to see down, but remember, those import numbers, they always include Mexico which will be a consistent flow of Mexican beer into the United States.
Dan Fisher: One other comment, it was in the script. As it relates to some of our other joint ventures and our assets that we're exporting cans into the U.S., we're now exporting cans into other parts of the world, Europe, in particular. So the exports are still happening, but they may be showing up in other parts of the world because we've sort of leaned into the North America investments a little bit more than the time line of investments for Europe and for South America. And so as those foundational assets get put into place into Europe and South America, you might have to -- those regions may have to import a bit. Nothing to the extent of what we experienced in North America, but that's sort of how we're looking at the import/export world right now.
Angel Castillo: Got it. That's very helpful. And then as you think about the capacity additions, I think at your last Investor Day, you had laid out the kind of totals of in two phases of potential capacity additions, a good portion of which has been announced. But as you think about perhaps what hasn't been announced or hasn't been fully constructed yet outside of the Russia plant that you've already discussed. I guess, any changes based on what we're seeing in this environment, the uncertainty as to how quickly you want to deploy that capital, how quickly you want to build or perhaps the mix as well as you kind of alluded to between regions? Just how is that kind of decision -- the capital deployment decision evolving?
Dan Fisher: Yes. We're always going to follow EVA. And so as that picture evolves, some of the assets may end up in a different place than we had originally anticipated back at the end of 2020. The good news is all of the growth, medium and long-term growth projections that we gave, they're still there for us, which is four years on from when we -- or three years on from when we made those comments. We're a little ahead at this stage in terms of the capital that we deployed and the unit volume that we've installed. And I think your comment is right. I mean the world is a pretty volatile place right now. And so there may be opportunities that present themselves that look different than they were a couple of years ago. And if we get the right terms and conditions with our customers, we get contracted volume and we get a good EVA return, we're going to deploy it to those areas.
Operator: We have a question from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mark Wilde: Scott, I wondered if you could just give us any color on getting cash and getting capital out of Russia. I know it's hard in the middle of the situation to get too granular, but just any color would be helpful.
Scott Morrison: I mean our historical profit have already been dividended out of Russia. So we don't really have much sitting in Russia other than our assets that are there. And so there's no there's not like a bunch of trapped cash or anything like that. And so we'll have to see as we go through the process and the regulatory approval as to what that looks like, and that will play into our decision as to ultimately what we do.
Mark Wilde: And then just the sale proceeds, the expected sale proceeds?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I mean we're -- like I said, we're early in the process, and we'll update you as we get more information.
Mark Wilde: Okay. But do you see any issues in a prospective sale in getting the capital out of the country?
Scott Morrison: There are a variety of ways in which you can structure sales. So I'll just leave it at that.
Mark Wilde: Okay. All right. That's good. And then, Dan, just turning to the North American beverage can business. Can you give us some sense of where you're running from a kind of a manufacturing efficiency standpoint and sort of gains -- further gains that we may see as you move through the year with the ramp-up of new capacity and then into '23?
Dan Fisher: Yes. You broke up a little there. I think your question was in and around operational performance and the ability to improve. I can tell you in North America, in particular, what I was most excited about the results here in the first quarter was the performance in North America. Aerospace did wonderfully as well. So we're seeing some stability in those two businesses that, quite candidly, we haven't seen for the last 12 to 18 months. I think those will start to build on themselves. We will get to a better asset utilization framework where we're not oversold, hopefully. And with that in tow and the management team with new contracts, new terms and conditions, a clearer line of sight in terms of supply chain, more efficient ability to run our plants, you should see continued incremental benefits and the learning curve. The learning curve in areas like spoilage, like M&R, those things are costly line items when you're starting up a plant, and we're seeing nice progression in all of those new assets. And so I'm pretty bullish that the earnings profile regardless of whether we're 10% growth or 8% growth, I think you're going to like the results coming out of that business moving forward because we've been really honest. We haven't necessarily been what we expected here the last couple of years. And I think we've got our arms around a really good team in place there, and we're going to get after that here in the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Curtis Woodworth: First question just around the tightness in the can sheet substrate market, obviously, conversion fees for that product are going up. So I just wonder if you could speak to your alignment with respect to pricing those contracts against your new capacity ramp and whether you would have any interest in potentially partnering or funding some of the upstream capacity going forward.
Dan Fisher: Yes. It's certainly tight. It's been tight. It will continue to be. Our supply base is making incremental investments or have the last four or five years in debottlenecking. And I think everyone believes in the growth at this point, maybe not everyone believe to the extent they needed to, to cut a $2 billion check, which is sort of ballpark what's required to build a new rolling mill. Those are going to start to happen. And we will participate in those, as you can imagine, as the industry leader. And the form of participation will vary. And you'll -- we'll speak more to that in particular as those announcements become public.
Curtis Woodworth: Okay. Understood. And then just with respect to -- you kind of said that the CPG companies are feeling, I think, more palpable pressure around conversion recyclability and getting away from plastic. I mean it seems like the past several years, they've been moving in that direction pretty clearly. But are you seeing an acceleration in the thought process there, and then given the fact that you already have substantial capacity backlog through end of '24 at this point, do you feel like there's still decent interest level and bidding activity for new plants beyond that time frame? Do you feel like the CPG companies are kind of pausing with respect to digesting some of the capacity announcements that we've seen?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I believe it's more pointed. What you've seen is incremental shifts. And I think what we -- the conversations now are beginning to be category shifts of where cans aren't participating today. And so that -- those are multiyear discussions, you've got to have the supply chain not just on our side but on their side, right? If they're going to shift out of plastic into cans in a big way, they're going to have to make those investments. And so you start having conversations that are in the time frame that you alluded to much earlier and with much more intentionality. And so that's what gives me a great deal of confidence that this is -- we're early innings here still. And so yes, stay tuned.
Operator: We have a question from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kyle Deutsche: In South America, if Brazil remains weak and doesn't rebound quite like you may expect in the balance of the year, is there an opportunity to export some of your production and cans elsewhere in South America? Did you do some of that this quarter? Or are those regions such as Argentina, Paraguay and Chile, are they already balanced from a supply demand standpoint? Just trying to -- just trying to understand any potential offsets you may have if Brazil remains weak here.
Dan Fisher: Yes, thanks for that. I think Brazil is our biggest business by a pretty significant amount. And so material offsets in the short term, I don't think those are significant. And having said that, we are constantly supporting other areas of growth, and so those will begin to accelerate, I think, the tail end of Q3 and Q4 with World Cup, et cetera. So yes, if there's an inflection point or you don't see the robust pickup in volume that we're candidly expecting and our customers, more importantly, are expecting then -- and some of those customers, they all participate in these other countries. So we'll work with them and we can ship product and take advantage of other areas within the country or adjoining countries for growth.
Kyle Deutsche: Got it. And one on the aluminum...
Dan Fisher: And where we are right now, I mean maybe we're feeling a little bit more confident than you are because we are already starting to see a little bit more growth here in April and the early parts of May, even with all of the things that I outlined previously. So, I think you're starting to return to a little bit more normal shipment patterns for various reasons. And so, I don't think we're going to be needing to pull the levers that you indicated, but let's see.
Kyle Deutsche: Sounds good. And then on the aluminum cups business, can you just provide kind of an update here as events are definitely coming back. I think you previously targeted being profitable by the end of this year for that business. But I'm really just kind of curious based on the customer discussions that you've had and kind of this early runway that you've had, how big of a business or earnings contribution do you think aluminum cups could be five years from now?
Dan Fisher: Five years from now, my goodness. If you asked me if we were going to be in a land war in Europe 90 days ago, I would have said that's crazy. No, I appreciate that you ask. I think this business has a really good opportunity to exit the year with a profitable trajectory in lens heading into next year. The venues are open. The importance of the second line coming on board is 9.1 ounce cups and 12 ounce. We need the entire aggregate portfolio to get to the volume levels across all of the products that our customers want to sell. So that's going to tell us a lot. We are going to be in a number of retailers, every single retail outlet that they own. We're going to see that this summer. That's also going to give us more indication to better answer that question. It's the right question. We're asking the same one ourselves. We're still very bullish as we sit here today on the business. We're going to be in a number of test markets and trials. We're starting to see things like styrofoam cups being regulated. That wasn't in our thought process, even this time a year ago. So, there's more room for opportunity in green shoots than there was this time a year ago. But we're going to have to see how we get on here this summer and how some of these tests go before I can really even indicate what '23, '24 and '25 look like. Scott, we're a couple of minutes over. Maybe we take one more question.
Operator: Okay. We have a question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Samuelson: I appreciate you squeezing me in. Maybe just thinking about North America and coming off of the first quarter where the volume shipments maybe weren't as maybe were a little bit light of where you had previously thought. And can you talk about where your product inventories are today? I think if I'm going back to last year and last summer, that was an area of real stress in the supply chain because your finished product inventories were very tight. And is that something that gives you real confidence about the summer and the peak drink season here that you can serve the customers in a way that might have been tougher and operationally more complex a year ago?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Thank you. We're definitely in a better spot than we were a year ago. And in the North America business, probably more so than any other one, depending on what our customers want to do from a mix perspective and a category perspective, what they want to promote. We may or may not have the right mix, but it's a heck of a lot more healthy, and it's going to give us a lot of ability to manage and execute. We exited 2021 in incredibly low levels, and we -- Q1 was tough. Q2 was tough. Q3 was tough as a result. I think our improved performance in Q1 should give you some belief -- it certainly does for us -- that we're in a better position to manage our business in a more proactive manner. And hopefully, that transitions throughout the balance of the year. But there's still an element of mix here that we have to keep our eye on, specifically in North America.
Adam Samuelson: Okay, that's really helpful. I'll pass on. Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us, and we'll get on in the second quarter and look forward to talking to you again soon. Scott, was there anybody left in the queue?
Operator: No, not at this moment.
Dan Fisher: Thank you
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation 4Q 2021 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 27, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, Malika, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company's news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President and CEO Elect; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some introductory remarks; Dan will discuss our company's performance and trends; Scott will discuss the key financial metrics, and then we'll finish up with closing comments. 2021 was a strong year for Ball. We exited the year with momentum and expect another strong year in 2020. Our global beverage can volumes were up 7%, aerospace revenues were up 10%. Comparable operating earnings increased 12% and comparable diluted earnings per share increased 18% despite ongoing challenges related to the pandemic, adverse weather events, global supply chain disruptions and higher costs. We also increased EVA dollars over 7%, returned approximately $950 million to shareholders after investing over $1.7 billion in capital expenditures in 2021. For the fourth quarter global beverage can volumes increased 7%, comparable operating earnings increased 17%, and comparable diluted earnings per share were up 20% versus 2020 despite persistent dunnage shortages and cool rainy conditions during the Brazil seasonal summer, which muted overall shipment growth in the fourth quarter and the full-year. As we look forward, we expect growth to accelerate further supported by strong demand for sustainable aluminum packaging, aerospace executing on significant contracted backlog, reefing returns on capital deployed, and maintaining pricing leverage across our innovative and sustainable product portfolio. Yesterday in addition to declaring our quarterly dividend and following our review of the company's governance profile, our board of directors amended the company's bylaws to accomplish three things. One, to opt out of the classified board structure required by Indiana Business Corporation Law in order to begin to destagger our board; two, to prevent shareholders to amend the bylaws; and three, to increase the board retirement age to 75 years from 72 years. As per the press release we issued yesterday, the board intends to recommend shareholders approved the amendments at our 2022 shareholders meeting, and more information will be found in the forthcoming proxy statement. In addition, and as part of a multi-year succession planning process that began before the onset of the COVID pandemic, we announced that Dan Fisher will be assuming the role of CEO and then I'll remain Chairman. Dan is ready, and all of us on the board have a high degree of confidence in his ability to lead our great company. Dan will be the 12th person in our 142 year history to have the privilege to serve as Ball's CEO. Going forward I’m handing over the reins to Dan to lead the company and after 70 earnings and M&A calls with the investment community over my 20 plus years with Ball, today will be my last one. You're in great hands going forward. And I can also say with confidence that while I will miss you all I will not miss these calls.  My time going forward will be spent sharing the board and its related responsibilities, helping Dan on our sustainability advocacy work with various stakeholders, burling in on the philanthropic work that my wife Susie and I have established, spending more time with family and friends, and perhaps most importantly, being the biggest cheerleader of this great institution. Thanks to each of you for your support over these years. This is an amazing company in an amazing industry working with and in conjunction with amazing people. If you were to give me a clean sheet of paper to design the most ideal job in the world, it would be this and I'm the luckiest person in the world for that. And it is time, Dan has proven that he is ready and has an excellent management team to continue and accelerate the strong financial, operational and cultural performance we have experienced not only since 2010, but indeed since 1999 when I joined the company. When I reflect on becoming CEO the bar was set very high then into me our Drive for 10 vision was intended to replicate or exceed the prior decades performance and returns over the following decade. And you know what? We did just that. And at the same time, as we sit here today, we have more opportunities to continue this growth than we did in 2010. And there's never been a better opportunity set then the company has in front of itself. However, what will be required to capitalize on those opportunities going forward; will no doubt be different than what was required in the past. There will of course be challenges Dan and the team will face, but the leadership, the culture, the people, our EVA and ownership mindset, and our Drive for 10 vision will be there to support and guide Dan and team just to say were there for me and team. Right now, I also think about the more than 24,000 employees around the world. The power of we not me at all is alive and real. And it has been an honor to serve our company alongside them. They really are what makes the company better each and every day. Those aren't just words, it's the truth. So it's with great pride and optimism that I turn the call over to Dan and Scott, to speak to our performance and the outlook for 2022 and beyond. Thank you, everyone. And with that, our new incoming CEO, Dan Fisher. Dan?
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. I would be remiss if I didn't properly and publicly thank John Hayes for his 22 years of service to Ball Corporation, and for his personal support, and mentorship of me as a leader at Ball. Some of you may have listened to nearly all of the 70 earnings and deal-related investor calls John has participated on during his tenure. As you know, John dedicated his time to ensuring the company remained committed to its longstanding culture. EVA and ownership mindset and high ethics, while also being innovative, inclusive, sustainability-driven, and positioning our business for global growth, while also supporting our communities where we live and operate and generating great returns for fellow shareholders. We as owners and students of Ball in our industries are better off, because of his leadership and dedication. We'll forever be indebted to you, John. The performance and stock price development under your leadership speak for themselves. And while it is indeed a team sport here at Ball, John was the team captain for the past decade. John, thank you for setting a high bar for us. I can assure you that speaking on behalf of all Ball employees; we're focused on replicating and/or exceeding the company's performance under your leadership. Another decade with nearly 500% return sounds pretty good. Our team is up to the task. I'm humbled and honored to assume the role of CEO and carry on the Ball culture, Drive for 10 vision, EVA discipline, and ownership mindset. And as the same goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. We know who we are. We know where we're going. And we know what is important. Now on to reviewing our performance and outlook. We continue to strive to keep our team safe and educated about vaccinations and boosters and focused on their mental health. We're not immune to the external forces impacting the global operating environment. However, our teams are doing a heck of the job at navigating those external forces and filling in for one another when needed. We extend our well wishes to our employees, customers, suppliers, stakeholders and everyone listening today. 2021 was another year where our Ball team and businesses faced challenges and through it all rose to the occasion to care for one another and deliver value to our stakeholders. In 2021, our business highlights included our global beverage business completing the startup of four new multi-line facilities, three in North America, one in South America and the expansion of existing facilities across all regions. The company also announced five additional Greenfield facilities, two in North America, and three in EMEA, which will come online in 2022 and beyond. Our global aluminum aerosol team introducing new re-closable aluminum bottles for personal care and other categories. Our aluminum cups team signed contracts with the world's largest retailer and continue to have our cup featured at key sporting events and venues. Our aerospace team expanding its infrastructure, opening its state-of-the-art payload development facility in Broomfield, Colorado, expanding our aerospace manufacturing center in Westminster, Colorado, as well as successfully launching the Ball-built OLI land imaging instrument on NASA's Landsat 9 satellite, the XV astrophysics mission spacecraft in the Optics and Mirror Systems aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. Our North America aluminum packaging business continuing progress towards aluminum stewardship initiative certification, following South America's ASI certification in the fourth quarter of 2021, and EMEA's ASI certification in 2020. The company also announced the Ambitious 2030 sustainability goals, including inclusion and diversity goals, recycling goals, and our aspiration to achieve net zero before 2050. Our businesses hired over 2,600 people in 2021 to support our long-term growth and attrition largely due to retirements and returning approximately $950 million to shareholders after investing $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to generate additional profitable growth for decades to come. In 2021, our global packaging businesses absorbed $120 million of non-aluminum inflationary headwinds and additional costs of startup for new facilities. Also, in North America, EMEA and South America, operational efficiencies, price costs squeeze and advance of contractual cost recovery and geopolitical volatility respectively, resulted in loss to reduction and money was left on the table in 2021. As we embark on 2022 contractual price escalators based on PPI and other indices, which phase in throughout the year, normal cost pass-throughs and our additional commercial cost recovery program benefits will generate significant incremental value and support higher levels of growth capital in 2022, which Scott will discuss later. Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the world. We shipped 112.5 billion cans in 2021, 50% were specialty cans and we exited 2021 with 12 billion units of new installed capacity. We also have plans in place to exit 2022 with another 12 billion units of new installed capacity. Capacity available to sell through in 2023 and beyond, announced projects in line additions in existing facilities all underscore our late 2020 Investor Day commentary and additional long-term EVA generating contracts for committed volumes are now in place to domestically supply our customers in the regions where we operate in 2022 and beyond. In addition to global beverage, our aerospace aluminum aerosol and cups teams continue to win new work and position and train talent to support multi-year growth and offset attrition largely due to retirements. To all the teams listening, thank you for finishing the year strong and leaning into another year of growth. We also appreciate your efforts to operationalize and commercialize sustainability, drive our D&I goals and live the Ball culture. As we discuss throughout 2021, growth isn't always linear. We continue to rely on our supply chain raw material inputs and look forward to additional investments being announced in 2022 to enable more growth for aluminum packaging. Given our established global scale, significant increase in installed capacity exiting 2021, our capable asset base and innovative product portfolio we're on course to achieve double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% for full-year 2022 and sold out market conditions continuing beyond 2022. Now a few brief comments on each region. In North America beverage fourth quarter shipped volumes were up 5% and versus 2020 fourth quarter excuse me -- fourth quarter 2019 volumes were up 16%. During the fourth quarter, earnings were up nearly 17% as volume growth specialty mix, and the operational benefit of better finished goods inventory levels, more than offset higher cost and operational efficiencies and legacy plants brought about by dunnage tightness and indirect supply chain disruptions. Glendale and Pittston exited 2021 with four can manufacturing lines installed and each have room for additional lines. Our Bowling Green Ins manufacturing plant started up successfully early in the quarter and continues to operate after incurring some roof damage during the December South Eastern U.S. tornado outbreak. We are thankful our Bowling Green team and their families are safe. The plants teams leadership safety actions and post event resiliency were outstanding. The business continues to work to build adequate inventory levels is ongoing. These actions formulate contractual price increases, higher levels of domestically produced cans, and cost recovery will further position the plants and our business for strong double-digit growth in 2022. Ball's previously announced multi-line Greenfield plants in Nevada and North Carolina are supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers and are on track to come online in late 2022 and early 2024 respectively. In EMEA, shipment volume for the fourth quarter was up 6% versus 2020 on tougher comps given prior-year's 20% volume increases due to COVID reopening timing, and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. Near double-digit growth in 2022 will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and available cans from our 2021 line additions and speed ups across the region. In 2023 and beyond, our new Greenfield plants in the UK, Russia, and Czech Republic, which are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key partners will extend our ability to serve growing customers and categories. Our EMEA team is executing very well in managing complex country-by-country supply chain issues. Key inputs are in tight supply, and though we have contracts and mechanisms to control costs, we're keeping a watchful eye on driver availability and pandemic-related labor shortages impacting timely stocking in store shelves. In South America, fourth quarter volumes were up 3% versus 2020 and up 16% versus 2019. 2020 volumes were up 12% versus fourth quarter 2019 due to timing effects related to COVID rebound and warmer temperatures during the seasonal summer fourth quarter. Cooler than normal seasonal temperatures and excessive rain in Brazil contributed to softer than anticipated volumes during the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to see more earnings upside in South America in 2022 and beyond. The Frutal Brazil plant start-up its second line during the first quarter of 2022. Additional investments throughout the region continue to be on schedule. In summary, our global beverage team is preparing ourselves and our supply chains for long-term durable growth while managing notable volatility. Our customers are continuing to lean on the can as their package of choice, as brand proliferation and the blurring of the category lines accelerates. We are operating safely controlling the things we can control, recovering costs, delivering high quality cans to our customers and even more new facilities supported by equitable contracts and closely monitoring global supply chains. Our aluminum aerosol team did a good job supplying growth across North America. The team continues to manage varying degrees of consumer demand volatility in Brazil and India. The business continues to make progress on the rollout of refillable reclosable aluminum personal care and bottle packaging across multiple categories. To support the new cups contracts I mentioned early, we have increased marketing investments and are adding another cup manufacturing line in our Rome, Georgia cups plant. Following this investment, both lines will be capable of making multiple cup sizes. We anticipate profit starting in late 2022. And turning to aerospace, the team continued to win contracts and maintain record backlog. Segment operating earnings were up 38% in the fourth quarter versus 2020 supported by improved program execution. Carrying in the momentum from the fourth quarter, the business continues to be positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2022 and margin improvement in 2022 given the contract mix. Across all our operations, we are increasing year-over-year capital in training investments to deliver on strong contracted demand and position our plant operations for success. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done across the organization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Dan and John, I couldn't be happier for both of you. Congratulations, John. Thank you, first and foremost for your friendship and for everything you've done for Ball. It's been a hell of a lot of fun. And thank you for your continued thought leadership on sustainability going forward. Dan, I'm very happy for you, your family and for Ball. This is a great day. You're a great leader and ready for this role. I look forward to us continuing to work together. I have one word of advice for John. Work on your putting. When you don't have the CEO title, you're much less likely to be given those three foot putts. And now to the numbers. Fourth quarter 2021 comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.97 versus $0.81 in 2020, an increase of 20% and comparable full-year 2021 diluted earnings per share are up 18%. Fourth quarter and full-year sales were up due to pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher sales volumes, and improved mix. Comparable fourth quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in North America, aerospace and other non-reportable, and lower year-over-year corporate cost during the quarter offset by unfavorable Euro earnings translation. In addition, the Ball and Platinum Equity announced sale of the Ball Metalpack investment closed yesterday. As a minority partner, Ball's net proceeds from yesterday's transactions were approximately $300 million. The sale represents the final step involves two step exit from the tin-plate steel food and aerosol businesses. Recall that Ball received approximately $600 million in cash proceeds in 2018, but our legacy steel food and aerosol assets were sold into the minority owned JV with Platinum. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. Year-end net debt to comparable EBITDA was 3.4 times and within our optimal leverage range. As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2022. Our full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 19%. Full-year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million and full-year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable is expected to be in the range of $120 million to reflect higher year-over-year incentives based on anticipated higher performance and investments to our systems infrastructure to support our robust growth. At this time, and given additional growth projects in all of our businesses to support EVA enhancing contracted volumes, we expect 2022 total CapEx to be at least $2 billion and to return in the range of $1.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in 2022. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. And look forward to even more opportunities to invest in our businesses for profitable returns. Rest assured, Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners and through the lens of EVA discipline, we will prudently balance growth opportunities with consist return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We look forward to consistently investing in our business and returning even more value to shareholders in the coming years. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, again, Scott. In summary, our Drive for 10 vision continues to serve as our guide. We know who we are, we know where we're going, and we know what is important. We are positioned to exceed both our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15%, as well as our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2022 and beyond. While we are not immune in facing inflation, volatility and supply chain headwinds in the near-term, we are confident that we will get through it successfully and maintain our pricing leverage. Over our 142-year history, it has been done before, and it will be done again. The decadal shift that will favor our packages is happening. We look forward to continuing our journey and being close to our customers, focusing on attention to detail, acting like true owners of the business, being good corporate citizens to our people and our planet and returning value to our shareholders. And with that, Malika, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first phone question is on the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Good morning and congratulations on incredible career John and good luck in all your future endeavors, and also to you, Dan, congratulations, on your new role as CEO.
Dan Fisher: Thank you. 
Christopher Parkinson: I just -- I was just wondering if you could just parse out a little bit more the volume trends by region and specifically you discussed some headwinds in South Americans weather-related impacts, in the fourth quarter, I think in North America on overall earnings, when we think about 2022 and some of those headwinds, maybe not recurring, how should we think about that demand progressing throughout the year?
Dan Fisher: Yes, great. Maybe I'll start with kind of how we're seeing 2022 and the growth by the three large regions. Commented in my prepared remarks, and as you know, we've installed quite a bit of the $12 billion capacity that's exiting 2021 is in North America. So you would expect, and that's what we anticipate double-digit growth in that region. In Europe, we've made a lot of incremental investments. And so we think that that team will be able to deliver near double-digit growth. And in South America, we anticipate we've commented on the 4% to 6% long-term growth trajectory. We anticipate being north of the -- or in the higher range of that. And in all total, I mean, we've got a really strong chance to get to double digits in the global beverage business with the capacity we've installed and the demand profile and the execution. A little bit more commentary in and around South America. We were just talking to that team the other day. I mean, keep in mind, in the fourth quarter, I think in Brazil, in particular, that's really where we had some demand disruption versus sort of what we anticipated ending in the quarter. I think the rain in Brazil was up something like 300% versus a normal rainfall estimate. And then there were a lot -- that's their peak season, and COVID started to show up in November and December and they shut down a lot of opportunities for folks to congregate and get together and consumed can beverages. So those were the two fundamental issues that precipitated in Brazil. The good news and why we were able to deliver growth is we're -- we play in a lot more areas and countries in that region than in Brazil. And so that's what trended us toward growth is, we had a really nice performance in a number of the other countries that we participate in. As we sit here today, COVID still persists. And so we're obviously monitoring it. It is peak season. The rain has stopped. The weather has improved. Those things are moving in a direction for South America, but we need to get beyond, what the entire world's dealing with relative to Omicron to see us return to kind of what we should anticipate normally in the first quarter in South America.
Christopher Parkinson: All right. No, that's extremely helpful. And then just a really quick one, obviously, whether it's been supply chain logistics, raw materials, a lot of people have been dealing with higher costs. And I think you mentioned you initiated additional cost recovery mechanisms throughout the quarter. If we assume that this persists a little bit longer into, let's say the first half of next year. Can you just discuss a little bit more what those actions are in terms of your cost recovery actions and any additional leverage you can take to help offset this in the near term?
Dan Fisher: Yes, thanks for that. So one thing, to keep in mind is, we didn't make this as clear -- we're doing it in all of our businesses. So that's one thing that wasn't maybe as clear, when we commented on this plan of attack at the last earnings call. The teams are fundamentally going out and having conversations in a Ball fashion with each one of our major customers. And so we're sitting at the table as partners and we're having those conversations. And I would say the feedback at this point overwhelmingly is we've made really good progress. We will see that improvement in 2022. One of the things you're pointing out is those conversations start with a point of view on what the world looks like. And so two months ago, I don't think anybody anticipated what was on and energy prices for instance, and the Ukraine impact. So we will have to have ongoing conversations as things in the world show up that none of us have anticipated or modeled, but the team's done a really nice job. And I think we're working toward a really nice plan and we should see that show up in 2022.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matt Krieger: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is actually Matt Krieger sitting in for Ghansham. First off, congratulations to John and Dan, on the announced elections and transition yesterday. I just dive-in right into -- just dive-in right into my first question here. Can you provide us with an update on some of the key growth categories across the beverage can market, with a particular emphasis on some of the categories that may have seen some choppiness over the past year -- years, so such as, as hard seltzer and other product, it seems like there's plenty of new introductions and momentum elsewhere, but if we could get some details on that that would be great.
Dan Fisher: Sure. And I'll attempt to parse out some of this by region. I would say globally, energy drinks are on fire. And we have a -- we have a very strong position with a number of those folks. And so we've benefited from that in terms of our growth profile. Beer continues to grow across the world. But I'd say we saw an inflection of CSD as well in Europe. And we have a strong position there. In South America, all of the growth was fundamentally muted by weather patterns, but again, beer is the dominant player there. So growth happens in -- growth happens or doesn't happen as a result of beer in South America. In North America, in particular, we saw growth in CSD, double-digit growth in energy, sparkling water, slight growth, domestic beer was down. Hard seltzers were down slightly. And craft beer was down slightly. But the largest category CSD and energy kind of for us and our portfolio did well. And that's what sort of carried today for us in North America.
Matt Krieger: Great, that's helpful. And then can you talk a bit about how free cash flow is expected to evolve in 2022? Maybe bridge 2021 to 2022 and then can you comment on some of the challenges or hurdles that you have to get over in deploying over $2 billion of capital in an environment that is increasingly marred by labor shortages and disruptions and kind of absenteeism? Some detail there would be great.
Scott Morrison: Sure. On the free cash flow front, we actually did a little better in 2021 than we expected, we had some milestone payments that we collected really from our aerospace business that helped us. Also if, when commodity prices rise, when aluminum rises, we get a benefit from a working capital standpoint, because we have longer payable terms than we have receivable terms. And so that helped working capital in 2021. In 2022, we're kind of expecting relatively flat commodity prices and expecting free cash flow to be or working capital to be relatively neutral. As it relates to deploying the capital, our teams have done a fantastic job of all the new builds, all the incremental lines that we put in plants, on time, on schedule, there's a slip here or there for maybe a week or so. But I have to commend our operating folks; they have done a spectacular job. Despite all the challenges, despite the COVID challenges, despite the supply chain challenges, they've really done an excellent job. So it's not without challenges. But I think we have a really good plan as to how we're going to deploy this $2 billion of capital. And we expect the strong performance operating performance to continue.
Dan Fisher: One build on Scott's comments relative to the execution of deployment. Remember, three, four years ago, what we decided to do was create a global engineering organization. And so we have the ability to deploy resources, not region dependent, but where the work needs to be done. And that team has done a remarkable job of organizing itself, standardizing installed base, I think we got upfront of the process equipment by, I think there's been a lot of things that we've done right over an extended period of time that are now showing up. And you can't underestimate the fact that we're hiring people well in advance. We're training them, when they come in, they know what to do. They feel safe, operating in our environments. And I think that's enabled us to retain people, far in excess of kind of what the industrial manufacturing sector is doing. So knock on wood. We're really encouraged about what we've done. And it's a really good building block and gives us a great deal of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to do that over the next 24 months.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. And congratulations to John for everything you've accomplished and to Dan as well. Dan you talked about adding 12 billion cans this year after adding 12 billion last year. From a big picture perspective, can you walk through your major regions and maybe just discuss, which might require imports this year and are extremely tight versus maybe regions where your supply situation might be getting maybe more comfortable or more normal?
Dan Fisher: The 2021 capacity and you could -- it's probably reflected in my commentary for where we see growth in 2022 was overwhelmingly in North America. We did put in a Greenfield facility in South America we'll see the benefits of that. And we did incremental investments in both South America and EMEA. But transitioning in 2022, there will be more capacity going into South America, and North America, that's where the majority of the $12 billion exit rate of installed capacity will come from. And then in 2023, you'll see -- in 2024, you'll see a pretty significant step up in EMEA.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just on EMEA, you obviously have a large Russian business. Do you anticipate the moving the Ruble and intensions there to have any financial or maybe operational impact in the quarter? And can you help us understand how you might be sort of insulated from geopolitical risk? Or how you're thinking about that?
Scott Morrison: Yes, what truly runs is a dollar-based business as most of the Russian economy does tied to oil. So and our treasury team does have an incredibly effective job of insulating us from valuation changes in the currency, so you don't see much of that, to be honest.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And I want to echo my congrats to both John and Dan. First on beverage packaging and in the America, just as we're bridging to 2022 and earnings potential for that business can you maybe just help us with what one-time occurrences that hit the expense line that should roll off as we get into this year? And just what type of operating leverage we should expect from volume growth as well?
Dan Fisher: I'll make a comment and then I'll give it over to Scott for additional detail. I say when we talk about -- when we talk about time and time again, here in the prepared remarks, sort of the net inflation drag the majority of that was North America related. And it's how we pass-through inflation in our PPI mechanism. So when you're thinking about a year-over-year bridge, you should see the benefits of that inflation transition show up throughout the year, because not every contract renewal happens on January 1. There were, as you can imagine, countless supply chain challenges, et cetera. I'm cautiously optimistic that the supply chain and the ecosystem is going to stabilize somewhat, I can't guarantee that. But I do believe you'll see improved performance because we have exited North America in a much healthier inventory position in 2021, heading into 2022 than we had in 2020. That should improve the net inflation pass-through. And I'm very encouraged with the execution as we just commented on in terms of the project, those will all be there for us to lean into. I expect North America to have a really nice year next year.
Scott Morrison: Got it, I mean the only thing I would add is exactly on the PPI adjustments, some happened in the first quarter, some happened in the second quarter, and some won't happen until the third. By the third quarter, we should see all of that benefit, or all of that cost recovery coming back to us, if you will.
Mike Leithead: Great, that's super helpful. And then second, just on capital deployment. If we go back to the Investor Day, should be about a year or so ago, you talked about roughly a billion dollars of CapEx per year through 2025. And now it seems like we're going to be running at double that this year and maybe a little bit that's coming out of buybacks versus what you talked about last quarter. So can you just talk about what's driving that change? I'm just assuming the organic growth opportunity has simply gotten better. But just any color on kind of how you're looking at that and the tradeoffs there?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think it's really the organic growth continues to strengthen. We're entering into additional contracts, long-term contracts with customers. And so we have a high degree of confidence in deploying this capital. It really hasn't changed a heck of a lot from our view in our Investor Day in 2020. If anything, it's just gotten firmed up more and become more real. And so we're executing on those plans.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Sorry about that. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the retirement, John, and congrats to you, Dan as well.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess just wanted to understand, we did hear some rumblings of some demand pullback, or even some -- maybe some COVID impacts in Q4. But it doesn't seem like there was any real impact on your business. I guess was there any COVID impact? And I guess, going forward, I guess, would you expect any impact from absenteeism or anything else like that, that would linger and potentially put some of your projects at risk?
Dan Fisher: Yes, thank you for that question. I would say COVID didn't impact our demand with the exception of precautions in South America, where it's peak season down there. And they didn't allow for the public gatherings to the same extent. That's the one where it's most acute. And we can describe that and understand that. We're absolutely experiencing some impacts to production here in the first couple of weeks of January. I mean, it's the wave of Omicron is hit. I think we had nearly double-digit dislocation of our manufacturing folks in all three regions here. Last week, it's where it peaked. I think it's sharply rose, and now it's sharply declining. So I think, we got a chance to deliver a strong first quarter. But yes, on the demand side, COVID, with the exception of South America, I'm not entirely sure we saw much impact. And I think the other question that you had was just relative to demand profile in general. For us, we've been very fortunate that the partners that we have are winning in the marketplace. And so I think in that regard, and we've, obviously, there's a ton of focus and has been for the last six months, the spiked seltzer category, we had minimal exposure to that, coupled with the fact that a number of our key partners are doing extraordinarily well in the marketplace. So that may be an insulation from maybe other participants in the market. But I'll leave it there for now.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks for that. And then, just as a follow-up, I guess, you obviously had talked about the 25 billion and 45 billion of units that you plan to bring on. That was about a year ago. There has been some other announcements by yourselves and other competitors subsequent to that. Do you still think those are kinds of the range that we'll expect to see? Or you see that maybe there's some upside to that or given the demand continues to be robust that some of these markets are on fire. I've seen some real strong numbers in the RTD ready to drink cocktail market as well. So maybe you can just update us on your capacity plans and maybe for the industry as well? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yes, first is our Investor Day 2020 late 2020, when we sort of laid out a multi-year growth plan. So as we sit here today and was referenced in a previous question, we've spent capital in excess of what we had planned at that time, up to this period, which is all good. We have really solid contracts to back it, EVA generative opportunities. So based on what we've seen thus far, we're going to take advantage if those opportunities continue to show up and manifest in the same way we'll lean into them. We've got a healthy balance sheet, as Scott's already indicated, and if there's more opportunity to grow, we'll take advantage of it. I think one thing that is a sign towards more growth is if you reference and maybe Ann could send this out as part of our materials. But Ellen MacArthur Foundation produced the top 10 CPG companies and their producer responsibility, recycled content targets over the next five years. Every one of them has a significant improved target position that they've said publicly, and they can't get there without aluminum is the bottom line. So we didn't see that type of target in earnestness behind public targets from our largest customers. They're out in the public domain now and they're going to have to hit those. So there's quite a lot of belief, at least as we sit here in Broomfield, Colorado today that we've got more upside than we do downside in those projections.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Angel Castillo: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congratulations to you both gentlemen. Just wanted to follow-up on the volume number that you noted for the fourth quarter of 7%. Given what you kind of outlined for the various reasons it seems like there might have been, maybe more in the kind of non-reportable segment that was strong growth. And I assume that's essentially imports to, whether it's North America or other region. So I was just wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on, kind of what the numbers were for the non-reportable. And then, for imports, as you see those into 2022 how should we think about those in terms of absolute numbers versus the strong 2021 that we saw?
Dan Fisher: Yes, thanks for the question. You're exactly right. The other non-reportable was up double-digits. And it's from our -- a combination of our joint ventures around the world majority owned assets. So think Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia cans were going into markets that were oversold from all of those areas. So that contributed to the uplift. I haven't [ph] made the comment on imports. I can tell you from our position we are oversold in all three markets heading into the year. And we will have to continue to shift in unnatural patterns from those locations into Europe and North America in particular in 2022. I can't comment on the competitors. But we'll continue to see import cans for sure from us to the extent that our competitors need them. I don't know that information.
Angel Castillo: Got it. And in terms of finished goods, you noted that inventory as you continue to work towards normalizing that. I think in the past, you've given kind of a sense for in terms of days where we are today versus historical. Could you just kind of update us on that how much more work there is left to do to get to a place where you really feel kind of back to normal and have good inventory heading into kind of the summer season?
Dan Fisher: I think in Europe, we're very close to where we need to be. And in North America, I don't have the specific number. I think it was in the range of will be 10 days better than we were a year-ago. In terms of finished good and that that can be a -- two weeks is, is a much better buffer than how we ended the -- began the year last year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Salvator Tiano with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Salvator Tiano: Yes, thank you very much. And John congratulations on the great carrier and Dan congratulations on the new role.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Salvator Tiano: Firstly I want to ask a little bit about hard seltzer market. And since recently, there have been some introductions in some more mainstream products with glass packaging. And there seems to be some saturation with all these brands and having all these different products of this substance. Really small subcategories of what was the hard seltzer market? Do you see any reef there that some of your customers in order to differentiate themselves may start people think it will be towards other packaging substrates?
Dan Fisher: No. I think the can because of the recycled content attributes and because of the commitments from all the major CPG companies. They just can't get to these commitments by transitioning into these other substrates. It's -- it'll be dilutive. I think the can is winning, it will continue to win every metric we have suggest. We're doing more with our major customers and they're telling us they're going to lean into the can more and more. So that -- from that standpoint, I think we're in a good spot. And then I just refer you to previous commentary on the spiked seltzer market. Our exposures very limited to that. And yes, I'll leave it at that.
Salvator Tiano: Okay, great. And, I know you've discussed topics before unless I need support, but I'm just wondering, what do you think about the high -- the elevates CapEx number this year and especially next year's guidance? If you were to look a few months or a year back, how have things changed just because of inflation on that $2 billion figure?
Dan Fisher: Inflation is a part of it, but a very small part. The real driver is opportunities that we have to deploy capital. It's too bad during COVID. We're not doing plant tours and things, but if you went to Glendale, Arizona, that would be a great example of investments that we're making that are really just spectacular facilities. So it's really driven more by opportunities and increasing our capacity versus inflation. I mean, there's definitely some inflation in steel and putting up buildings and things like that. But that's not what's driving the increase.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Congrats, Dan in a new role, and John, thanks for all the help over the years.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Phil Ng: My first question, Dan, you've been pretty explicit saying that 2022 North America is going to be sold out again. But when we think about supply demand for 2023. How are you thinking about it? I mean, are you expecting to get more balanced at that point, are still pretty much on allocation?
Dan Fisher: Yes, 2022, 2023. It's a great question. 2022 what we see in front of us were oversold. 2023 will continue to be tight based on every conversation that we're having with our customers. I just continue to think this is the case. No, I don't think this is a 2022, 2023. Things get right supply demand balances out; I think the sustainability tailwinds are so pronounced. And the commitments are now so public from our customer base that they are going to have to move into aluminum to hit those goals. And so that's what we're monitoring right now.
Phil Ng: Okay. That's really exciting. And then may be a question for Scott. For 2021, you had a net inflation drag from some of these non-metal impact. Did you call out what that headwind was in 2021? And for 2022 how should we think about startup costs relative to that $42 million you saw this year, and will have a bigger impact on margins in South America, just given the amount of capacity that's coming on in that area?
Scott Morrison: Yes, in terms of the inflation, it was over $120 million of net inflation that we had to take in 2021. The vast majority of that being in North America, the rest most of the being in Europe. As it relates to startup costs, we had $42 million in the U.S., we had $50 million overall. So we thought we'd be a little higher in the U.S. more of that a little bit of that shifted into the first quarter. So we won't see a decline necessarily. I think startup costs will still grow a little bit, because we're still looking at expanding facilities here. As it relates to South America though the startup cost really gets driven by North America where labor rates are higher. And so bringing people in six months early to train is more costly than it would be in South America. So while South America will have a tick up in startup costs, it's not gigantic.
Dan Fisher: And Phil --
Phil Ng: Got it. So, Scott. Sorry, go ahead.
Dan Fisher: A build on -- a simple build on that is if we're spending capital at a light rate, and we're standing up capacity in Greenfield's at a light rate, you'll start to see us comment less on startup costs, because it's a recurring expense. And so, the reason we spoke on it from 2020 to 2021 is a significant step-up in some very large Greenfield facilities. And it was material so that's why we commented on it. So I think we'll probably dissipate from those comments moving forward if we continue to spend, which for the foreseeable future we are.
Phil Ng: Got it. That's awful. And then, Scott the $120 million of debt inflation that is $120 million that you're behind, right? I mean, that you need to hopefully recoup this year. Is that the right way to think about it?
Scott Morrison: Yes, most of that we had to took down in 2021. And then we mentioned about our PPI escalators that we have most of our contracts we'll recover that, but we'll recover some in the first quarter, some in the second quarter. And by the third quarter we should have most of that recovered.
Phil Ng: Got it. And then -- 
Scott Morrison: Every contract is different and so it's not necessarily dollar-to-dollar, but it's pretty close.
Phil Ng: Okay. And then we've seen magnesium prices take up a little bit. Is that something you guys feel good about passing through it pretty timely. And then at least please getting supply as well particularly in Europe?
Scott Morrison: Yes, the metal capacity. So it's just a component of the metal. And things are volatile, I would say the supply chain is very tight and the metal supply chain is very tight. So I'm more concerned about that than I am about any particular component of the metal price.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John, congrats on tremendous career and Dan, congrats on the new role.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Kyle White: I wanted to ask about inventory levels, but more at the customer level. I guess you have a sense in terms of where your customers are at from their inventory standpoint, specifically in North America. And how much rebalancing do you think needs to take place anywhere to potentially quantify in terms of how many billion units you think they're short on inventories?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I don't have that detail in front of me. I think the team is marshaling through a really thoughtful inventory build plan in North America, specifically, we're in a much healthier position year-over-year. I mean, keep in mind, we understand our A level inventory is probably 80% of our sales volume. We've got annual forecasts that we're operating off of, a lot of the labels that you'd see right now would be super Ball related, et cetera. So anything that would be a change in graphics, I think we've got good line of sight into, and I think the team is going to execute really well here in the first quarter.
Kyle White: Got it. And then I wanted to touch on CSDs, particularly in North America. I mean, historically, this category was driving declines for the industry, but it's now experiencing some growth, which is quite meaningful, given how large the category is. I'm just curious, what you're hearing from your key customers on this in terms of what is driving that growth? And are they bullish on it such that they are actually investing in incremental filling capacity for it?
Dan Fisher: They're absolutely investing and filling capacity for it. Demand aluminum, it's a combination of a slight substrate shift or leaning and all the new products that are being launched in North America are being launched in cans. And it will be interesting to see habits have clearly changed over the last two years, there's more at-home consumption, and that at-home consumption, overwhelmingly benefits aluminum packaging. And so I think the combination of all those three, we're talking to them. We're planning longer-term, in terms of maturity and supply. And I'm kind of bullish on that segment for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mike Roxland: Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Congrats, Dan, on your additional role.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Mike Roxland: And congrats John on all your accomplishments. And in particular, your retirement from all these earnings calls. Just first part of this is probably on what Phil mentioned and Daniel response to the oversold in 2022. Dan you mentioned 2023 will be tight. But you need the word oversold. So I'm wondering how much of your capacity production is accounted for in 2023 at this point?
Dan Fisher: I would say 95% is accounted for. There's probably an element of spot volume. But keep in mind; we've got contracts that roll over at various times. And so it's not a 100% contracted, but it's overwhelmingly contracted. And I wouldn't parse out the -- my comment about not saying we're oversold. I'll give you more detail when we get more into 2022 as it relates to 2023. And we have conversation with our customers right now. Everyone is laser focused on trying to navigate they're here and now getting cans on the shelves. And so we're talking about 2022. But I think our capacity that we're putting in place, as we've said now for several years, it's contracted. It's EVA generative, and it's going to -- we're going to like the returns.
Scott Morrison: And remember, it's January of 2022. So we've been surprised by the upside since our Investor Day. And we're not making great predictions about 2023. But to Dan's comments, everything we're seeing looks pretty dark good.
Mike Roxland: A bunch of great color. And just one question following-up on inventories and current supply chain logistics issues. How should we think about -- how do you think about inventory levels coming out the other side of COVID. So obviously, you had a certain level of level of inventories pre COVID. Should we expect that inventories or you'll be managing to a higher level of inventory going forward? To me -- my sense is that this just in time needs to be modified given what everybody has been experiencing in the last call it 12 to 18 months. I'm not sure what your thoughts are, but just want to get your thoughts around inventory management on a go-forward basis.
Dan Fisher: Yes, I've been in manufacturing for 30 years, and for 29 of those, we've been moving jobs overseas. And we've been low cost country sourcing, and we've gone to a just in time mentality. And I think all of that will change moving forward. I don't know what that means in terms of working capital, use of cash, I would imagine there would be a combination of folks are going to get a hell of a lot smarter and more effective and efficient on the stocking levels, they have to manage that working capital. But you would think you're going to have to buttress the working capital with trucking continues to be a concern, a number of things that you're managing, but I think this just in time inventory phase may be a thing of the past for the next few years.
Mike Roxland: Got you. Good luck in 2022.
Dan Fisher: Terrific. Thank you. Malika, we are a couple minutes over. So maybe we take one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Next question is from the line off of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
George Staphos: Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here.
Dan Fisher: George, we've got you.
John Hayes: We got you.
George Staphos: Oh, my gosh. Well, congratulations to both of you in the next chapters and John, in particular, it has been great working with you the last 22 years and congratulations on all the performance. I guess I have two questions. I guess, first of all, thinking about Europe and what's been going on there from a geopolitical standpoint, are your customers? Are you doing anything differently to manage against the risk? I don't know that you could. But if there is anything that you could share on how you're guarding against that would be appreciated. Second question, bigger picture, Dan, how do you see the company's evolution on a couple of fronts over your tenure relative to John's tenure vis-à-vis what you're going to do to promote sustainability in aluminum place and how the footprint of Ball's facilities evolve over time you have all these opportunities coming in, you're spending more capital and you should be given the EVA returns that you're seeing, what's it going to mean in terms of your typical plant in terms of its flexibility, size, modularity, and so on. Thanks, guys and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Yes. So a lot there. I will tell you, the thing that I'm most proud of to inherit in this role is that and John has steward us to this point, we are a sustainability company. All of our strategies in all of our businesses are tied to circularity. And even in aerospace, we have a wonderful opportunity to lean into our climate censoring technology, our data analytics. And so I think that does a couple of things for us. If you don't have sustainability tailwind, you've got a headwind and our businesses have tailwind. The other thing is, it's an incredibly powerful attractor of talent, not just our incredible culture here at Ball. But folks want to make a change; they want to make a difference. And they can do that at Ball. And so I'm going to lean heavily into that. And I think the leadership team that's supporting me and supporting our 24,000 employees, all believe in that. And so what that means, we have to tell our circularity story, we have to own the aluminum story, we have to improve every aspect of that story. The primary goal of that is recycled content. And I think our supply chain partners know that, we know that. And we're going to try to influence the hell out of that over the next decade. One of the things that John commented on in his prepared comments are, I asked John specifically to stay in role and support this business because he has been a foundational element and storyteller of our product. And John is going to continue to do that at the highest levels of our government, and stakeholders around the world. And we're going to lean on that and continue to build off that. I'd say that that our 24,000 folks are going to are going to define our future a hell of a lot more than Dan Fisher is. But what we have this culture, how we focus on our capital investments, and the company being a sustainability company, first and foremost is something that we've got a hell of an opportunity to build on, George.
George Staphos: Understood. And on Europe and footprint and I will leave it there.
Dan Fisher: Yes, the risk profile maybe I'll talk, we do a phenomenal job. We have a significant presence in Russia. We -- as Scott has indicated, it's a dollar based business that's where the most speculation and geopolitical stability -- instability is right now maybe I can have Scott talk about how we look at hedging, how we protect ourselves in contracts and energy contracts, et cetera.
George Staphos: It's more about what your customers might be doing or not doing and maybe it's something we'll take offline, but it wasn't so much to hedging, but what are you doing to prevent against risk and your customers as well?
Dan Fisher: Yes, they're still investing. They're investing in filling lines at an accelerated rate versus what we've seen historically, they're still bullish. We're still bullish on aluminum cans. And that's why we're continuing to lean in with candidly three new Greenfields in Europe that is a significant -- that's a significant statement by us and our customers that have been contracted for those facilities to continue to grow in those areas.
George Staphos: Okay, Dan, why don't we table it from here. Thanks very much for the time and good luck in the quarter. Thanks guys.
Dan Fisher: Thank you, George.
Dan Fisher: And Malika, with that I will just thank everyone for their questions and look forward to speaking to everybody at the end of the first quarter and everybody stay safe.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 4, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you Dina. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s third quarter 2021 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don’t already have our earnings release, it’s available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today’s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’ll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then I’ll finish up with comments on our outlook for the company. Ball Corporation finished the quarter on a strong position despite challenging year-over-year comparable results from the economic recovery this time last year, continued supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures that are being experienced in the rest of the manufacturing world. For the quarter, we generated comparable operating earnings of $417 million, which is flat against prior year and up 13% from 2019 while generating comparable diluted earnings per share of $0.94, up 6% versus the prior year and 34% over 2019. Underlying demand for our products remains strong. Shipped volumes in the quarter were up 1% North and Central America where we dealt with freight and supply disruptions, while simultaneously deliberately building back our inventories. In EMEA, volumes were up 4% driven by continued package mix shifts. And in South America, volumes were down mid-teens percent largely due to a difficult year-over-year comparable as South America ramped up significantly in the third quarter of 2020 after being largely shut down during the second quarter of 2020. As we look forward, we expect year-over-year growth to accelerate further with strong expectations in the fourth quarter and going forward. Dan will elaborate more in his comments and we'll also focus on providing more detail by segment. During the third quarter, we began absorbing the impact of global supply chain hardship clauses being triggered by some of our suppliers for the first time in decades, while also weathering the impact of indirect supply chain disruptions for certain materials, dunnage, freight and transportation at our customer locations. Though we have existing mechanisms in our contracts to recoup certain costs and are confident in our ability to recoup such costs over time, at the moment these mechanisms are not sufficient in the current environment. And as a result we are implementing a comprehensive commercial cost recovery plan to cover unprecedented excessive costs outside of our normal customer engagements. Our commercial teams have begun discussions with our customers on a case-by-case basis the need for such cost recovery efforts if we are to continue to invest alongside the growth of our customers and partners. In conjunction with our commercial cost recovery plan, we'll also leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses. Despite this our five-year growth and profitability outlook that we discussed a year ago at our Investor Day remains intact and we are very excited about our trajectory going into 2020. Demand for our products and technologies continues to outstrip supply and our new facility start-ups are all on track or better relative to our plans, which will both lead to significant growth in long-term diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to our shareholders over the foreseeable future. Other third quarter 2021 highlights include our global beverage can business completing the start-up of six lines including four in North America, one in EMEA and one in South America and announcing two additional greenfields in Nevada and North Carolina; our global aerosol -- aluminum aerosol volumes, up 15%; our cups team signing new contracts with the world's largest retailer in a major food service distribution and hospitality partner; our aerospace team opening its state-of-the-art payload development facility in Broomfield Colorado, expanding our aerospace manufacturing center in Westminster Colorado as well as successfully launching the Ball-built OLI land imaging instrument on NASA's Landsat 9 satellite. Our North America and South America aluminum packaging business is continuing progress on the respective aluminum stewardship initiative certifications following EMEA's ASI certification last year. Our business has hired over 2,000 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth. We successfully raised $850 million in a 10-year bond offering at three and eighth percent; our Board declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.20 and electing Dr. Dune Ives to our Board who will bring a wealth of experience and knowledge as we proactively position our products to be the most sustainable in their respective categories; and in 2021 continuing to be on track to return $1 billion to shareholders, while deploying in excess of $1.5 billion in EVA-accretive growth capital investments, while generating earnings per share growth over time of at least 10% to 15%. In summary, despite near-term headwinds, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level and ready to take our performance to the next level. To all of our global employees, customers and suppliers, thank you for your hard work for staying safe and for navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. Collectively, we are working to regain efficiencies recover costs and deliver long-term value to stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to our President Dan Fisher. Dan?
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We strive to keep our teams safe. And to everyone listening, we strongly encourage vaccination and boosters. As John mentioned, the global operations, commercial and procurement teams are managing accelerated growth large-scale capacity additions, while navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. These impacts are largely outside of Ball's control and includes steep supplier cost pass-throughs beyond normal levels. Ultimately, the compounding effect of labor and trucking shortages outside of Ball had impacted our operational efficiencies, customers' production and filling operations as well as retailers' efficiency stocking store shelves, the degree of which varies greatly by region. Given the scale of cost being passed on to us and as John mentioned earlier, we are beginning conversations towards implementing the additional commercial cost recovery program. Our aerospace and aluminum packaging businesses delivered a tremendous amount of value amid current conditions. Third quarter single-digit volume growth in North America and EMEA aluminum beverage packaging was offset by double-digit volume declines in South America due to tough year-over-year comps of 30% growth in third quarter 2020 largely due to the timing effects of COVID in South America versus third quarter 2019 demand. Our retail marketing investments in cups continues and supports additional food service launches at stadiums and venues continues across the US. The Ball aluminum cup will begin an initial rollout at a major retailer during the fourth quarter and a new contract with a leading global food service and hospitality company that will further broaden the cups' presence at stadiums and venues. Our aerospace team brought online new infrastructure investments on time and on budget and supported the successful launch of OLI aboard the Landsat 9 spacecraft complementing our legacy of value-added Earth imaging science. Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. We remain on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity. We also recently announced additional domestic projects, all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary. To all the teams listening, I know it's been challenging to keep up with the growth, keep your heads held high and focus on basic blocking and tackling. We have the contracts, we have the raw materials, we have the equipment and we have each other. We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability and driving our D&I goals. Our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI certification by year-end 2021. We launched Brazil's first Circular Economy Lab in October and we continue to finalize our steps to achieve to become carbon neutral prior to 2050 after publicly stating our intent to achieve such goal. As we discussed throughout 2021 growth isn't always linear. Given our year-to-date global beverage shipment growth of 7% and recent supply chain dynamics we are on course to achieve high single-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% for full year 2021. We continue to see annual growth rates in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. Ball is well positioned to capture growth, given our timely execution on new capacity additions and our established scale and innovation in the world's largest can regions. Now a few brief comments on each region. In North America beverage third quarter ship volumes were up 1% versus 2020 and up 7.4% versus 2019. During the quarter earnings were down as volume growth was offset by the combined effect of inflationary cost increases from suppliers above current cost recovery provisions project start-up costs and operational inefficiencies in legacy plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory and indirect supply chain disruptions. Glendale and Pittston successfully started up additional lines during the quarter. Both plants will exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed and our Bowling Green manufacturing plant started up successfully in early October. In the near term the work to build adequate inventory levels is ongoing. These actions and cost recovery will further position the business for success in 2022. Following the successful on-time start-ups of Glendale, Pittston and Bowling Green Ball has announced two new greenfield plants in Nevada and North Carolina. Both are supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate these facilities coming online in late 2022 and '24 respectively. Lastly, I would be remiss not to acknowledge and thank Colin Gillis who is retiring from Ball for his 48 years of dedication to the company and our industry. We wish him well. Kathleen Pitre who many of you know was our Chief Commercial and Sustainability Officer in our global beverage business will do a great job in leading this business in the future. In EMEA segment ship volume for the third quarter was up 4% versus 2020 on tougher comps given prior year's volume increases due to COVID reopening timing and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus third quarter 2019 volumes were up 10.7%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. Year-to-date our can volumes in EMEA are up 9%.  Ongoing high single-digit growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and our new greenfield plants in the UK, Russia and Czech Republic which are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key partners. Our EMEA team is executing very well and managing complex country-by-country supply chain issues. In South America third quarter volumes were down upper teens percent versus 2020 and up high single digits percent versus 2019. 2020 volumes were up 30% versus third quarter 2019 due to timing effects related to COVID. Cooler-than-normal seasonal temperatures in the first two months of the third quarter this year and weather damage sustained to our Extrema facility contributed to lower year-over-year volumes. With unseasonably cold temperatures and the facility disruption largely behind us, October volumes recovered and were up 5%. We continue to see more earnings upside in South America in 2022 and beyond. The Frutal Brazil plant started up its first line earlier this month and anticipate starting up, its second line in early 2022. Additional investments throughout the region are also on schedule. As we enter the busy summer selling season and given the nice volume bounce back in October, we anticipate double-digit can growth for the full year and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online. In summary our global beverage team is preparing for long-term durable growth, while managing volatility and costs across our supply chain. No doubt money was left on the table. We are laser focused on operating safely, controlling the things we can control, recovering cost and delivering high-quality cans to our customers from new and existing facilities supported by equitable contracts. Our aluminum aerosol team did a good job supplying growth across EMEA, Mexico, and Brazil, resulting in 15% higher volumes in the third quarter globally versus 2020 and 5% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period. The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. In addition, the business continues to expand the rollout of refillable reclosable aluminum personal care and bottle packaging across multiple categories. To support the new cups contracts, I mentioned earlier, we have increased marketing investments and are adding another cup manufacturing line in our Rome Georgia cups plant. Following this investment, both lines will be capable of making multiple cup sizes. Turning to profitability. We anticipate 2021 total investment cost in the cup business will be in the range of $45 million and we expect the business turning a profit in 2022. Turning to Aerospace. The team continued to win contracts and maintain record backlog. The operating earnings were up in the quarter and included the impact of rate adjustments on fixed-price contracts. This business continues to be positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2021 and margin improvement beyond 2021 given contract mix. Across all of our operations, we are actively investing in the businesses to deliver on strong demand and grow and train our labor base while also effectively managing supply chain disruptions, recovering costs, achieving returns on capital employed, nurturing our culture, and delivering shareholder value. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done across the organization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. As John mentioned, third quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.94 versus $0.89 in 2020, an increase of 6%. Comparable year-to-date 2021 diluted earnings per share up 17%. Third quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher sales volumes and improved mix. Comparable third quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in EMEA, South America aerospace and aluminum aerosol, and a lower effective tax rate related to higher R&D tax credits offset by lower North American beverage operating earnings, previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate, labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy and with ample liquidity and flexibility. During the quarter, we completed a successful $850 million bond offering at three 1/8%. Proceeds will support general corporate purposes. And in late October, we used the proceeds to redeem the bonds that were due in March of 2022. In addition, we completed the purchase of group annuity contracts and lump sum payments for certain US pension benefit obligations. Assets totaling $325 million were transferred to an insurance company during the quarter. The purchases triggered non-cash settlement losses of $130 million recorded in business consolidation and other activities. Year-to-date, Ball has contributed approximately $200 million to its remaining pension plans. As we sit here today, some key additional metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 15%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $80 million to reflect lower benefit accruals. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new project -- new growth capital projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners and through the lens of EVA discipline, we will prudently balance growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As John mentioned earlier, we'll return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021 and we intend to double that total return in 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to you John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In summary, our Drive for 10 vision continues to serve as our guide. We know who we are, we know where we're going and we know what's important. Following our strong year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are positioned to exceed our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15% and achieve our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond. While we and the rest of the manufacturing world face inflation and supply chain headwinds in the near-term that are reminiscent of the 1970s, we are confident that we will get through it. You've heard from us that the sustainable growth trajectory of our business continues. And as we sit here today, we continue to believe we are on the front end of a decadal shift that will favor our packages. The key to our success is to just be Ball, be close to our customers, focus on attention to detail, and act like true owners of the business. If we do this, we will generate significant earnings cash, EVA, and return even more value to our shareholders, all while helping to make our world more sustainable. In preparation for 2022, we intend to host our biennial Investor Day activities on September 21st and 22nd in Colorado and thank you for investing in Ball. And with that, Dina ,we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Hope you can hear me okay.
John Hayes: Yes, we can.
George Staphos: Thanks for all the details. I know you have a lot of people on the line, so I'll just keep my questions to two. So, first of all, John, can you talk a little bit and Dan about the implementation of your commercial cost recovery plan and relatedly the hardship clauses that you mentioned? And in the third quarter, can you quantify to some degree what the unrecovered cost and other supply chain factors were. Your press release said a lot of this is going to continue into the fourth quarter so it would be helpful to know what it was in 3Q. And then I had one other question.
John Hayes: Yes. Happy to answer that George. And as I said in my prepared remarks this inflation we've seen we really haven't seen this from the 1970s. And as you know because you've been around a long time, we have various cost pass-through provisions in our contracts. In this such steep inflationary, they're lagging behind. And so I'll let -- I'll turn it over to Scott in a minute and he can talk about numbers. But -- and every customer is different. I would try and probably bucket it in three different ways. We have -- number one, we have some longer-term contracts where we have PPI and other provisions, but it's a lag. And so, we're in discussions with our partners about investing in the future as part of that because we need to be recovering those if we're going to be able to invest going forward. The others, we have some contracts coming up and we've already baked that in and priced that into those discussions that we've been having. And then we have some open contracts that we will be pricing it in. Every customer is a bit different, but this is -- we need to make sure that we are adequately capturing during all the costs in a timely way because we do believe over time we would get it. And if the hardship clauses and other things begin to abate, we're happy to talk to other customers about making sure that they participate in that as well. So, maybe what I'll do is quickly turn it over to Scott, he can talk about the specific numbers.
Scott Morrison: Yes. George and inflation impacts in the third quarter in North America alone think in the range of $25 million to $30 million. And there's probably another $10 million of inefficiencies where customers are out of CO2, so they can't run their operations. They don't have labor to run their operations, dunnage shortages things like that that impacted us negatively to the tune of roughly 10 -- probably $10 million-plus in the quarter.
George Staphos: Okay. Thanks Scott. And just I'm not quite sure I recall what goes into the hardship clause if you could touch on that. And then one of your -- to your other comment John about decadal shift in beverage cans and your packaging. Clearly, we've seen really good growth over the last number of years. One of your larger customers yesterday was having an ESG Day of sorts. And it seems from our vantage point a lot of the focus was on trying to make plastics more sustainable. What were your impressions about the plastics industry attempt to do this? And what are you seeing from your customers in terms of whether they truly see that as a solution or whether aluminum is still the preferred solution recognizing you might be a little bit biased in that? Thanks. I'll turn it over and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: So, maybe I'll take the hardship clause. George, thanks for the question. I think about sort of compounds, inks, chemicals, epoxies that world. Traditionally, the pass-through mechanisms largely as John indicated, at least, for the last 20, 30 years sort of mirror our commercial contracts. But when those chemicals get outside of kind of a compounding inflationary rate, it differs for each compound, let's say, in excess of 10% just for purposes of this discussion. They have the ability to pass those through in shorter time intervals than on an annual basis. So we've been absorbing that. And that's largely what we're experiencing. From a plastic standpoint maybe, I'll let John, handle that and then maybe I can give some color on the specific conversations we're having with customers on the branding side.
John Hayes: George, it's -- this whole larger topic it's -- the consumer realizes that plastic is polluting our planet. Full stop. We recognize that many of our customers have deep profit pools that are filled with plastic and we don't anticipate that they're going to do a wholesale shift from aluminum -- from plastic to aluminum. But let me just -- I'll pick on Europe right now. In 2019, the total package share of cans was 27%. 2021 it's 31%. That's a four percentage point change. CSD went from 16% can penetration to 19% in 2021. Beer went from 35% to 37%. Energy went from 69% to 76%. That's just in Europe. The same thing is going on here in North America. And so if you really want to talk about the circularity and the circular economy plastic is not the solution to that. We recognize that there are certain instances where plastic may make more sense. But in a wholesale way the train is already leaving and that's why we said that we really do believe this is a decadal shift and you're going to see more and more going into this. You see in the existing infrastructure bill there is discussion about infrastructure investments in the recycling side. You talk about plastic taxes that are on current bills on the floor right now. This is not leaving, this whole extended producer responsibility is going to become more and more important. Even in this quarter alone, Maine introduced an extended producer responsibility for responsibility law for plastic because they recognize that it's polluting the planet. This is only going to accelerate and we have a solution.
Dan Fisher: The only thing I'd add to the comments I think you asked the question in and around customers and discussion. I would think about it this way, George, there are whole brands that are in PET. In the conversations we're having, very candid conversations with our customers, that's a real problem. And right now we can't move fast enough to convert those entire brands over. And as a result I think folks are fighting a good fight to hold on to PET and collection efforts and what they can for as long as they can because the anti-plastic sentiment is not going anywhere. It's accelerating and the conversations we're having are candidly far different than even were a year ago.
George Staphos: Thank you, Dan. Thank you, John.
John Hayes: Thank you 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess on the 1% volume growth in North and Central America knowing that you had tough comps, I'm just trying to understand, how much of the moderation in growth is supply chain related versus the actual comp. And just given all the constraints at current has that started to slow new beverage launches at the customer level? Just trying to understand how volumes will evolve over the next couple of quarters, as your capacity gets layered in and where exactly the bottlenecks are in the supply chain and how you're managing your suppliers in context of that.
Dan Fisher: It's a great question. I think Scott commented, in his financial overview on some of the impacts. But I think when you think of dunnage, when you think of freight and when you think of candidly labor issues both with our suppliers and our customers breweries are struggling filling locations are struggling. So it's across the entirety of the ecosystem. Rough math when we've investigated sort of what our growth would be in a more stable supply chain for North America it would have been in excess of 6% growth shipped volumes for the quarter.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then in terms of Europe just your outlook for 2022. One of your peers talked about a tougher year in Europe for them next year and I'm just curious as to how you're viewing it at this point.
Dan Fisher: Yes. We're not looking at it in similar terms. So we're very bullish on Europe. Some of this has to do -- and we've reflected on this historically, we've got a significant presence in the U.K. in Russia and with a large energy drink customer. And everything that we're seeing is really strong growth projected for 2022 and beyond. In a larger aggregate, we're in the early stages kind of putting together our three-year strat plan right now. Ghansham, when I look at the three major regions, maybe this will be helpful, we're looking at demand in excess of capacity to the degree in the neighborhood of 10 billion units, again, for next year and Europe has a good portion of that. So we're very bullish on the investments we've got going in the ground and the continued dialogue with our customers.
John Hayes: Yes. And even to my comments, Ghansham, on the commercial cost recovery plans, we're doing that in Europe. And so we expect to see good profitability growth in 2022. It's -- now I will caution that it's early November 2021 right now. So we still have a lot of work to do and some go get, but that's our expectation.
Ghansham Panjabi: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. I guess, first off on -- maybe I can just get your perspective on the issues around magnesium. How would you kind of characterize maybe your supply? And maybe if there's any outlook on cost inflation in the magnesium area by region over the next, say, six months or so?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think, the magnesium issue, you could argue that's a little overblown. I think in talking with our supply base on a regular basis -- typically you would hold anywhere between six to nine months of inventory. I think we've got assets, human capital actually that's in China that's working on a daily basis with our supply base over there and magnesium suppliers there. The operations are back up and running. I think there was an inflection point in inflation, as you said, a few weeks back. I think that's dissipating pretty significantly right now. So as we sit here today, I appreciate the question, but this is not sort of top of mind in terms of the surety supply issues, either with our supply base or with our -- or from a cost perspective.
Arun Viswanathan: And then, just a little bit more detail on the larger cost reduction program. How did this kind of come about? And I guess, is this kind of a structural change to your business, or is that kind of the objective longer term? And if so, what kind of productivity targets should we think about on an annual basis? Thanks.
John Hayes: No, this -- I mean, I think, my prepared comments speak for themselves. I think this was a big accelerant during the third quarter and it is faster. And we've had to choke down some of those things. And so we're just working with our customers as partners saying we got to share in this going forward. But I don't believe it's structural. And as I said, to the extent they come back down, we'll work with our customers to make sure that they benefit from that as well. It's just we should not be the toggle in the whole supply chain switch here. That's the main point.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kyle White: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on volumes in South America. I think you said October was up 5% and you're pointing to double-digit growth for the full year, which I think would imply a much larger growth than 5% in 4Q, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something there. So any details you can provide on South America and trends there.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think that's largely correct. I mean, we don't -- we're not going to go into forward guidance, but I think the reverse engineer of the math would suggest -- I'll tell you this, we're selling every single can we're making in South America. And so, if you backtrack into the capacity that we've added, reverse engineer that, you get to, I think, very close to the hypothesis you put forward.
Kyle White: Got it. That helps. And then, just talking about price elasticity of demand in regards to the beverage can, maybe just overall thoughts on that? And more specifically, for example, on premixed cocktails, which I think is kind of a faster-growing category that a lot of can-makers are bullish on. But some of those products are already priced relatively high for consumers. Are you concerned at all in terms of growth being impacted from all the inflation that we're seeing?
Dan Fisher: I'm not. And why I'm not or why we're not is when we look to a number of our customers. And if you look to some of their commentary, they're saying if you have innovation and you have the product the can candidly, they're not seeing the same historical constraints relative to price elasticity. I think as John indicated, it's still November 2021. So I don't know where all of this goes in terms of supply-demand impacts. But the other thing that we're looking at is, inflation is hitting and supply chain challenges are hitting every other substrate. And I don't think anyone is going to retrench further into plastic or other substrates at this point given the sustainability challenges that those substrates have. So as we sit here today pretty positive, pretty bullish that these products can take on more price. And it won't impact the volume curve.
Scott Morrison: And the only thing -- other thing, I'd add as well is when you think about all the substrates in beverage packaging whether it's plastic glass, aluminum cans the raw underlying costs are all tied in one way shape or form to energy. And so they all over time have a correlation that's relatively consistent. And I think it's -- I think sometimes we all collectively forget that about a little bit.
Kyle White: Got it, I'll hand it over. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Salvator Tiano with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Salvator Tiano: Yes. Hi. So, …
Scott Morrison: Hi.
Salvator Tiano: … the first thing I want to understand a little bit is, as you think about your contracts and your pass-through mechanisms and recovery how do they differ by region EMEA, South American and North Central America? And how should we think about the price cost performance in the next few quarters by each region?
Dan Fisher: I think the only meaningful difference I think the economic integrity of each contract and the pass-through mechanisms are consistent. They may be more tied to regional inflationary mechanisms, as opposed to a standard inflation pass-through. And the only thing that we're saying and the cost recovery comment that John provided in his prepared remarks is that, these pass-through mechanisms outside of metal typically work a year in arrears. And in an inflationary period, that we're experiencing again something that we haven't seen in 40 years that's not sufficient for quarter-to-quarter P&L integrity. And so we're going to try to address that with new contracts that we're entering and partnerships that we have established.
Salvator Tiano: And just to clarify here. You mentioned okay, one year lag essentially but the idea was that as you were negotiating contracts and getting better -- make a better terms for the past few years one of the terms was offsetting of this cost. So, were the lags worse -- longer before? What has changed versus a few years ago?
John Hayes: No. Some of them -- what's happened a couple of years ago in some of the contracts particularly in the ones that we acquired through the acquisition didn't even have inflation pass-throughs. And so we've certainly adjusted that. I think what Dan just said is completely correct. It's really just the timing effect here. But again as I said earlier, we should not be the toggle in all this. And I think it's important that that's what we're focused on with our customers.
Dan Fisher: And the only thing that's different is inflation has gone through the roof at an accelerated pace. So that's been the difference. But the contracts have worked how we thought they would work.
Salvator Tiano: Okay. Perfect. And just a little bit on 2022 recognizing, you typically don't provide specific guidance, but any key pointers you can provide for next year's earnings or EBITDA or any other buckets that can drive the earnings bridge?
John Hayes: I will stand by that we feel very bullish with all the investments we're making that we will be able to meet or exceed our 10% to 15% long-term earnings per share goals as well as our 4% to 8% EVA growth.
Salvator Tiano: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks and good morning guys.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: First I wanted to square maybe two of your comments on North American beverage can. I think you said shipments would have been up 6% or so if the downstream supply chain was just working better. And then secondly, you talked about inventories in the system still being quite low. So I guess, were you able to use some of that gap versus your actual 1% shipments to rebuild inventory in the quarter, or am I kind of misunderstanding some of the moving pieces there?
Dan Fisher: No. That's a great comment and good insight. Yes, we are really holding firm on trying to build inventory in Europe and in North America, specifically at this point in time. So some of that has constrained the ability to ship within the quarter, but the comment is in and around the 6% or – looking at Q3 for North America in particular, we thought we'd be – when we look at the upstream and downstream disruptions, within the supply chain ecosystem, we would have been north of 6% for ship volume growth in the quarter.
Mike Leithead: Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, I think the 3Q cash ending balance was the highest 3Q level in a while. And you did call it $200 million in buybacks in the quarter and you probably need to double that or so in 4Q to get to $1 billion cash return this year. So I guess, is there something wonky around the quarter end cash timing there, or I guess, why wasn't buybacks maybe a bit higher here in 3Q?
Scott Morrison: Yeah, there is something wonky. We did a bond offering during the quarter, and then we redeemed notes after the end of the quarter. So that's why the cash balance was so high. It will normalize by the end of the year. It's normalized as of today. We paid off those bonds a couple of weeks ago.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Kieran De Brun: Good morning. This is Kieran on for Chris. Just on the aerospace business, you had a strong quarter in 3Q. It looks like you're having some contracts ramping that benefited you and should continue to benefit in the fourth quarter. Any color you can give us around those contracts like where are you seeing the pockets of strength stronger activity and maybe how we should think about that ramping into next year would be helpful? Thank you.
Dan Fisher: No, it's good insight. I think you're reading it correctly. We're stepping into the meat of the backlog, if you will, and some stronger margin projects that are starting to kick off. They'll continue into 2022, 2023 and 2024. And so you should see – and I think I established that in my prepared remarks, you should see favorable project mix starting to show up in a cascading way over the next several years.
Kieran De Brun: Great. And then just a quick one, I was wondering, if you can just parse out in terms of the volume headwinds that you experienced in the quarter in South America, is there any way that you can give us an idea of the magnitude from the weather events on the overall impact versus the kind of difficult comps per se?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I think it's a combination of two things. What you saw in – from quarter two to quarter three in 2020 was a V-shaped recovery in that market. And so you shipped out a lot of inventory heading into Q3 that you built in Q2 transitioning out of COVID. Both July and August were double-digit declines in terms of year-over-year shipments, and we were more in line with the flattish growth trajectory in September. You should think probably in the neighborhood of one billion units was compromised in those – in that 8-week period.
Kieran De Brun: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Angel Castillo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just was wondering, if you could give us a similar view of what you've talked about kind of with South America and North America in terms of particularly for EMEA in terms of the ex-this environment and kind of the supply issues or supply constraints and intermittent issues that have taken place there, what growth would have been in that region for EMEA?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I don't have that readily available. Probably, a couple of percentage points more of growth would be what I would suggest. It was far more significant in North America, where the supply chain issues across the entirety of the ecosystem. And it was compounded by the fact candidly that we had such low inventory levels. We could not react in locations in filling locations. If there was an opportunity to ship more, we just didn't have the safety stock to lean into that. So, it's far more pronounced in North America. But yes, we left a little growth on the table in Europe for sure.
John Hayes: Yes. And I think when I think through it I specifically think about the driver shortages -- and even in Russia. And CO2 there are CO2 issues in the UK where many of our customers were down for several weeks if not longer on that. So, I think it was largely -- every country was a bit different. There are slight issues in Germany from a freight perspective trucker perspective. But I immediately think of the U.K. and Russia.
Dan Fisher: Yes, the most pronounced was the UK, I agree.
Angel Castillo: That's very helpful. And then in terms of you kind of touched on it earlier just impacts I guess to the customer level. As we think about -- I think you talked about it a little bit last year -- or sorry last quarter in terms of still water and what you're starting to see maybe some more chatter around that or maybe more launches. I guess any impact to that? Are you how is that progressing in terms of what you're hearing from your customers in terms of intentions or potential products there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. There is a fervor around still water right now. And what you're seeing is like I think any new market that's opening up, it's an awful lot of entrepreneurial attempts at it. And I think anything that's a closed venue, so it could be anything from the venues that we're seeing concerts, and the sporting events to theaters to airlines to you name it those are easy locations to change out plastic and the composition of that in those venues and so lots of conversations in and around that. I won't go into too much detail because it will steal our strategic thunder. But I would see more and more opportunity moving forward with larger and larger brands to get more into still water.
Angel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning and congratulations to Colin. Some of your peers have seen demand impacted by COVID lockdowns maybe in some regions that you don't participate in as much like Southeast Asia. But I'm just wondering it sounds like there's some restrictions in Russia, which is a big market for you and maybe kind of a worsening of cases in Europe. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any impact from that or if there's sort of a holistic way to think about that risk. Or do you think your customers in the channel have maybe gotten better in terms of managing those kinds of restrictions but still delivering product? Just kind of any thoughts there.
Dan Fisher: Yes, it's interesting. We have a significant series of assets and ecosystem in Russia. It feels like every other week there's something that pops up there. So, I would tell you that the customers, the suppliers, and us have started to figure it out. And of course, we're not immune to a significant event in a major city, but I think everything that we're hearing is we're able to operate. Our team is doing a remarkable job figuring how to keep our folks safe and keep our customers in cans. We are still on allocation there. That is a terrific market and has been for us and will continue to be into 2022 right now. We are not concerned about continuing business surety or business continuance in that part of the world.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then the release mentions your sale of the minority stake in South Korea. I'm just wondering if you could touch upon that decision. And then maybe going the other way I mean your balance sheet is in good shape. Are there any opportunities at the margin for bolt-ons or acquisitions understanding you have a lot of organic growth opportunities in-house.
Scott Morrison: Yes, I'll take the first part. The sale of the Korean JV that it was -- it wasn't really a strategic place for us to be. Our global customers it's not a critical place for us to operate. And for us the best solution -- and frankly, it was marginally profitable. So, frankly, the best solution was to get our capital off the table and do other things with it that we can earn better returns on. I'll turn it to John--
John Hayes: Yes. On the strategic front, it's -- while we're always looking, it's not the highest priority for us right now. And we've been looking -- we always look in all of our different businesses for opportunities, but to your point, it's well taken. We have more opportunities, internal opportunities for growth than I've seen in my 23 years at Ball Corporation. And we think that we're -- for the foreseeable future, we're going to continue to see that. Will there be an opportunity that pops up, kind of, like what happened in aluminum aerosol last year in Brazil? Yeah, there could be things like that. But I don't think it's anything that would stretch our balance sheet materially.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey guys. You've provided great insight in terms of how demand and volumes are tracking in Brazil call it October and just more broadly in the fourth quarter. Any color on how things are shaping up in North America and Europe right now, just because it would be helpful to give us a perspective as some of these issues you saw in the 3Q is abating at this point?
Dan Fisher: I think we're managing them better. I think the demand profile looks healthier in terms of improved performance year-over-year. I think we're also trying to manage and balance in my previous comments building inventory. So we can more effectively manage peak season next year, because we did not do an effective job of that this year in North America in particular. And it cost us a lot of money. So we are going to balance and try to thread that needle in terms of we're still oversold in North America. And if we're going to do the right thing for our customers, we're going to protect them for peak season next year.
Phil Ng: Got it. That's helpful. And then that's a perfect segue Dan. When you kind of look out to 2022, how should we think about start-up costs in North America because you're adding more capacity? But more importantly, how much bandwidth do you have in that market for growth just assuming everything lines up properly? And how do you see inventory levels shaping up as you head into that peak selling season next year?
Scott Morrison: Look I think start-up costs would be in the same range because we're still starting up a lot of assets next year. It could come down a little bit. But we'll have the benefit of -- we're exiting this year with 12 billion more units to sell next year. So I think that will -- we'll have a nice lift in profitability because of the investments that we're making today that will more than offset the start-up costs next year.
Dan Fisher: Yeah, you will see -- in North America specifically I think that's where you're catching that comment. You will see the majority of -- we've talked repeatedly that we will exit the year with 12 billion units globally of installed capacity heading into 2022. 60 -- two-thirds of that is North America and that will precipitate some really -- some nice growth for us for each quarter and the balance of 2022. And knock on wood we're going to enter the year with a much healthier inventory position. So we're going to be able to execute on that portion of the growth trajectory as well.
Phil Ng: Got it, okay. And just one point up question for me. The $35 million to $40 million hit you saw in 3Q that you called out on inflation and inefficiencies, I mean, it sounds like most of this is timing related. But should most of that be flushed out when we think about 2022 or there's going to be some hangover effect still?
Scott Morrison: No I think we have got good mechanisms as we talked about to offset all of that next year. What John was talking about in our commercial strategy is we need mechanisms that react quicker to be able to offset it when we have these big spikes.
Phil Ng: Okay, super. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Roxland: Thanks very much. Just a quick question on hard seltzers, and realizing that it's a small component of your business. Can you help us think about how your new plans that you're constructing and future plans will be impacted by the fact that hard seltzer growth is now appearing to come down even further? One of the larger producers, obviously, made an announcement a couple of weeks ago on that. And just wondering how that impacts your operation and your current production whether do you need to adjust your thoughts around that business. Even though it's still a relatively small component of your business wondering if you're going to be -- you have to adjust anything that you currently built or need to build to align with what's happening in that segment?
Dan Fisher: Short answer, no. It will have no impact on our business moving forward. I would just refer you back to some of my comments on this call. Right now as we sit here today, we're 10 billion units oversold in our three major regions. The majority of that's in North America. The anti-plastic sentiment is really starting to build in a meaningful way. So a lot of brands that you have seen historically that have all been in plastic they all need to find a home. And so we've got no shortage of opportunity. I would also say as the retail providers begin to stabilize their supply chain they want innovation and our customers want to push out innovation. And a more stable supply chain ecosystem is going to provide a lot of opportunities that candidly our customers and us have been sitting on for the last 12 months to 18 months. So no hard seltzer is not going to impact our current plans or our future plans.
Mike Roxland: Got it. Appreciate that. And just one quick question on aerospace and labor. Obviously you guys cited labor being a challenge. We're hearing some chatter that there could be more significant challenges around the labor pool in the defense industry. So I'm wondering if -- obviously some of the labor pool there is very specialized labor working in highly technically skills. So I'm wondering if with respect to labor you're encountering any of those issues in aerospace.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Short answer no. I think there was a short-term dislocation and it's happening everywhere. And I can tell you we've probably had a couple of hundred retirements that we knew were going to come within the next five years, but it's happened because folks are exhausted of COVID. And so we saw that. We have been hiring for the last three years 1,000 folks a year. We'll continue to hire 1.000 folks next year. And so the balance of retirement versus attrition and what that net number can have an impact on the rate. But I think the team understands this. I think this is a spot anomaly just to be fully transparent. We're seeing it in other parts of the business. And I think as the world starts to reset and get back to normal you'll see less and less of that. So I think we had an intermittent hit here in the last six months largely due to COVID because of unanticipated retirement. But the team has done a remarkable job recruiting. And I think what we're finding is Denver and the excitement about being part of Ball and some of the projects we're working on is a hell of a talent magnet.
Mike Roxland: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Adam Samuelson: So my first question is just thinking about some of the cost pressures that have taken a lot of time on this call and your proactive intention to work with your customers on the contracts to get those inflation escalators back. On top of which you have absorbed a lot of start-up costs this year as you significantly added capacity across the network. Historically kind of we thought from a volume leverage perspective kind of profit growth for Ball can be nearly 2x volume growth. Over time clearly -- this year is maybe not quite living up to that or there's real headwinds to that kind of operating leverage. Do you think you can make sufficient progress on those contracts with your customers in this environment to be back in that kind of operating leverage range next year? 
John Hayes: Absolutely. As we look to 2022 we get excited about it. It's just we -- this inflation came so quickly that the mechanisms were in place and that's what we've been talking about and that's what we are talking about with our customers. But that 2:1 ratio you're talking about we fully agree with that.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. All right. That's great. And then I just in this environment where you've had issues in terms of sales volumes utilization issues both up and downstream that are causing pressure which one do you see as kind of most important in terms of getting the shipment volumes back kind of where you target them? Is it really just your customers getting their issues sorted out? Is it your supply chain? I don't where do I think the key bottleneck is in terms of your shipments returning back to a more normal cadence?
John Hayes: Well, it's interesting. It really is the whole supply chain. When you think about ocean port delays with raw materials on it then you think about once it gets to the port after sitting on the ocean for months then you got driver shortages. And then you -- as we talked before you some of our customers experienced CO2 issues and others are having labor issues in their own filling breweries. As a result of that -- and then combine our low inventories and what we have to do is play a bit of whack-a-mole. That's what 2021 has been around. To Stan's point earlier about being deliberate and intentional about building inventory so we have sufficient safety stock to eliminate that variability that's the key thing we're focused on in 2022.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. Great. I will appreciate all that color. I’ll pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope you’re well. Dan or John, just not to beat a dead horse here. But on the contract – the North American contract issue, can you just help me with – if I go back three years, freight was a big problem for the industry and you subsequently renegotiated some or many of your contracts and so freight was no longer an issue. So I'm just trying to understand, what cost recovery mechanisms you had in place as a consequence of having restructured all those contracts compared to what you're dealing with now? I mean did you not have recovery of all non-aluminum costs in those contracts, or I guess why would you have a year in arrears recovery built into these newer contracts, or is it just that these contracts have not been renegotiated in several years? I'm just trying to better understand the sequence of events over the past few years.
John Hayes: Well, there are several things. There are some of those longer contracts that haven't – but those are largely over. Really what it has to do with is in some of our supply contracts there's hardship clause that have – if petrochemicals go up more than a certain percent that they have the right to surcharge. And we have the right to move that on to our customers but it's only on a yearly basis. And what we're talking about doing it more quickly because all this – a lot of this happened in the third quarter. It happened this summer and it was the most acute. It's been in 40 or 50 years. And so again, I want to reiterate, this is not a function of can we get it back, it's a function of the timing of when we get it back. And that's what we're talking about.
Adam Josephson: And how are you able to do that? John, I appreciate that. Just without renegotiating in other words about renewing that – you're talking about doing so before the contract is up for renewal, is that right? And how does that work compared to how it's done when the contract is actually up for renewal?
John Hayes: Yes. Yes. Every customer and every contract is a bit different, so I'm not going to go into specific customer by customer. But many of our customers are partners. And as we invest with them longer term, you work as partnerships and say help us out in the short term and we can help you out in the long term because they need can.
Adam Josephson: Right. Understood, John. Appreciate that. And just one last question on – we no longer get the CMI data, but can you hazard guess as to what you think the industry was up in the third quarter just compared to previous quarters and compared to last year for that matter. Just again, we no longer have the benefit of getting the industry information to be just interesting to know what you think the market did in the third quarter and previously for that matter.
John Hayes: Well, it's interesting because then you got to start thinking about imports and all these other things. And as we said before, we think imports – if you annualize what's happened after the last three quarters, we think the imports will be around 16 billion in North America alone. Now that would have never been captured in CMI data anyway. And so I think when you think about that and you think about the context of what – we had a 1% – we've actually had 7% growth year-to-date in North America. I can't tell you off the top of my head what our competitors have had. But you can layer all that in and you can very quickly see that this growth is stronger than any given quarter. And Dan said, it best it's not going to be linear every quarter.
Dan Fisher: And the only thing I would add to that Adam is, we talked about the industry being up 100 billion units from the end of 2019 at our Investor Day, a little over a year ago. We are ahead of that right now, despite one of the largest supply chain disruptive periods and COVID. And so, the only thing I would continue to say is demand and the outlook looks far better than it did last quarter, two quarters ago, 18 months ago. And I think, North America is going to continue to grow and it's going to be in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future.
Adam Josephson: I appreciate that. Thank you, Dan.
Dan Fisher: Dina, it’s -- we’re five minutes after the hour, maybe we – if there is one more question, we’ll take that.
Operator: Sounds good. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde: Thanks. Good morning, John. Good morning Dan.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: Just very quickly two issues. Can you just talk with us about how you expect the import volumes to kind of cadence going forward? I mean that 16 billion units is probably 2x, what I think most of us were expecting just maybe six months ago? And then the second question is, if you could just update us on your events -- your efforts to help improve the recycling rate on beverage cans in North America, because to me this looks like a little bit of a potential Achilles' heel if it's not addressed?
Dan Fisher: Great question on the import of cans. It surprised us to the upside as well. I think we entered the year thinking maybe more in the 10 billion to 12 billion range and that speaks to the strength of aluminum and maybe lends itself to your next question. But as we sit here today, we're putting a ton of capacity online. Our competitors are putting capacity online, and early insights into 2022 is we're significantly oversold again. And so I think there will be some need for importation again. We will be importing as well. We may be importing in other regions, because the growth is so significant in some of the other regions. So, yes, as we get a clearer picture, we'll indicate kind of what we think that is, but this is early stages of our planning period for 2022. And it's clear that our customers don't want to be paying that much in freight. So if we can domicile that, it's just going to be a matter of how fast we can domesticate that volume. But there will certainly be need probably for 2022 and I would assume 2023 for some importations at some level.
John Hayes: And Mark to your point about the growth, you're absolutely right. It does reinforce the need for recycling, and a couple of things. I just -- I'll remind people that while the recycling rate in the United States is the lowest in the world, it's still 8x to 10x of any other substrate in any meaningful way. So it's important to note that and 70-plus percent of all the aluminum in a can is recycled content currently. I think the recycling is a very complicated issue, but there's three things. You got to focus on the infrastructure, you got to focus on the collection, and then you got to focus on the producer responsibility. With the infrastructure in the existing bills that are being brand about in Washington D.C. today, there are money set aside, to help the local municipalities, reinvest on the infrastructure of recycling. And so we're very hopeful that that will get through, because that will provide the necessary means for these municipalities that have to focus on health care, and schools, and roads, and sewers, and everything else provide them the necessary means to recapitalize the recycling infrastructure that hasn't been recapitalized since the 1960s. Then it gets to the collection side. And we can have debates about curbside collection versus deposits. But if you get the infrastructure in place then you got to get the collection. And we do a very poor job across the United States in collection. And at the same time, then it gets to who's going to pay for all this. Well, then it gets to extended producer responsibility. And if there's no economic value in a recycling stream of certain substrates then they are a free rider and they ought to be paying for it. Those are the discussions we're having with our state and federal legislators about the recycling infrastructure, the collection and the producer responsibility. And so this is not a short-term game. It's a long-term game. I wish it would move faster, but it is what it is. But we are putting our shoulder into this to make sure that people understand the value of aluminum in a recycling stream.
Mark Wilde: All right. That's helpful. Thanks John. Good luck in rest of the year.
Dan Fisher: Okay. Great. Well, thank you everyone for your participation. Dina, thank you for hosting us, and we look forward to engaging with you over the next quarter. Take care.
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 5, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s second quarter 2021 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don’t already have our earnings release, it’s available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today’s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’ll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then I’ll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company. To all of our global employees, thank you for your hard work and for staying safe. We know the past 16 months have been trying on everyone and it’s not lost on us that we are not out of the woods yet. COVID is still with us and the science of the vaccine speaks for itself. Please get vaccinated if you can, if not for yourself, but for your loved one and coworkers. In addition, I also want to thank our packaging and aerospace customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we continue to navigate our supply chains, COVID related restrictions in certain regions due to the ongoing Delta variant, re-openings in other regions and we are experiencing all of this, while deploying new EVA creative investments, innovations and technologies that will increase the global availability of sustainable aluminum packaging, as well as deliver national security, environmental and climate intelligence. Our long-term prospects are right on track relative to our expectations. Our business have been very resilient and we have an exciting future ahead of us. In the second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share were up 32%, comparable operating earnings were up 22%, global beverage volumes were up 13%, global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 20% and aerospace finished the quarter with record backlog. Looking to the second half, growth continues across our global beverage businesses, aluminum aerosol volumes continue to rise as regions reopen, our cup team continues to rollout our Ball Aluminum Cup in more than 20,000 points of retail distribution and is working with even more stadiums and arenas to ramp up the food service side of the business, aerospace has multiple launches and hiring continues at an elevated pace to staff aerospace contracts and aluminum packaging manufacturing projects in the U.S., South America and Europe. While we’re still working through several supply chain disruptions in our aerospace in North and Central American beverage packaging business that Dan will speak to, we are and will leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses. We have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. To that end and Scott will elaborate, we are accelerating our return of value capital allocation strategy, given the conviction we have for our future performance. Second quarter 2021 highlights include, our global beverage businesses completing the startup of six lines, including three in North America, one in EMEA and two in South America. Our global aluminum aerosol volumes increasing 20%, as I mentioned before. Our cups team executing national retail distribution of the Ball Aluminum Cup in all 50 states and providing 16 ounce, 20 ounce and 24 ounce aluminum cup to numerous sports and entertainment venues as COVID restrictions moderate. Our aerospace team winning new contracts to lift contracted backlog to a record $3 billion following the significant win late in the quarter. Our 2030 sustainability goals announcement including ambitions to achieve net zero carbon emissions, 90% global recycling rates and 85% recycled content, as well as establishing regional D&I goals and a vision of circularity for the aluminum beverage can. Our business is hiring nearly 1,600 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth in normal attrition due to retirements. Our Board increased our quarterly dividend 33% and reiterated our 35 million share repurchase authorization. And we plan to purchase in excess of $500 million of stock this year, while deploying $1.5 billion in EVA creative growth capital investments. In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level, standing up new greenfield plants, speeding up lines in existing facilities, bringing new aerospace infrastructure and expansions online to support our increasing backlog and hiring amazing talent to join our team. To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your families for good health and continued safety. And with that, I’ll turn it over to our President, Dan Fisher. Dan?
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR environmental health and safety professionals, and our own personal actions continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large scale capacity additions and intermittent supply chain challenges. We’re entering the second half with a lot of momentum, a few manageable challenges and a visible path to strong performance throughout 2021 and beyond. Second quarter global beverage volumes up 13% versus 2020 and ongoing strength in EMEA and South America, offset startup costs in North America, retail marketing investments for our retail cup launch, the later than anticipated award timing for a new aerospace contract and higher year-over-year costs. Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level. We’re on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity and we recently announced global projects all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary. Cans are in high demand, contracts are in place and Ball is well positioned. Our focus on speed the market, talent, training, systems and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now and you are making this happen. Keep up the great work. As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,600 colleagues year-to-date with the majority of them located in the United States. Our investment in talent, training and development, and emerging into the Ball culture and EVA mindset is a vital part of near- and long-term success. We are blessed as an organization to attract this talent in the current environment and are committed to their success. Can demand across all beverage categories remain strong. Our focus on improving customer experience by expanding can availability via new production coming online and providing our network latitude to build adequate inventory will continue to aid that trend. We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability. Following EMEA’s lead in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI Certification by year end 2021. In each of our global businesses set specific regional D&I goals as part of our 2030 sustainability goals announcement. Proof points of our progress include women representing over 40% of the new team and one of our Brazilian plant investments. In an aerospace over 40% of our summer interns and new hires representing ethnic and gender diversity. We commend our global colleagues’ commitment to our sustainability journey and also wish to recognize our supply chains recent investments and sustainability focused initiatives. As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating and our product portfolio continues to support our customers’ new brands, as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. Given market characteristics and our project execution, I continue to be very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit vol -- global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. Ball is well-positioned to capture growth, given our scale and innovation in the world’s largest can markets. Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable and longstanding pass-through mechanisms are in place for aluminum and other items. And as we said on last quarter’s earnings call, now we execute. Now for a few brief comments on each region. In North America beverage second quarter volumes were up 5% versus 2020 and up 6.4% versus 2019 during the quarter. Earnings were up slightly and as expected higher volume offset the combined effect of project startup costs and operational efficiencies in plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory entering peak season. Glendale and Pittston are both operational, and as of today, three lines are running and Glendale and Pittston first line is coming up its learning curve. Both plants will exit 2021 with four can manufacturing lines installed and our Bowling Green ends manufacturing plant will start up early in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining half of the anticipated $50 million in start up costs will flow through in the second half of 2021. Across our broad customer base, beverage can demand is strong in all brand categories, alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. Despite recent chatter on hard seltzers nothing has changed about our plans. We expect favorable growth trends across all categories to continue, which will drive more EVA enhancing opportunities supported by long duration contracts with strategic customers and large regional accounts. In the near-term, the work to build adequate inventory levels will offset some of the benefits of having new capacity online during the third quarter and position the business for success. Looking out longer term, Ball will build another beverage can manufacturing plant in the southeast. Our new North Carolina facility is supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate the facility to come online in late 2023 or 2024. In EMEA, segment volume for the second quarter was up 18% versus 2020 on easier comps given prior year’s volume declines due to COVID onset, timing and we’re also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus second quarter 2019, volumes were up 9%. Across Ball’s EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. We foresee European beverage can volumes up high-single digits throughout second half of 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. Our new greenfield plants in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key accounts. Our EMEA team is executing very well and fully prepared for these exciting investments. In South America, second quarter volumes were up 15% versus 2020 and up 16% versus 2019, given easier comps due to the prior year’s COVID impact and despite cooler than normal seasonal temperatures, and delivery channels in large cities limiting alcohol purchases. We continue to see more earnings upside in South America. As john mentioned, two new lines ramped up in existing facilities in South America during the quarter, and the Frutal, Brazil plant is preparing for a late third quarter startup. Additional investments both in Brazil and throughout the region are also anticipated. Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid-teens for the full year and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online. In summary, our global beverage team did a terrific job navigating some uncontrollables during the quarter, while also executing, as well as we can on the things we can’t control. Our aluminum aerosol team did an excellent job supplying growth across EMEA resulting in 20% higher volumes in the second quarter globally versus 2020 and 12% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period. The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. In addition, the business continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottle to deliver innovation across multiple brand and product categories, including the second quarter rollout of refillable, reclosable personal care packaging at a leading U.S. mass retailer. Our cups team continues to raise awareness, establish distribution, execute initial sell-through and invest for continued growth in 2021 and beyond. In addition to the 50 states retail launch, John mentioned, the team continued to invest in The Party Starts Here marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers about infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We continue to expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. Turning to aerospace, the team continued to win contracts and year-to-date contracted backlog is up 25%. The aerospace business dealt with lingering effects of inefficient supply chains, though exiting the quarter we saw notable improvement with key subcontractors and we are exciting -- excited to book a key contract when at the end of the quarter. This win and the trajectory of recent performance sets up the business for notable sales and earnings growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond, in addition to margin improvement beyond 2021. At Ball Aerospace, we are managing challenges, nurturing our culture, while capturing the future. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done by not only the aerospace team, but everyone across the organization. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable second quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus $0.65 in 2020, an increase of 32%. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage results, slightly lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate costs, as well as labor and startup costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball’s balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 17%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $95 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 25. Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with earnings trajectory and be aided by a source and working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new growth projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash, as fellow owners and in alignment with our EVA discipline, we will prudently balance real time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the second quarter’s strength and net leverage in our target range, we will return significant value to shareholders via dividends, as John mentioned earlier, and our ongoing 2021 share repurchase program of at least $500 million. In 2021, we will return approximately $1 billion to shareholders, including dividends and buybacks, and we intend to double that total return to shareholders in 2022. With that, I’ll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In summary, our Drive for 10 vision serves us very well, whether it be broadening our geographic expansion, developing new customers, markets and products, and doing so with a commitment to being close to our customers and with uncompromising integrity. Following our strong year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are even better positioned to exceed our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15% and exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond. We will work safely together to execute on projects, support our customers’ growth, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and return even more value to our shareholders. And with that, Kathy, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: So, Dan, maybe we can pick up on the hard seltzer comment. Obviously, the narrative of the market has changed quite a bit. Maybe you can give us a sense as to how many units you think hard seltzers will total for beverage cans in North America for -- as we exit 2021? What does that number look like for 2022? And then what gives you confidence that the momentum will continue in context of companies like Molson Coors already rationalizing some of their brands? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, Ghansham. I think for -- how we looked at that category is and I think I’ve made this comment before. We look at sort of the ready-to-drink alcohol space. And maybe just to give you some context, for Ball Corporation, hard seltzers of our unit volume make up less than 5%. We’ve seen -- obviously, we participated in the growth of that space. But it is not the underpinnings for the things that we’ve been talking about in terms of long-term securitization of contracts, EVA accretion. It’s not on the backs of that category specifically. And so I think it will continue to grow, it’s clearly not going to grow at the rate it has been. I think what’s been clear in that space is, the folks that continue to innovate and innovate effectively, are the ones that are taking share. And so from that perspective, we’re -- we believe that we have a right to play in the innovation space and I think we’d benefit from those customers in particular. And so that’s where our focus is. I’m leery to comment on unit volumes across the entire space for the back half of the year. But maybe that gives you a sense of how we at Ball kind of view that category. We’re continuing to bet on the long-term trajectory of the can and can wins in every channel. This is one that has done really well over the handful of years, but we like a lot of other categories and a lot of other spaces equally.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. That makes sense. And then if we switch to Europe and the big improvement versus 2019. I mean, obviously, at energy cup last year, but really, what is driving the margin improvement versus 2019, even with aluminum costs that are much higher, and obviously, dilutive. What’s driving that improvement there?
Dan Fisher: This may be too simple an answer, but our team is executing really, really well, in some instances, a little ahead of our expectations even. We’ve got a really stable footprint over there. We’re on the forefront of major greenfield expansions. But that’s a stable. We’ve had the benefits of incremental speed ups and incremental line extensions and that’s a much easier operating environment, coupled with the fact that the team over there is doing a terrific job. So, I think, solid contracts that we’ve leaned into and talked about globally, the team performing extremely well. And the fact that they’ve benefited from the incremental growth expansion as opposed to some of the large greenfield footprint. So I think the combination of those three and that team just continuing to perform exceedingly well.
Ghansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed. 
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Of your 12 billion can capacity expansion by the end of the year, how much of that volume is already committed?
Dan Fisher: Overwhelmingly, it’s committed. Well, we haven’t -- I think we’ve been pretty consistent on the capacity we’re putting in the ground, whether you’ve heard from Scott or John at other Investor Days and outlets. We haven’t deviated from that position. The long-term contracts are committed. They effectively in many instances have take or pay clauses in them. Good terms and conditions and equilibrium of risk. That’s improved over the course of the last four years to five years in terms of the contract integrity. But, yeah, they’re overwhelmingly contracted. I’d say, 85% to 90% of each one of the facilities is contracted.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. And to follow up, I think, your long-term projection for the growth in North American can market is 4% to 6%. So call it 5%. Of the 5% growth you expect on a normal basis, how much of the growth comes from alcoholic beverages and how much from non-alcoholic beverages to get to the 5%?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Good question. I think going back to 2019, when we had an Investor Day and we laid out the growth trajectory and we’ve been pretty consistent that, I believe it’s going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of two-thirds alcohol, one-third other. It may be shifting a little bit more to 60% alcohol and 40%, and the reason for that is energy, the energy market continues to absolutely be on fire. And so that’s the only fundamental change I see in like the underlying architecture. The good news is that means volumes more than what we anticipated a couple years ago, but that segment in particular and there’s more fitness energy drinks coming online. You are a consumer, you see all of this and we’re obviously going to benefit from it.
John Hayes: Yeah. I’ll just add, let’s not forget that that 4% to 6% did not include any water, any still water and we are even just driving in the car today, I actually heard a radio commercial about still -- a new still water brand coming in. And so I think that provides, it was delayed about a year because of COVID, but we are starting to see it. A little bit less so here in North America, but certainly in Europe and we expect that to be upside to that 4% to 6% volume growth.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: John, Dan, after bringing up and ramping the additional lines in North America in 2Q, 3Q, would you expect to still be importing cans at year end? Can you just kind of give a snapshot of where your global footprint stands from import/export standpoint? And when you get to a point where you no longer need to import into North America?
Dan Fisher: I think we’ll be importing far less in the back half of the year. And having said that, the can growth, we’re still in the early innings of growth, so as all our channels and all our markets continue to open up and we’d lean more into new innovations, et cetera. Those could spur some inputs, but we’re not planning on near as much to the extent that we saw in the first half of the year.
John Hayes: Yeah. But having said that, even going into 2022, we still expect some imports as we kind of catch up with all this. If you go back probably, I’ll call it, 18 months ago and asked us, we would have probably said the amount of imports in 2022 would be negligible, if any, but we’re seeing more just because the overall demand growth and we want to be prudent in our investments. And as Dan mentioned earlier, we make the investments based upon secured contracts. And so as those come through, that provides an underpinning, but I would expect that we’re still doing some level of importing in 2022.
Dan Fisher: Absolutely.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then with the Delta variant, we’re seeing some renewed lock downs, I guess, maybe in some Asian markets where you don’t participate as much. I’m just wondering if you’re seeing or does your guidance anticipate any impact on-premise demand in any of your global markets from renewed lockdowns?
John Hayes: No. No. It doesn’t. Because as you know, I think, it’s actually only upside. The kegs seldomly, certainly, here in North America, less than in Europe, but is very -- does not skew towards the on-premise. And so I think as the on-premise comes on, I think, they’re upside, because of the anecdotal evidence that we have seen and heard is that as the on-premise does begin to open up, the kegs are the ones at risk, because they had to flush so much bad product because of the lock downs. And so, bar owners and restaurant owners are looking at much more flexible and adaptable supply chains within their own walls and I certainly think that favors a can So in fact, I think, as things open or close, there’s little downside, but more upside.
Dan Fisher: Maybe just adding a comment to John’s good take on on-premise, I think, we’re also seeing the continued investment into the direct channel and there have been behavioral changes. That’s…
Operator: This is the Operator. The main line has disconnected. They will be dialing back in. So please stay on the line. The main line has disconnected, but they’ll be joining shortly. So please remain on the line. So be on silent until they rejoin. I will let you know once they have joined. Thank you for standing by. I do have the main line connected. Please go ahead.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Apologies for that. I did we seem somehow dropped off. But we’re back. So, Kathy, if you can, perhaps, like take the next question.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Neel Kumar: Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned several supply chain disruptions in the aerospace and Northern Central America segments. Can you just quantify for us the impact in the quarter and what impact you expect from these issues in the second half of the year?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. On the aerospace side, I think, we saw continued struggles early in the quarter, got much better in the back half of the quarter. We think going -- we feel much better going forward that we’re kind of beyond the challenges that we have in the supply chain. In North and Central America, we’re seeing increased costs as it relates to warehousing, coatings, all kinds of things. I think everybody’s seeing that across their supply chain. So we’ve been able to -- our teams have done a great job of making sure that we have metal to run our operations. So we haven’t had any issues from that standpoint. But it’s a challenging environment, but one that we’re navigating through pretty well.
John Hayes: I think in total, I think, in aerospace, we think it costs in the range of probably $5 million in the quarter. And I think in North America beverage, our startup costs were in the $11 million to $12 million, excuse me, $12 million to $13 million range. And then all the other inefficiency costs that, Scott alluded to, and don’t forget, we entered the quarter with the lowest inventory we had. And so as you’re going into a seasonally high period of time in North America, that’s what created the disruption, but that costs is probably in the range of $20 million $25 million. And as Dan talked in this prepared remarks, a big focus in the second half of this year is new capacity is coming online, is getting our inventories back to a more normalized level, so that we are not making to order, but we’re making to stock, which is very important from a whole supply chain efficiency perspective.
Dan Fisher: It’s important to add to that. When we talk about we’re doing an effective job, controlling what we’re controlling, especially within the four walls of our plants, it’s exactly the John’s comment, when you have historically low inventory levels that just promotes more label changes and more turnover. So our folks are operating incredibly well. They’re just doing it in challenging inventory level circumstances.
Neel Kumar: Great. That’s helpful. And you mentioned, aluminum cups being profitable in 2022. I was curious what the drag is in 2021 and how much CapEx has been invested so far? And can we just generally expect a greater than 10% return on that investment on an ongoing basis?
Dan Fisher: So I’ll answer a couple or add a couple comments and then maybe turn it over to Scott. Number one, we’re having to see the market in terms of promoting and building the brand. And so you can see commercials and traditional media, you can see an awful lot of activity in that arena. So we’re spending that money as we launch, we only have one time to launch in these 20,000 stores. So we’ve leaned in heavier in the second quarter even than probably what you see in the back half of the year in terms of investment to build the brand. And then it’s a function of volume against the fixed cost, right? So as we’re seeing volume continue to pick up and seeing some nice velocity turns on this retail. We have pretty good line of sight into where we’re going to be exiting the year and that real good line of sight in terms of this is going to be able to transition into a profitable business in 2022.
Scott Morrison: Yeah. We’ve invested about $250 million so far just the start -- it just in the realm cups plants so far and we expect to have returns, yes, well in excess of that 9% as it matures. To Dan’s point, I think the team has done an amazing job, given kind of COVID restrictions of getting into 20,000 retail locations in a really short period of time. That doesn’t come without some additional investment. But we expect that investments to be well worth it as we get into 2022 and beyond and start to see those returns.
John Hayes: Yeah. And then one thing I’ll just add on that is, let’s also not forget the food service side, the sports and entertainment venues, they’re just in earnest over the last month or so, just starting to open up even on the concert side, they’re just starting as we speak. And so as we go into the second half of the year, that’s going to be a big focus. And then assuming normal, no restrictions or very limited restrictions in 2022, that’s where we see the road to profitability.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Staphos: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Hope you’re doing well.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
George Staphos: Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to hit again on innovation. And I think sometimes it’s good to remember six years, seven years ago, I think, you all were talking about how, especially on the alcohol side, there wasn’t innovation, relative CSD and that’s obviously changed a lot and churn is good. When you look at your customers new product pipeline, especially in alcohol, are you more or less confident looking out a year to two years then you were a year ago, in terms of the innovation and what it’ll mean for your growth and return and why or why not?
John Hayes: I’ll give a very high level view. I’m probably a little bit more excited why. It’s not only just because of innovation. It seems like every new brand that’s coming out in cans. And so the amount of the number, sheer number of new product inquiries we get from big, big customers, regional customers, small customers has been the greatest I’ve seen in my 20 plus years at Ball Corporation.
Dan Fisher: I was building on that George versus three years or four years ago, every large CPG company now is getting into the alcohol space. So just by virtue of that, we’re seeing a lot more innovation on that side. And as John said, almost everything is going into cans. So I’m more bullish. I don’t know which one’s going to win. But we know that the can is going to win and we continue to place our bets on that.
George Staphos: Are you seeing any innovation pipeline, any sort of mixture between previously separated categories? So energy drinks and alcohol, energy drinks and coffee, and what that might mean for your can business going forward?
Dan Fisher: I think, yeah, you’re probably just scratching the surface on the hybrid. Anything you can get alcohol into is being contemplated. Yeah, just same thing on the, sorry, same on the fitness side, anything that can have fewer calories to give you energy or some benefits, there is no shortage of innovation there.
John Hayes: Yeah. George, just give you a context. People have been talking a lot about spike seltzer. What we’re also not talking about is the ready-to-drink that is just totally booming as we sit here right now. As Dan mentioned, energy is going very strong, and we’re seeing more and more coffee going in, with all sorts of functional benefits, whether it’s various oils being put into it or other things like that. And so, again, across the spectrum, that’s what we’re seeing.
George Staphos: Okay. Thanks for that. Hopefully, no alcohol and milk drinks. But we’ll see. I guess the last question…
Dan Fisher: There is such a…
George Staphos: I know.
Dan Fisher: … thing in wide production, George.
George Staphos: I forgot. I forgot. We’ll look for that in the can at some point, if it’s not already out there. So, you mentioned that you’re going to look to double the value return next year versus this year. And I was wondering what is ultimately driving that, recognizing it’s going to be a combination of things, is that the confidence in the return that you’re generating from your investments giving you the wherewithal to do that. Is that the implicit, higher cost of equity now being put on Ball stock, because the way the stock has been performing and so maybe it’s time to pull back and reward shareholders or is it -- doesn’t sound like it lack of confidence in the growth outlook and so maybe it’s time to start redeploying that capital and I recognize it’s going to be probably something totally different. But what are your thoughts there and I’ll turn it over from there? Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarters.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, George.
Scott Morrison: Sure, George. I think it’s more conviction and confidence in our business, and the prospects of our business longer term. I think it’s -- we’re in a comfortable leverage, we said, we wanted to be 3 times to 3.5 times year end debt-to-EBITDA. We see our earnings growth over the next several years growing at a pretty good clip and so we have the ability to basically borrow more money and keeping the leverage flat and returning a ton of that value to shareholders kind of like what we’ve done in the past historically. So I think its conviction about all of those things that gives us the confidence to do -- to raise the dividend 33% a week ago, and to ramp up the share buyback. And I think this year will be a good start and I think we did a lot more as we as we go forward.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. And people have been around for long enough over the last 20 years, 25 years know that this lather rinse repeat strategy of making good investments, getting your debt down to the optimal capital levels and then giving it back to shareholders. That is a tried and true model. And we’re -- the key point that I was making in my prepared remarks is we had planned on really doing that in 2022. But we have enough conviction in the growth of cash flow, the growth of earnings and our balance sheet, as Scott said, that we’re going to be accelerating that.
Scott Morrison: And we don’t have to sacrifice growth investments. We’re still going to -- we’re able to invest heavily in the growth supported by those long duration contracts that Dan talked about. We’re going to flow a lot of cash and a lot of that extra cash is going to go back to the shareholders.
George Staphos: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you very much.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, George.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: I want to circle back to the inventory conversation. So can you maybe just touch on kind of how far inventory levels currently are below where you want them? And relatedly, I assumed just given the demand strength over the past couple years, your North America plants have been running and producing, I would rather says, probably, almost unsustainably high rates. So is it fair to say in a more normalized environment, when you get all your plants up and running? You would ideally like to dial some of those operating rates back just to keep things smoothly running or just -- how should we think at a plant level, how you would like to operate to steady state versus kind of how you’re operating today to kind of make deal?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. At a high level we are essentially running this business during peak season as it makes the order instead of make the stock business. And because of that, you see very different behaviors from in consumers in North America. So the volatility of what products win and what products win at a lesser degree, if you don’t have safety stock available to lean into that, that manifests and the more label changes and more conversions. And that’s what our plants are up against right now. We have known we’ve got some significant footprint investments coming online here. As I think both, John and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, three lines came on in North America this quarter. They’ll start to gain efficiency and then we’ll have built out into facilities, eight lines by the end of this year. That will give us a much needed breathing room. And as those come online and we can build the stock in, the traditional December, January time periods, we will see the benefits in peak season next year in North America. And we’re not done on expanding, obviously, to continue to make sure that we’ve got the appropriate asset utilization. And you’ll see the efficiency levels pick up in our plants because they’ll actually have five years to do what we’re planning to do.
John Hayes: Yeah. Just to give you some numerical context around that, historically, meaning over the last, I don’t know, five years, seven years, we would run on average inventory days in North America in the mid-20s, call it. We’re down this summer in the mid single digits. To Dan’s point, you can’t efficiently run a system a network like that when your inventory levels are so low. What we’re planning on doing in the second half of this year is get them back to the mid-teens, call it, 15 plus or minus, because that’s where we think more optimal levels can be. I don’t think we’ll get back to the 25, because I think the world is a bit different and the velocities, to Dan’s point of label changes is different, but certainly…
Operator: And this is the, Operator, unfortunately, it did disconnect again. I will wait for them to dial back in. So please just remain on the line. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Yeah. Sorry about that. I’m not sure what -- we got dropped off again. But I think I was in finishing up, and saying, in this summer, we’ve been in the mid-single digits and we expect to get back by the end of this year, hopefully, to the 15 days, which we think is a much more optimal level, because otherwise, we’re just stressing our system too tightly.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Adam Samuelson: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Adam Samuelson: Maybe first, just hoping to get some just color on the aerospace business. And you alluded to some of the kind of subcontractor and supply chain challenges labor issues there, but a much more constructive revenue outlook for the back half of the year and you talked about margins are expanding in 2022. Is there been any change in terms of the revenue outlook for the business for this year, is anything slipping into next? And then I got a follow-up just after that?
Dan Fisher: No to the revenue and a little on the profit that negligible. What two things that influenced it, as Scott already indicated. Number one and I think I’ve made a comment in a prior call, we were operating pre-COVID, with about 80% of our employees, colocated on campus. We exited Q1 at about 50%. We’re exiting Q2 about 65%. So we’re trending in a way that’s allowing us to be a heck of a lot more efficient and collaborative in terms of our efforts. The same phenomenon is happening with our subcontractors. So the combination of that gives us great confidence in the back half of the year. And why we’re bullish on the revenue outlook and why it’s in line, and in reference to John’s comments of, nothing has changed. We did secure a significant project kind of last week of the quarter and that will give us the ability to continue to execute in line with our previous comments and expectations on the business.
John Hayes: Yeah. To that point, we had expected to put that in the backlog in the beginning of the second quarter is really more towards the end of the second quarter. And so that was in some part relative to our expectations a little delay, but it was the right thing to do for a variety of reasons, but nothing has changed as we go forward. We’re really excited about that business.
Adam Samuelson: Okay. That’s really helpful. And then to the earlier question point on the acceleration in cash return next year and it’s a big step up, you announced, the 33% dividend increase last week. Should we be thinking that dividend is a even bigger kind of component of that or do we think this goes with where the dividend payout is now that’s comfortably north of $1.5 billion of buyback next year is the kind of base plan for at the moment?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. We, I mean, we have -- we look at the dividend all the time and we don’t adjust it on a regular basis. We look at it from time to time and then make larger, I guess, adjustments. Most of that returns obviously going to come in the form of share buyback, but we’ll keep a balance between dividends and share buyback. But you’re right, we’re kind of at the front end of acceleration of both of those, as we see, have more confidence as we look out into the future about our cash flow and EVA generation.
Adam Samuelson: Yeah. That color is really helpful. I’ll pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope you’re well. I think, Neel, asked earlier about the cup launch and the costs associated with it. And Scott, I think, you address the capital costs, but not necessarily the P&L costs. So could you just give us a sense of what perhaps the swing could be, if you turn a profit next year, compared to whatever drag you’re experiencing this year?
Scott Morrison: Well, I think, this year we’ll invest probably in total, close to $30 million in the startup of the plant of getting it into retail and all of that. I think the marketing costs that we’re experiencing this year mostly in the second quarter, but some also in the third quarter. We will reduce greatly next year. And I think our volumes will grow quite a bit next year. As John mentioned kind of, on-premise food service, stadiums, venues, those kinds of things come back. We’re having nice success on the retail side, nice success on the online. And so I don’t think it’d be a nice contributor year-over-year, I would expect it to be a nice swing.
Adam Josephson: Okay. Appreciate that, Scott. And Dan, I think the Jeff was asking earlier about the composition of the long-term -- expect a long-term growth in the North American beverage can market, and you mentioned, perhaps, now you’re thinking it’s about 60% alcohol and you’ve talked about hard seltzer and beer and ready to drink cocktails. Can you just talk about what is informing your view of how each of those categories will contribute to that growth? I mean, how -- what kind of foresight your customers would have about the rate at which each of those products is likely to grow over that period?
Dan Fisher: Sure, I mean, in the most -- in the simplest of terms, that’s roughly the construction of our revenue now. And we’re seeing it grow consistently across all product lines and channels at this point and so we see that continuing. We’re seeing equal number of innovations across all categories in all channels. I think the fact that a couple of the larger beverage companies are leaning into alcohol gives you some belief that it will -- alcohol will continue to represent a majority position of our volume concentration. But as, I think both John and I commented on this call, that 40% -- the wildcard within the 40% is going to be still water and the accumulation of that in the marketplace. So if the 40% grows at a higher clip, we’re all going to like that. Because we still believe everything’s going to grow in line with our expectations. It’s been consistent. That just means that we’re seeing further entrenchment and growth of new still water categories.
Adam Josephson: Great. Thanks a lot, Dan.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I wanted to go back to the market development around seltzer and just the whole ready-to-drink alcohol market. A lot of us are under the impression that the market is sold out until 2023 here in North America. And so when the seltzer market, I guess, moderates, how does that kind of affect the other categories? Do you think that there is a lot of new products that are pent-up that maybe get some cans? Does that give you a little breathing room? Just given the tightness that you’ve experienced for the last couple years? Is that something that’s potentially welcomed? Maybe you can just kind of square away how to interpret this slowdown and the impact on other categories?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Thanks for that. I would say, first off, I think you’re hitting on an element that is still lost the followership. But every single category, every single customer and every channel is on allocation in our three biggest markets. So there is an impact to growth. I don’t know if it’s disproportionate to one category, because I don’t know what the ultimate sell-through of those products are. But we are contributing to some of the end customer growth targets and rates just by virtue of the fact that if we had more capacity, we’d be selling it through. To the second question, maybe I’ll turn it over to John…
John Hayes: Yeah.
Dan Fisher: … to add commentary to that, but…
John Hayes: Yeah. What I was going to say is, don’t forget, we’ve always taken a portfolio approach to this. And as Dan mentioned earlier, that hard seltzer itself represents 5% or less of our North American volume. And so we’ve always played on the mainstream beer side. We played on the import beer side. We played on the spike seltzer. We trade wine on ready-to-drink alcohol, all of those. You have to look at it from a portfolio theory. And to Dan’s point, from a portfolio theory perspective that we’re on allocation and all these things are growing. And so I do think the focus on hard seltzer is probably a bit overstated here, because people are still drinking more alcohol from can products period.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. And if I could, similar question just outside of the U.S., what’s the penetration and I guess momentum that you’re observing in similar new products? Maybe you can just touch on Europe and Brazil? Have you seen any potential increase and some of these new categories in those regions at all? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yeah. The new entrants that are coming into South America are 100% can entrance and that’s been happening over the last handful years. And so their influence and maybe, more importantly, how the end consumer is consuming products through the smaller retail channels and the mini marts in that part of the world. They like hands a lot more than they liked the historical return of returnable glass offerings and so we’ve seen a manifestation. To your point, if a new products coming out, it’s disproportionately coming out in cans. In Europe, that’s the lowest can penetration market in terms of substrate penetration anywhere in the world, for us outside of Mexico. And much the same, I think, there’s ample growth and away from plastic, from glass, from on-premise kegs through direct channels. So we’re seeing that, we’re seeing the can win. I don’t know that I could point to one particular category because we’re seeing it across every category. So there’s a heavier lane in terms of cans, and the thing that emboldens us and continues to sort of echoes John’s comments at the outset that, we are right in line with our expectations. Nothing has changed. We continue to see the filling operators, overweight to manufacturing can filling lines and that’s what’s getting purchased and that’s what’s getting implemented and installed everywhere around the world.
John Hayes: Yeah. To Dan’s point on that, let me just amplify, because not four years ago, one-third of all new filling lines going in were for cans. Now it’s closer to two-thirds of all new filling lines going in for cans. And that’s a -- to Dan’s point, it’s across all categories, whether it’s beer, soft drink, energy water, craft wine, FMB’s, you name it, it’s across the Board.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed.
Salvator Tiano: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. So firstly, very quickly, if I understood correctly from the very beginning that you mentioned $1 billion in capital returns this year and I think the dividend is $200 million. So does this imply the excess of $500 million buyback is actually $800 million or did I miss any figures there?
Scott Morrison: The dividend is a little bit high -- with the dividend bump that we just did, the dividend will be a little higher than that. But the share buyback is kind of in that $700 million to $800 million range. Yes, that’s correct.
Salvator Tiano: Okay. Perfect. And in Europe, can you provide us a little bit with come color on each market, U.K., Russia, continental Europe, how we performed during the quarter?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. I mean they’re all consistently up in that mid-to-high single digits. I think ever since the third quarter last year when things started to reopen, not as much as in the U.S., but folks have figured out a way through the direct channel or other avenues to get their beverage of choice and so we’ve seen consistent growth across the continent.
John Hayes: Yeah. And I just…
Salvator Tiano: Okay.
John Hayes: I think a lot as you think about the growth in Russia that, we were on allocation, unfortunately, as we don’t have enough cans for the market. Think about the U.K. for all the things we talked about that Dan mentioned to earlier. This whole sustainability we haven’t talked much about this today. But you can clearly see in Europe, a strategic mind shift changing as we speak. Let’s not forget in 2025 the European packaging directive comes into full force in terms of recycled content and other things. And I think we’re seeing changes in behaviors by not only the consumers, but also our customers in anticipation of that.
Salvator Tiano: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Ing with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Phil Ing: Hey, guys. John you mentioned that Russia, you’re on allocation? So curious with the capacity you’re adding on, one, do you have an anchor customer and then I noticed one of your bigger competitors in the region is adding more capacity. Does the market have enough demand to support that incremental supply?
John Hayes: Without question. I’ll turn it over, Dan. He can answer it more succinctly.
Dan Fisher: Yes. We have long-term contracts with all the major players there, especially on the brewery side. And those contracts were entered in alignment with adding this capacity. And so, the challenge is going to be the markets growing faster than when we were negotiating those terms a while ago. So we’re constantly monitoring that marketplace.
Phil Ing: Got it. And Dan, you mentioned that, really great execution and running full out in Europe, given some of the investment you’re going to be making in ramping up. Is that going to have an impact on your margins when we look out to next year for Europe into a meaningful fashion?
Dan Fisher: The U.K. and the Russia facilities, they can’t come online fast enough. I got tremendous confidence in the team’s ability to ramp those up. In terms of the Czech Republic, that market can sometimes be a little bit more volatile. But we’ve got again long-term contracts and a really good team executing there. I don’t anticipate the weight of startup costs to be in line with what we’re experienced in the U.S., simply because those facilities are a little smaller and the cost profile obviously in the Czech Republic in Russia are far different than the U.S. wage rate.
Phil Ing: Got it. That’s helpful. And in North America, really solid growth, but certainly lagging some of the other markets, was that largely a function of you didn’t have enough capacity and then when some capacity you’re investing ramp up in the back half, you expect to run a little fuller. Any color on how strong that volume could look like, if you run full out in the back half this year?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. Almost 100% capacity and then not to belabor at this point, but we were less efficient just simply because we didn’t have any inventory to buffer when things took off and a product was outpacing, some of our anticipated projections. So we left a couple -- I would imagine we’ve left a couple points of growth on the table in the second quarter, because of the combination of that. In the back half as these lines ramp up, we’ve got really good contracts there. We are in constant conversations with the customers. And they’re -- they can’t wait to get those cans. So I would expect accelerated growth in the back half of the year because of the capacity we put in place.
Phil Ing: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
Dan Fisher: Okay. Thanks. Kathy, we have time for one more question if there is one.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Alton Stump: Great. I have a quick question. Just want to ask about South America, there’s a lot of talk about your capacity tightness here and also over -- of course, in Europe as well. But how is the capacity your situation that you see currently over the next 12 months, 18 months, particularly as it pertains to South America?
John Hayes: It’s tight. Yeah. During, obviously, they’re -- in non peak season, getting ready to enter into peak season and everything that we’re seeing is going to put us in incredibly tight scenario. So that team is doing a marvelous job, trying to build inventory right now in anticipation of that growth. But we’re -- as I’ve commented in my prepared remarks, we’re obviously starting up a new plant in Brazil in this quarter probably back half of this quarter. There are other line extensions and investments all throughout the region that we continue to invest in and it’s going to continue to be tight and we’re adding we’re adding volume and capacity for our strategic players. We’ve got, I guess, we’re signaling high to middle-teen growth in that region and a lot of that is coming from this returnable glass, the can shift, the can continues to win across all categories and we will benefit from that here as this capacity comes online.
Alton Stump: Okay. Great. Thanks John. That’s all I have.
John Hayes: Okay. Well, thank you, all for your participation. As you can tell, there’s a sense of excitement here that we are -- we really do believe we’re on the front edge of a meaningful capital allocation strategy to return it to shareholders. We see as we sit here today nothing has fundamentally changed from our Investor Day nine months ago and we’re just excited. I do wish and hope that everyone stays very safe and healthy. This Delta variant is a concern. But I think strategically we’ll be as a globe be able to get beyond it. So thank you all for your participation and we look forward to continued engagement.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference today. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, May 6, 2021. It is now my I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chief Executive Officer. Please go-ahead Mr. Hayes.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, France. And good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2021 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks; Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends; Scott will discuss key financial metrics; and then I'll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company. First, let me begin by thanking our employees. Together we are working safely and executing at a high level in preparation for even more growth. Thank you for taking care of one another and living the Ball culture day in and day out. I also want to thank our customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we are successfully navigating pandemic-related restrictions in certain regions, post vaccine re-openings in other regions supplies, supply shortages and disruptions across the entirety of our supply chains and investing in growth brands, sustainable aluminum packaging and scientific discovery. The past 15 months have further showcased the resiliency of our industries, as well as our ability to communicate, manage appropriately to serve growing consumer and customer demand. 2021 is off to a strong start with comparable diluted earnings per share up 18%; comparable operating earnings up 12% and global beverage volumes up 8%, despite a couple of disruptions in North and Central America beverage and aerospace that were outside of our control. Momentum continues across our global beverage businesses, project execution is high, aerospace backlog is solid and hiring continues at a robust pace. All of which will fuel long-term shareholder value creation. Even though we left a little on the table in the first quarter, nothing has changed about our prospects. In fact, we have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. Scott will discuss this more later on. First quarter of 2021 highlights include our global beverage business completing the startup of four new lines in the speed up of numerous others around the world. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully integrating the Brazil aluminum aerosol plant acquisition, our cups team executing national distribution of the Ball Aluminum Cup at seven out of the ten largest U.S. food and beverage retailers late in the quarter. Our aerospace team continued to successfully test key instruments and win NASA contracts and study programs. And our businesses hired nearly a 1,000 people net in the quarter to support our long-term growth. We continue to put our shoulders into the areas of sustainability and real circularity to ensure that aluminum beverage packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world. As many know, and you will hear us speak endlessly about aluminum beverage cans already contain on average more than 70% recycled content, which is multiples above any other beverage package. During the quarter we launched the first ASI-certified cans in AMEA and Ball commissioned Eunomia to produce the first U.S. state-by-state comparable assessment of recycling rates for common containers and packaging materials. Please visit our website at ball.com/realcircularity, to view our recently published 50 states recycling report. The state and federal lawmakers consider recycling legislation an infrastructure investment. It's important for everyone to understand what is working and what is not when it comes to recycling in the U.S. And as an industry leader, we believe with good data, smart policies and infrastructure investment the U.S. can be a leader in the global circular economy. Aluminum packaging is economically advantage, properly designed and as mentioned offers the highest recycled content beverage solutions available to our customers today. Increasing U.S. and global recycling rates will only accelerate growth for aluminum packaging versus other substrates and promote a truly circular economy. So, in summary, Ball is operating from a position of strength. Our future is very bright and our time is now. To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety.  And with that, I'll turn it over to our new President, Dan Fisher. Dan?
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers, and suppliers, our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals, and our own personal actions continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. As John mentioned, it was a very rewarding start to the year. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large scale capacity additions, and a few curve balls along the way. We're exiting the first quarter with a lot of momentum and we'll continue to see strong performance throughout 2021. In addition to global beverage volumes being up 8%, specialty mix increased above 49%, up from 46% at year-end 2020. An ongoing strength in EMEA and South America beverage more than offset the winter storm impact to North America beverage, accelerated marketing investments for our retail cup launch and COVID-induced subcontractor costs in aerospace. Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. Despite Ball exiting 2020, with seven billion units of additional installed capacity, we continue to be sold out and look forward to bringing more projects online. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level. And we anticipate exiting 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity. All of which underscores our Investor Day commentary cans are in high demand, contracts are in place and Ball is well on its way to installing at least 25 billion units of global capacity by year end 2023. That's off of a base of 100 billion in 2019. Our focus on speed to market, talent, training, systems, supply chain and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now, and you are making this happen. Keep up the great work. We continue to secure new customer and supply chain contracts as well as properly aligned talent resources for the future. As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,000 colleagues year-to-date with the majority of them located in the United States. Training and development and immersion into the Ball culture is a vital part of our day-to-day work.  Can demand across all beverage categories is strong. Our focus on improving customer experience is bearing fruit. Online tools like the source, transparent customer communication, and even more can availability will continue to aid that trend. We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing sustainability. I'm proud to say that in addition to our EMEA segment, achieving ASI Certification in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI Certification by year end 2021.  In addition, last week, we recognized the 2020 Hoover Sustainability Award global winners. We commend all of our global colleagues and our global supply chain for their commitment to our sustainability journey. As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating and our product portfolio continues to support our customers, new brands, as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles, and cups. Given market characteristics and our project execution, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low-double digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. As a reminder, for those of you newer to the industry that is 2x the historical CAGR, and puts the industry on track to grow at least 100 billion units by 2025. Ball is well-positioned to capture at least 45 billion units of that growth, given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets. Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable and long-standing pass through mechanisms for aluminum and other items are in place. These include our list customer terms and conditions that will enable us to ensure full pass through as inflation begins to ramp up. And as we said on last quarter's earnings, now we execute, execute, execute. Now a few comments on each region. In North America, beverage first quarter volumes were up 6% and specialty mix improved to 37%. During the quarter, earnings were down slightly due to the combined effect of project startup costs and lost production from winter storms, more than offsetting the benefit of improved volume and mix. We anticipate both our Glendale and Pittston facilities to exit 2021 with four can manufacturing lines installed. And our Bowling Green ends manufacturing plant will pull forward at startup to the fourth quarter of 2021. Across the customer base, beverage can demand is strong across all brand categories, alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. We expect this favorable trend to continue and will support the additional EVA enhancing opportunities to align with long duration contracts. As we have discussed on prior calls, given three plants coming online in North America full year startup costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million. The impacts of these costs will be weighted more than the first half. In EMEA, segment volume for the first quarter was up 5% and specialty mix was 54% across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. We foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits throughout 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories, utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. In South America, first quarter volumes were up 14% and specialty mix increased to nearly 68%, despite only 80% to 85% of delivery channels being opened during the recent resurgence of the virus. We continue to see more upside in South America and the Frutal, Brazil plant, as well as other projects are progressing very well. We are also anticipating further investments, both in Brazil and throughout the region.  Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid to high teens and can mix on the shelf returning to even higher levels beyond 2020 once we have more capacity online. In summary, our global beverage team did an amazing job navigating some uncontrollable during the quarter, while also executing at a high level on the things we can control. Sticking with aluminum packaging, our aluminum aerosol team did a stellar job managing costs and preparing for reopenings, lifting, deodorant and personal care demand. Both earnings and volume increased slightly in the quarter. And the team continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottles to deliver innovation across multiple brand categories. Our cups team continue to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. In addition to the retail launch, John mentioned, the team recently kicked off the party starts here marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers, preparing for summer build with infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We will continue to invest marketing dollars behind the cups, retail launch in 2021, and expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. Turning to aerospace. The team continued to win contracts during the quarter, including building the spacecraft for NASA's heliophysics GLIDE mission, which will study earth exosphere, which is where Earth's atmosphere touches space. The GLIDE spacecraft and NOAA's space weather follow on spacecraft, also being built by Ball and we'll study solar winds and forecast solar weather we'll launch together in the future. The aerospace business also dealt with transitory costs due to a first quarter subcontractor rate adjustment associated with the national defense contract and inefficiencies brought about by the current COVID environment. This rate adjustment does not impede the near or long-term growth prospects for the business. I'm happy to address any of those questions during Q&A. Our team also executed on new infrastructure, completed critical testing on multiple instruments, one new study programs and backlog remain solid. We continue to be very excited about the business and appreciate all of the amazing work being done by the aerospace team. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable first quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share was $0.72 versus $0.61 in 2020, an increase of 18%. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage results, favorable FX, lower interest expense, and a lower effective tax rate offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate, labor, and startup costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 18%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $90 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after tax hurdle rate will follow through as new growth capital projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and as fellow owners and in alignment with our EVA discipline will proudly balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the first quarter strength and approaching our net leverage target range as we progress through 2021, I see returning that value in a more meaningful way sooner, rather than later. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks Scott, and thanks Dan. In summary, our Drive for 10 vision serves us very well, whether it be broadening our geographic expansion, developing new customers, markets, and products, and doing so with a commitment to being close to our customers and with uncompromising integrity. Following our strong first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we're even better positioned to exceed our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15% and exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond. We will work together to do everything possible to work safely, execute on capital investments, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA, and value for our shareholders. And with that, France, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Adam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Adam Samuelson: I was hoping maybe a little bit more color on some of the capacity additions. I believe in the prepared remarks you alluded to a 12 billion unit incremental capacity ending 2021 versus 2020. I'm just trying to make sure we can think about the phasing properly of that in terms of how much it actually benefits 2021 volume growth versus how much has carryover and incremental growth in 2022. And you can just think, help us think about incremental capacity that you're looking at for how commuting by [ph] exiting 2022 into 2023, just from the phasing of the incremental projects that you're looking at?
Dan Fisher: Sure. maybe just to restate where we ended 2020, obviously sold out – sold 105 billion cans, exited 2020 with installing an additional 7 billion referenced in the script today that we plan on exiting 2021 with an additional 12 on top of that. So you're getting to, obviously that 19 billion range on top of the 105. And then we clearly are thinking about additional plan projects in the 2022. It's a little early for me to speculate on the speed and the rate with which we're adding in 2022. There's still an awful lot of challenges, as you can imagine in South America with COVID and in Central Europe with COVID. We've got line of sight, as I've indicated to add 25 billion off of a base in 2019 by 2023. We can still execute against that. It's just timing as it relates to what we've already put in place and what we're executing on that. I will continue to inform you as we get further along in the year and as we are able to get our engineers transported from location to location.
Adam Samuelson: Got it. That's really helpful. And then I can have a quick follow-up just on the quarter, some of the discrete items in terms of startup costs or winter storm impact, or some of the supply chain items in aerospace anyway, to specifically quantify those, and if we think about those not necessarily repeating in 2022?
Scott Morrison: Yes. The north – this is Scott. North and Central America businesses where we felt most of that. The store costs were 10 million plus and startup costs of about 12 million in the quarter. And then we spent an additional incremental, probably $4 million over what we were planning to spend in cups as we wrap up that national retail launch. And then the aerospace impact was probably in the range of $7 million in total.
Adam Samuelson: Perfect. That's really helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question is from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Kyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question or thanks for taking my question. After the Glendale and Pittston plants are up and running, do you envision still needed to kind of import cans into the U.S. and meet this kind of elevated demand that we're seeing?
John Hayes: I do for 2022, it looks like latest forecast, what we're seeing. There'll be a modicum of import cans still for our customers if they continue to – if demand profiles continue in line with our expectations nowhere near the size and the scale that we dealt with here over the last couple of years. But there was still be an oversold element heading into 2022, even with all the capacity that I indicated.
Kyle White: Got it. And then just going to Brazil and South America, you touched on it a little bit. EMEA seems healthy there despite only 80% to 85% of the retail channels being open. Are you seeing any impacts at all from the kind of rise in COVID cases down there, any impact on operations or volumes, and then maybe just touch on kind of your capacity situation there, understanding that you have the new plant coming on later this year, but just given the growth profile there. I imagine you're still be constrained even after that comes up.
Dan Fisher: Yes, we're running at, I mean, I'll answer the back half of those questions first. We're running at extraordinarily low inventory levels. Can penetration in the market for Q1 was actually lower than on average what it was all of last year and even the year before. And that's because there's just not enough cans. And so even with the capacity adds that I'm talking about in South America, we're going to be incredibly tight in that region for the foreseeable future. A lot of it is underpinned by returnable glass shifting into cans. So if you reference back to my comments in the script, we were definitely looking into a series of further investments across that region as long as the demand profiles and the contracts look right. We have not had a lot of disruption and I give our teams a tremendous amount of credit. This time a year ago was challenging in kind of the Amazon region. But since then we haven't lost much in terms of production. And we've had some – it's the stories are incredible, as you can imagine in terms of what's happening with extended families and loved ones. And that has been the mental aspect of our employee base has been probably more challenging and getting people physically to work in an healthy environment. Obviously, these things can change with new variants showing up, but it's been a pretty resilient bunch down there and we really haven't seen much of an impact and knock on wood. We'll continue to manage this incredibly effective moving forward.
Kyle White: Got it. Thank you. Good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: In North America, understanding that you're running full and sold out, we saw this massive consumer stockpiling in the U.S. in March, April last year, as we went into lock down, as you anniversary those comps, did you see any impact or any change in terms of customer behavior or mix or offsets from recovery, and on-premise, I'm just trying to understand how, a summer reopening in the U.S. this year impacts your North American business?
Dan Fisher: Yes, there's a lot to unwrap there. A lot of open-ended questions too, that we're trying to pay attention to if I just take the on-premise, off-premise. One thing that we've seen over the last 15 months is there's been a number of customers that have really leaned into the direct channel, the e-commerce channel that certainly benefited us. I don't think that's going to suddenly turn off. Folks are going to continue to everyone's dealing with comprehending flex schedules. So a couple of days more a week at home versus in the office that all benefits cans. So there's room for optimism, at least with our substrate that there's been a shift – a secular shift for the long-term. I think that's here – and I think that is here for the long term. I do think though in the month of April, it was kind of interesting because that was the month of a year-over-year comparables. And what we saw was overall liquid volume on the alcohol side was down a little bit and cans were actually up a smidge in that. Meaning, cans were taking share, and on the soft drink side or the non-alcoholic side, non-alcoholic liquid volume was up and the cans were up as well. So not by huge amounts, but people I think were expecting a big decline. And obviously when you look week-to-week, there's big swings. But if you look over the past month, so to speak, those are the kind of trends we've been seeing.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. And that's very helpful color. And then, you talked about COVID protocols hindering aerospace, I think in 4Q as well, has aerospace been impacted more by COVID and COVID protocols more than bev and aerosol, relative to your expectations, is that fair to say? And then, does that sort of temper growth expectations for aerospace over the next couple of quarters? Or maybe things are easing just any additional detail you can give there?
Dan Fisher: Sure. I can give you a little color here. I think moving forward, I think we're in a far better place than can that we've experienced the last six to nine months. Keep in mind that historically and the type of work we do, much of it being classified. Folks need to be onsite in order to do the work. And so our aerospace business of roughly 5,000 employees today, you would see 80% of those folks would be onsite. And if you go back to the end of the Q3, beginning of Q4, it was more in the 35% to 40% range. We've begun to transition now. In the last couple of weeks, we've seen north of 60% onsite and that's continuing to build as folks get vaccinated and CDC guidelines are allowing us to bring more folks. And have so we should see productivity benefits not just for us, but the entire supply chain, which has been disrupted because of this. So we're feeling bullish about this quarter and the back half of the year and returning to some sense of normalcy for that business and increasing productivity and efficiency. So now hopefully that gives you some additional color on kind of what we've been up against.
Anthony Pettinari: No. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Maybe then just following up on the earlier questions, with the Texas weather disruption from February, and you're running quite lean on inventories to begin with just given the nature of the growth in the U.S. over the past few quarters, how you've kind of managed to flex your production as you gear up for the summer season from an inventory standpoint in the U.S.?
Dan Fisher: Yes, you're hitting on a great point and something that we're going to candidly have to figure out and grind through. There's – we're in peak season. We've been oversold for two years. We're at historically low inventory levels. We have an incredibly tight supply chain. Our teams are doing things and trying things and trying to be as transparent as we possibly can with customers. The one thing we can do is try to lock in candidly, a production plan for the balance of the year and try to stick with it as best we can that gives our plants the best chance of success, any alterations, any changes to that are going to put us in a very close to a – make the order environment, which it will be challenging. I think our teams are up for it. We do have capacity coming online, which I've commented on. Those are coming online, right in line with our expectations that will give us some modicum of relief. But yes, our customers are gearing up for a big peak season. They're taking every can we can possibly get. There's a lot of importation happening right now. And it's just going to be tight for the summer. The first quarter did not set us up for the most optimal scenario heading into the second quarter in North America.
Ghansham Panjabi: For sure. And then, almost every inflation cycle over the years, the beverage can industry has found some level of weakness in their contracts, whether it's freight pass-through or aluminum premiums or whatever else there was just given the nature of this particular inflation cycle, just how ferocious things have been in terms of cost increases, and maybe even wages at this point. How are your contracts holding up? And is there any risk in terms of incremental margins that we should be thinking about as we progress in the next few quarters specific to the ferocity, the inflation curve right now?
Dan Fisher: The contracts are, if you look three years ago to today, we've commented on it several times. You've been following us for a while, but they're much better. We're in a much better space. The downside is the downside that's always been in our business and it's the self-induced inefficiencies in our distribution channels. So where we – the more touch points we have in the supply chain that's not embedded in the cost to serve and the cost to deliver to our customers. Those are past three elements. It's a minimal amount, but as you said, the amount of inflation that we're experiencing, especially on freight there could be some dollars tied up in there that are tied to pass through.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: First question, just on the growth investment, I think you move forward the expected timing of the ends [ph] plant in North America this quarter, and it seems like broadly your growth projects are coming at a larger accelerated clip versus maybe what you laid out for us six months ago at your Investor Day. So I'm just curious what you'd attribute that to, whether it's greater customer demand, better project, win rate, better execution, maybe it's all the above, but just trying to get a sense of what's driving the real acceleration and growth investment there.
Scott Morrison: Well, I think all, all of the above really. I mean, the customer demand is not waning in any way. In fact, it continues to firm up. I think our execution has gotten better. I think, you look at North America, the wrap-up of these two new facilities has been better than expected. So I think we're getting better at all of that. And the opportunities, frankly, if we can pull them forward and get these things running faster we'll like it better.
John Hayes: Yes, just a case in point on that is talk about that the new hires we've had over the last 18 months or so. We probably in the beverage can business, I'll put aerospace aside. We probably hired over 3,000 people that is unprecedented in our business relative to what we have done in the past. We've talked a lot about these “startup costs.” It's really training costs at the end of the day. If you recall, three, four or five years ago, as a lessons learned where some of the footfalls we had in terms of our startups is we didn't bring people on early enough, and we didn't give them a chance to succeed from day one. We've been accelerating the hiring and training and development of those people six months prior to what we would have done a couple of years ago. And I think to Scott's point, we've been executing quite well as we're starting up these plants. And I think we're giving them a better shot at success.
Dan Fisher: Maybe one additional comment I did indicate that the end plant in Bowling Green, we were thinking, earmarking a Q1 startup. What we're talking about is three, four weeks earlier that it falls into the Q4. Scott hasn't come off and we haven't come up or startup costs. There's negligible change, or our capital spend for the year. So this is really, we've already had those costs and the capital outlays embedded. This is just recognition that the teams are executing. They're executing a little better than we anticipated, moves inside the fiscal year. And hopefully that that means candidly fewer imports on ends heading into next year.
Mike Leithead: Great. That's really helpful color. And then your second question, when you talk about Glendale and the Pittston facilities, I think you've highlighted that they're both going to have four operational lines by the end of this year, which – by the end of next year, which is already quite large. But you also noted that they are able to add incremental capacity from there. So I guess, could you maybe just touch on how much further you're able to scale these facilities is another one line, two lines, and just given the way you've structured these facilities. Would the incremental line costs be relatively similar or better versus, I don't know, say a Ball plant five years ago where you might've added a second or third line? Thanks.
John Hayes: Yes, I would look at it in terms of incremental output on kind of a mega line concept. So you would get additional capacity on the existing infrastructure, but we can scale the lines and within the footprint. And so we can do it much faster and much cheaper than had we taken a historical approach to it.
Operator: Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we could maybe put a finer point on the EBITDA progression or EBIT, however, you want to look at it. But a couple of years ago you had called out $2 billion of EBITDA on an annual basis. You're now at 475 in Q1, admittedly that had some startup costs in there and some storm impacts. So as you progress forward, could you potentially lay out some mile markers of, you have a lot of capacity growth coming, so would you be exiting kind of 2021 at a much higher rates than that, 475. And if so, I guess would most of the growth becoming in North America and South America, or how should we think about kind of the EBITDA progression from here? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: Yes, I think, well, on the first half of the year, we'll have – we have more startup costs than what we had last year, obviously. And then we'll start to get the benefit of that in the third quarter, we'll exit in the fourth quarter with much more strength. So I think it's more backend weighted. I think the performance in South America and Europe in particular continue to be very strong throughout the rest of the year. I mean, they've really surprised to the upside. And I think North America will be in the first half year, again, more heavily with startup costs and then start to accelerate in the back half of the year. 
John Hayes: Yes. And let's not forget also the first quarters are seasonally slowest quarter too.
Arun Viswanathan: Right. And as a follow-up then for aerospace also given, some COVID impact. I imagine that would also be better, as you moved through the learning curve with some of those new employees as well and your projects actually start to come online. So are you still thinking about kind of 15% EBIT growth in aerospace on an annualized basis?
Scott Morrison: Yes, I think that what we experienced in the first quarter, hopefully doesn't repeat as we go forward to Dan's comment about having more people onsite, the supply chain, getting better, COVID issues reducing that should accelerate their improvement in as we move through the rest of the year.
John Hayes: And when we initiated those – the $2 billion EBITDA number, we also weren't contemplating a cups business, which clearly we're forward investing in right now. So that should give us a whole another revenue stream moving forward.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
George Staphos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Hope you're doing well. Thanks for the details. 
John Hayes: Good morning.
George Staphos: I wanted to dig a little bit into Europe. The volume growth for the quarter was certainly in line with what you had guided to in the fourth quarter, but it was sequentially down from the fourth quarter, which you had said it was going to be a – was a stronger than expected quarter. Was there anything, as you looked under the hood in terms of the European trends in 1Q that were surprising perhaps a little bit less pass than expected, it doesn't seem like a given the margin trend, but just want to have more color on your on what we saw on 1Q and what it means for the rest of the year relative to 4Q?
Dan Fisher: George. I don't, it was in line with our expectations may be a little better that, that is an area where we are adding capacity. And we were allocating every single customer. So I wouldn't read too much in the growth rates right now in the year-on-year comparables. I mean, we're converting our France steel to aluminum facility. We're continuing to add capacity in multiple locations in Europe and the demand trends if we had cans and could serve them, we would have exceeded, I think fairly significantly these growth rates.
George Staphos: All right. Thanks for that again. Appreciate that commentary. Second question I had is around innovation. So we've talked a lot about this, all of us on these calls going back a number of years, and it's been great to see alcohol, the alcoholic category pickup with spike seltzers over the last couple of years. Can you give us an update on kind of the bleeding edge? And the next categories again, to the extent that you can comment on mix cocktails, things like that, and how sizable, how significant they might or might not be in a relative spike seltzers and some of the other products we've seen really drive your growth the last couple of years.
Dan Fisher: That is the million dollar question. That's a great question, George. I can tell you there are more innovations that are being pent up right now. That we unfortunately can't help our customers launch. And it's – it would be difficult to prognosticate. I think our customers over the last three to four years in North America in particular have really learned to develop products that the end consumer wants, they're pricing it, they're putting it in cans. What's going to win, I can tell you it's probably – it's probably got some alcohol in it and if it doesn't have alcohol in its low calorie, it's a different stimulant on waters. And I still think there's still an underpinning for still water. That's just an area where I still – and bullish on, it gives the retailers an opportunity to improve their CO2 footprint within their retail shelves and without having cans or allowing folks to step into those cans. That feels like a market that could be sizable in the future.
John Hayes: Hey, George, this is John. I may just add two things and amplify what Dan said. Number one, don't forget over the last 12 months. Innovation has really been on the sidelines particularly because the retail side of it they were just trying to fill up their stores with the basic needs. And so there was a lot of innovation that's pent up right now and to Dan's point, we're seeing it. The other thing is it gets to this real circularity that we talked about in our prepared remarks. It's real, it's here, there is a number of various anti-plastic at the state level laws that are either being enacted or being debated right now at a level that historically we haven't seen. And so, I think, that momentum continues. And I think there is increasingly by the consumer into a degree, our customers, a recognition that when you have the aluminum beverage can, which is the most sustainable package in the world, that there is an alternative to this. And as people are trying to reach their 2030 CO2 reduction goals, and sometimes even 2025, let alone net neutrality by 2040 or 2050, this is going to play an important role. And so, this isn't measured quarter-over-quarter, but it is a long-term secular thing that we continue to see playing out that benefits the aluminum beverage cans.
Dan Fisher: Yes, that's a great point. George, on that, it's like our biggest growth category is plastic. That's our biggest category.
George Staphos: Okay. Appreciating that, and I don't want to take up too much time. Is there a way for us to maybe think about the capacity that you are adding this year or through 2023? And how much of that you think is going to new categories? And then Scott, it sounds like the value return is perhaps more likely to happen sooner than later versus your prior expectations given what I heard you say on the call, could you give us, I mean, I know you're not going to time price a month or whatever, but can you tell us what is actually behind those comments? And what opportunity and flexibility you have to do more value return as the year progresses? Thanks guys. Good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher : Thanks. I'll answer the first question. I would say 80% to 90% of what we're putting in place is simply existing categories. We're earmarking some additional capacity, so our customers can step into some of these innovations and trial them, but the fact of the matter is we're just – we're so darn oversold, I think, it's just stepping into the existing categories in the space, the shift to cans. So unfortunately, not a lot of room to disrupt ourselves. So that's why we're so bullish on the medium- to long-term in this area.
Scott Morrison: And on the return of value to shareholders, George, we performed better in the first quarter than our expectations. So, we think that momentum continues looking through the remainder of the year. So, as we sit here today, we think we can accelerate, bring forward the return of value to shareholders while still investing a $1.5 billion of capital. So, I would target kind of buybacks in the $0.5 billion range for the remainder of the year, for this year. And then I think it accelerates into next year.
George Staphos: Thank you very much. 
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Silke Kueck with the JPMorgan, please go ahead.
Silke Kueck: Hi, good morning. How are you?
Scott Morrison: Good, thanks.
Silke Kueck: I have a question regarding your U.S. American can business. So, you said that the business in the quarter grew about like 6% in terms of volumes and some of your competitors thought the volumes North America grew 12% and another competitor said may be 8%. And so, I was wondering whether you had a view what was American beverage can growth really was for the industry in the first quarter? And if you had a view as to how the beer category grew versus soft drinks?
Scott Morrison: Yes, I mean, we're 45% of the U.S. market. So, you can probably take our growth rate and take the others and divide back to you, I'd say it's north of 6%, it's probably in the 8% to 9% range. And keep in mind for us, it would have been more. We had one significant customer who had a disruption in the quarter pretty significant from a volume perspective. And so, beer was approaching 1% growth. Our beer volume was down 8%. So, if we were more in line with flat to slight growth on our major beer customer, you would have seen double digit growth in the first quarter. I think there was an anomaly built in there. And I'm excluding the winter storm altogether. And even with that let's not forget we were short cans for the market. We could be selling more than we have. And so right now it's capacity constraint. And that's why we're so focused on getting this new capacity up and running.
Dan Fisher: But I'd be careful quarter-to-quarter volume growth because it depends on who is bringing on capacity at what particular time. So, you can kind of get distorted in a quarter.
Silke Kueck: That's helpful. And my follow-up, again on the North American business, if I look at your capacity which are like 50 billion cans plus, or minus. What is like the normal rate of like the bottlenecking or efficiency you can achieve, is it like 2%? Can we get like a billion cans out of the existing production every year?
Scott Morrison: Yes, it's a good question. Combination of how many additional conversions, how many additional label changes, et cetera. We're trying to earmark something in that kind of one to three productivity improvements. But when you look at the level of complexity as an end consumer, that's showing up the number of new products, the number of new labels, the number of new cans sizes, all of that meets against the productivity. So, if you can fundamentally stay flat, you are doing pretty darn good. You just need to be able to make sure you can charge for that.
Silke Kueck: I see. Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Salvator Tiano with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Salvator Tiano: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So first of all, you just mentioned that a major customer that since it was a pretty significant impact on your volumes in Q1. And I think what they've said is they expect to pretty much make up the entire production loss in the balance of the year. So hardly thinking about any tailwinds from recovering this loss in Q2 or later?
Scott Morrison: Yes, I don't know that there are tailwinds because we're oversold. And every single can – even in the first quarter, every single cam we could make, we can sell. I was just talking about the categories and the shift relative to that. So, the winter storm had an impact. I don't know how you can recover. The only way we could step up volume versus what we've characterized here is have our new facilities and new investments come online faster, add more efficient rates than we've seen historically. We've got a pretty impressive startup curve. That's already built-in place that's in here, but I wouldn't underestimate our people to do better. But at this point in the year, it's premature to characterize that there's a lot more on the table that we could see recovery in the back half of the year versus what we gave up in the first.
Salvator Tiano: Okay, great. [Indiscernible] just, the operating leverage in Europe and South America, your earnings growth was pretty good, especially in Europe, relative to the volume expansion, you saw 5%. So did you see any other specific tailwinds that would help boost your incremental margins? And how should we think about your incremental margins, absent start-up goals going forward?
Scott Morrison: Now we've historically said, whatever we grow on the top line, we should double that in terms of a percentage growth on the operating earnings line, exclude startup costs and some of the inefficiencies with the storm. I think we're more or less there across the Board globally. The things that can impact and influence it are hopefully what we're continuing to see is strengthening of the contracts. Supply demand tightness allows you to improve your terms and conditions. That gives us a better chance for success in our plants. And there's just a more predictable nature to that flow through moving forward, I believe, as we get capacity put online. Yes. And also mix plays an important part of that as well.
Salvator Tiano: Okay, perfect. So, I guess the recent opportunity for some quarters, or even a couple of years to be above normalized two times earnings growth over top line growth.
John Hayes: There's an opportunity nothing's linear, as you indicated is the preface there.
Salvator Tiano: Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead
Mark Wilde: Hi. Good morning, Dan, John, Scott.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: I wonder Dan, can you just give us some sense about the impact of these kind of global freight and logistics issues on both the flow of can sheet, but also just how it's affecting your ability to ship cans around markets this year?
Dan Fisher: Yes, the challenge is any – we're extraordinarily tight. So, we haven't seen much of what you're describing, but there is always the potential as we continue to grow, as we have tightness in these domestic markets, as the supply chains in every industry are getting extended. The challenge will be if we had to dip into-non domestic aluminum, if we had to dip into China, where the overwhelming majority of excess metal is in the world, we know those freight costs are much higher than they were a year ago, 18 months ago, two years ago. And the real risk though is probably more our ability to potentially pass through that cost. It's just getting it hung up in the ports right now. So, I would see the risk being more on being able to fill demand profiles if we had to go that route, then not being able to potentially pass through the inflationary pressures on the delivered metal. But that's an area that we're paying attention to.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then just in terms of your own shipping around of cans this year and bringing them into North America in particular.
Dan Fisher: Yes, it, it's got more to do with the consistency of the delivery and the predictability of when we can get those LTL carriers. Our team has done a really nice job of managing it, but anything that we have to do that’s spot price related, that doesn't fall within the bounds of contracts that we previously negotiated. Those are accelerated and those at times can be challenge for us to pass those through.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Dan, just for my follow-on, you mentioned contracts and terms and in your commentary. And I wonder, particularly with regard to Europe, if you can just perhaps put a little more color around that.
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think, we indicated this briefly in our Q1 comments. Europe, if you look back over the last three years, North America and South America have felt the supply constraints and the tightness faster with much more conviction, if you will. And so that has enabled a very different seat at the table, if you will, of negotiations. The first quarter and the tail and a Q4 in Europe have shown up in a very similar way. And so, I would say moving forward, Europe if you look at our gross profit or contribution margin, it's as good as anywhere in the world. So I wouldn't indicate there's a whole lot to be gained there, but in terms of terms and conditions maybe longer-term contractual opportunities, those things I could see those moving in a different way than what we've experienced historically and stepping into this moving forward if the market continues to be as tight as it is.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gabe Hajde: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two maybe quick ones. Dan, you mentioned importing into the U.S. until this end modules in Kentucky. And I'm kind of piggybacking off the sales question in terms of contribution down in South America. I mean, by my calculations the 14% volume growth gets you 12 to 15 million of incremental contribution. So, I'm curious if it was the ends that you're producing down there and maybe bringing them into the U.S. that will help aid that? I guess that's question number one. And then when that goes away, perhaps the profitability stays down there as you ramp up this capacity, there and you sell the [indiscernible] as opposed to into the U.S.
Dan Fisher: Yes, that's a good question. There's a bit of that happening. Yes, we're shipping some ends. It's not going to be material to those results. It was just a damn good quarter in South America, good mix, good volume. There was a modicum of shipments up from South America into North America on ends, and we're doing a little bit out of Europe. And to your point as that will require less capital investment in the aggregate package moving forward as we free up that capacity back into those regions. So, it should be as you indicated, a win-win-win for multiple regions as it relates to standing up bowl in green [ph].
Gabe Hajde: Okay. And I think in the press release, you guys mentioned favorable price mix down in South America. I thought the specialty mix as a portion of cans was pretty high already. So, I'm kind of interpreting that as maybe a little a price comment. I expect that would persist through the balance of the year. I guess, can you confirm that? And then kind of a secondary question, I read an interesting article talking about Canadian craft brewers, importing cans from places like South Korea and even China. It strikes me number one, kind of interesting from a logistics standpoint; and number two, how do you guys strike a balance from a commercial standpoint with not enticing unwanted capacity or investment versus obviously, getting paid for what you guys have talked about in terms of complexity and stuff like that?
John Hayes: Yes, I think, the first part of your question, I think, about it more in terms of customer mix, favorable customer mix, as opposed to – you draw such a fine line, we talk about price and customer mix almost simultaneously. We can add a bunch of accountants to segment that stuff out, but the reality is you got on average higher price for the same product family, and it can be driven simply by customer mix. And the second question was about the kind of small Canadian brewers. This is a very delicate balance because Dan has said repeatedly, we're oversold, number one. Number two, we have long-term contractual commitments to the larger customers. And so, some of this innovation that typically comes from these smaller, I don't want to call them startups, those smaller regional customers, typically they are the more of the list price type of customer that Dan was referring to in the prepared remarks. And when you don't have capacity they're looking somewhere to get them. And so, you are right, that the supply chain complexity of bringing cans in from across the world is intense, not only from a cost perspective, but just a complexity of the supply chain perspective. This is why, again, we're trying to get our capacity ramped up as quickly as we can because, I think, it's going to open the door in terms of innovation by not only the large customers, but the small customers as well. And there's a number of small customers that we're in contact with that they put new can lines in, but they didn't really order ahead in terms of cans. And so we're trying to help them out as best we can, given the constraints that we have in our system right now.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you, guys for the detail. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jake Bleicher with Carson Wealth. Please go ahead.
Jake Bleicher: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the time. I was wondering on the previous call, you talked about some of the innovation that we had seen over the last couple of years in North America, starting to spread to Europe. And I was wondering if you could give us any update on that as far as the innovation you are seeing over there? And also is any of that spreading to South America, or is that still a conversion from glass to aluminum phenomenon?
Scott Morrison: Yes, good question. I think we were talking specifically about the seltzer movement. There were countless questions on that. Well we see that in other parts of the world. By everything we're seeing and hearing it will show up in Europe, in Western Europe first. I know capacity is being added. I'll go back to my comments that everyone is on allocation over there, we're oversold. So, I think, innovations are – it will be a longer supply chain and a longer pipeline for those to show up in a meaningful way. But they are out, they are in the market, specifically in the UK. In South America we are seeing innovation. I don't think you can underestimate within beer, the beer category, there has been a huge shift into different ingredients, craft beer, hops from Europe, all of that has been transitory in the last three to four years and it has now changed the landscape altogether. Those disruptors in the marketplace that started there all came out in cans. And that was really the tipping point for the incumbents that had returnable glass to kind of wake up to the fact that we probably need to match what's happening because we're losing share. And so, your comment is right, it is returnable glass, but the returnable glass shift, I could probably characterize it, it came as a result of innovation and innovation in the cans. And we see that there's still plenty of room for that to grow. I think I indicated in my prepared remarks, only 51% can penetration in the first quarter. And that's down from north of 60% in the third quarter last year. And that's just a function of tight supply from cans in the marketplace.
John Hayes: France, we're past the top of the hour. We'll take one more question if there is one.
Operator: Okay. Our last question then will be from the line of still with Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. The last few quarters you've seen really strong performance out of Europe and that's during period when you are seasonally slower. So what's driving the strong results? And can you build on this in the coming quarters when you kind of factor in seasonality?
John Hayes: Yes, overwhelmingly it's been beer. I think some of the customers have had success. There is an underpinning, that's a heavy on-premise market. There may be some underpinnings that there's been a shift and a little fervor in moving to cans. But even as things start to open up over in Europe, we're still seeing that continued strength. We have got a heavy presence, as you know, in Russia. Russia continues to bear fruit. We have a heavy presence in the energy category, and that's doing well. And the UK has just been on fire. And it's a combination of anti-plastic sentiment there and additional fillers coming into the UK. And so, a number of those are factoring in, but we still believe in Europe, it's got the lowest can penetration of any major region in the world. It's really underserved. I think the folks that have been so heavily weighted to on-premise are starting to wake up to the fact that we need to divest our supply chain. And I think cans are going to do really well there for the foreseeable future. And I'll just finish up from a longer view. Since we acquired that business in 2016, our folks have done an amazing job on the cost side of the business. So, from a financial results perspective, I think, in addition to all the mix and other growth opportunities, Dan was just talking about from a cost perspective, I think, we're in such a better spot today than we were three, four, five years ago in that business.
Philip Ng: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess a competitor of yours called out higher inflation that could impact your margins, I think, particularly in North America and they called out coatings. Is that something we should be mindful of in having more of an impact on your profitability in the coming quarters?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I mean, inflation is absolutely something we're keeping our eye on it's happening in every industry, specific to that particular area. We have password mechanisms in place. We've got longstanding contracts. Based on what we're seeing and what we're hearing from our supply base right now it's not overly concerning. I think we can manage that. Scott is there anything you have to add on.
Scott Morrison: Yes, so just one thing on the margins, just be careful on margin percentage, because if you look at metal costs year-over-year, there's going to be huge variations. There was a 24% difference in the first quarter of this year versus last year higher. It will be even more dramatic than that in the second quarter. So, you are going to see weird things from a margin percentage standpoint, but to Dan's point, I think, we have good passthrough mechanism, but it shouldn't impact our earnings dollars.
Philip Ng: Got it. So just outside of the aluminum impact sounds like you are managing inflation pretty well. That's great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott Morrison: Okay. Well, thank you all. France, thanks for your guidance on the call. I appreciate everyone's input and we'll be speaking to you soon. See you all.
Operator: You are very welcome, sir. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and kindly ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 4, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, Dmitra, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release financials include description of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other nonreportable segments.  Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our new President; and Scott Morrison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks; Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends; Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company.  First, let me begin by thanking our employees. Together, we were able to adapt, work safely, serve our customers and hire thousands of new colleagues amidst unprecedented growth and external challenges. Your empathy, flexibility, adaptability and can-do spirit are remarkable. So thank you. I also want to thank our customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate as well. This past year has put a profound challenges on all of us and our ability to work with each of you for the betterment of all is not taken for granted by us. We're truly blessed as an organization and as a family of all employees to work with you all. And together, we have persevered.  2020 finished strong with full year comparable diluted earnings per share up 17%. Full year comparable net earnings up 14% and EVA dollars up 25%. Momentum continues across our businesses with full year and fourth quarter global beverage volumes up 5% and 12%, respectively, and won net book backlog in aerospace is up 30% year-over-year.  The growth trajectory in our packaging and aerospace businesses, our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and our execution on growth capital investments give us even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars and cash from operations. Together, these elements will enhance a significant return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond.  Our focus remains on working safely, executing on capital investments, leveraging our product portfolio and technologies, enhancing the customer experience and investing in talent, training, processes and systems to deliver long-term value.  Before I turn it over to Dan to discuss our business performance, we've had a variety of well-deserved promotions since our last earnings call, and I want to congratulate everyone, including but not limited to: Dan, Scott Morrison, Lisa Polly, Ron Lewis, Kerry Cozy, Dave Kaufman, Charles Johnson and Jay Billings on their well-deserved promotions as well as to Stan Platt on his upcoming retirement and many contributions to ball.  Our long-standing succession planning process is thorough and thoughtful. In 2020, our employee base is up over 3,500 people to serve the sizable amount of growth in front of us. With our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity happening as I speak, this is a perfect time to further engage our rising leaders while leveraging long-standing Ball mentors to support their success to create equal opportunities for each and every one of us at Ball.  Other highlights in 2020 include: our global beverage business has completed or is completing the start-up and speed up of numerous lines in the U.S., EMEA and Brazil as well as announcing additional projects to install at least 25 billion units of contracted capacity by the end of 2023. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully closed on the aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. Our cups team constructed and started up our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility in preparation for our expanded 2021 retail launch, which we expect shortly.  Our businesses have significantly increased employee training and development to ensure smooth startups of our various projects as well as hosted a variety of virtual programs to help our new folks get up to speed on who we are, where we're going and what's important, whether it be behaving like true owners to our EVA mindset or providing inclusivity programs to help foster immersion into the Ball culture. And we further drove our sustainability leadership to ensure that the aluminum packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world, whether it be publishing third-party reviewed life cycle analysis that independently verified aluminum packaging as the best substrate relative to its carbon footprint; finalized approval of our science-based targets that's in alignment with the 1.5-degree Celsius targets of the intergovernmental panel on climate change; implemented several renewable energy programs; achieved system-wide performance of GANA custody ASI certification in our EMEA business or launch plans to achieve ASI certification in our remaining regions.  In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength, and our future is getting even brighter. Despite the rise in global COVID-19 cases in the geographies where we operate, nothing is slowing us down in our businesses, and we are excited to bring additional capacity and infrastructure online as quickly and as safely as possible in 2021 and beyond.  To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan. Dan?
Daniel Fisher: Thanks, John. It is certainly humbling to step into my new role as President. This is a company that means a great deal to me and has for the last 11 years. In my estimation, the future of Ball has never been brighter, and I look forward to continuing that trajectory with our over 22,000 team members for years to come.  Transitioning to how we ended the year, I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We all became closer during 2020, a silver lining for sure. Our HR and environmental health and safety professionals and packaging and aerospace continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. And in certain regions outside of the U.S., our teams have facilitated access to additional health care services for our employees and their family members impacted by COVID-19. Thank you again. You are saving lives.  First, I'll spend some time discussing global beverage and then move on to our aerospace performance and outlook. In 2020, global beverage volumes were up 5% despite the difficult second quarter in South America and EMEA. Specialty mix increased to 46%, operating earnings were up 8%, and we increased EVA dollars 40%. We also secured new customer and supply chain contracts; refocused on customer experience with the new customer portal, The Source; began manufacturing the aluminum cup at scale; expanded our team to ensure our growth is properly resourced; elevated a diverse group of leaders across management, engineering, commercial and procurement. And as John mentioned, we made significant progress in commercializing sustainability. The team truly delivered amidst challenging circumstances.  As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and every day is leading to even more opportunities as consumers and customers continue to leverage sustainable aluminum packaging with their brands and product extensions. It is vital in 2021 that we effectively manage complexity, support a resilient and agile supply chain, deliver a great customer experience and through sustainability in our product portfolio, continue to broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. And though it is only February, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve these goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in aspiration we first discussed at our 2018 Investor Day.  By 2025, we continue to believe that the industry will go by at least 100 billion units, and Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units given our scale and capabilities in the world's largest can markets. By the end of 2023, we will have installed 25 billion units of capacity to support our customers' filling capacity expansions and product portfolio growth. Contractual terms and conditions are favorable. We have primed the supply chain by entering into multiyear contracts for equipment, next-gen coatings and metal supply. And of course, adhere to our EVA discipline in every facet of these preparations.  Now we execute. At present and despite 7 billion units plus of annual run rate capacity coming online, demand continues to outstrip supply across North America, South America and our EMEA business. Therefore, the timing and size of capacity additions coming online will influence quarterly year-over-year growth rates.  So let's not get distracted by any short-term data points. Simply put, this is a significant multiyear growth story from a highly cash-generative company that has an established proven growth rate with the wherewithal and flexibility to invest more and return a lot of value to fellow shareholders along the journey. We are thankful to be able to add skilled manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and elsewhere to help the global economy recover.  As we look forward, to minimize startup costs and provide our customers the best experience with Ball, execution will be key. I'm happy to report that our new lines in Fort Worth and Rome are running at speed, that our new Glendale, Arizona plant started up its initial line recently, and that incremental line -- lines have already been installed in Glendale to support our customers' successful filling operation startup located adjacent to our facility. Also in our new Pittston, Pennsylvania plant, preparations are being made to ramp up much needed capacity in the second half of 2021. In addition, we will be executing additional investments across our North American footprint, including construction of a new in-manufacturing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to align can and end availability. We anticipate the end facility coming online in 2022.  As we look out across our global plant network outside of the U.S., we announced this month our intention to open a new 2-line beverage can plant in the Czech Republic, and our new 2-line beverage can plant in Frutal, Brazil will supply additional cans to the fast-growing Brazilian can market in late 2021.  In North America beverage, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 11% and 6%, respectively. Specialty mix improved to 34%. Going forward, we see volume growth greater than 6% over the next 3 to 5 years and continued growth in specialty, all supported by longer duration contracts. In the fourth quarter, given the scale of new capacity coming online and labor to support them, start-up costs offset the benefit of improved volume and mix. In 2021, start-up costs will continue throughout the year, given the continued pace of growth and are expected to be North American-centric and in the range of 50 million, with volume growth supported by new capacity improved contractual terms and mix will more than be offsetting their impact.  We continue to prioritize growth opportunities in North America and look forward to discussing additional plans throughout 2021 and 2022. Despite the industry capacity coming online, we see the demand continuing to outstrip supply well into 2023. And depending on our customers' rate of capacity expansion, possibly beyond.  In EMEA, segment volume for the full year and fourth quarter was up 5% and 20%, respectively, and specialty mix increased to 54%. Across all EMEA business, demand trends improved throughout the year, and positive momentum has continued into 2021. Additional capital projects completed across the region provided needed capacity, and we foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits in 2021 and beyond.  Future growth will be supported by new categories utilizing cans and projects like the new Czech plant as well as other regional opportunities. Tight supply/demand continues, and we will assess all future opportunities through the lens of EVA.  In South America, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 12% and 11%, respectively, driven by increased package mix for aluminum cans in the beer category, resulting in our specialty mix growing to 62%. Following a difficult second quarter, beverage cans have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates and package mix on the shelf remains in the 60% range versus a rate of 50% at the end of first quarter 2020.  Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid to high teens and can mix on the shelf remaining high beyond 2020 and supported by investments like our new Frutal facility.  In summary, our global beverage team, now led by Ron Lewis, navigated a dynamic and challenging year through sheer will and controlling the things we can control. We also thank our teams in India, Saudi Arabia and global joint ventures for supporting our global regions and much-needed support during 2020 and beyond.  Sticking with global packaging. Our aluminum aerosol team did an amazing job during a challenging year. Earnings increased slightly despite a 3% decline in global volumes due to diminished use of deodorants and hair care products during global corn teams. The team pivoted to new categories, managed costs, integrated an acquisition and positioned our infinity refillable, reclosable sustainability solution for personal care lotions and shampoos, now in plastics. And as John mentioned, our cups team continued to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. Following the company's $20 million plus investment to stand up the business, we expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022.  Turning to aerospace. Full year and fourth quarter operating earnings improved 9% and 5%, respectively. Impressive results given a variety of inefficiencies brought about by operating the business during the current COVID environment, which I'm happy to address during Q&A. Rest assured, there is no change in our ability to grow. Our team persevered and has not lost any momentum, winning new work and bringing on new talent to support our growth. We also executed on new infrastructure, won new study contracts, upgraded tools and systems and increased our unfunded backlog, 30% year-over-year. We continue to be very excited about the long-term prospects of this business as well. And on a personal note, I look forward to leveraging Dave Kaufman's extensive industry knowledge as we both assume our new roles.  Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up and stay safe. It's going to be another amazing year. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. I'll focus my comments specifically on the fourth quarter and key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Comparable fourth quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.81 versus $0.71 in 2019, an increase of 14%. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage and aerospace segment results, a lower share count and lower interest expense, offset by higher corporate costs and start-up and labor costs, related to our new cups business and new U.S. beverage can facilities. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment.  Taking into account the dynamic growth in our businesses and the necessary speed to market for ongoing initiatives, we invested $1.1 billion in CapEx in 2020, while also returning $275 million to our shareholders. All in, an excellent year. The business and balance sheet are strong. EVA dollars are growing, and we're ready for the next stair-step in growth.  As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 19%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million, roughly flat with the past year. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable is expected to be in the range of $80 million as we support our larger and growing businesses.  Our 2021 cash from operations will continue to grow, in line with the earnings trajectory. And longer term, we see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. As we discussed at last year's Investor Day, we'll be investing even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity in North America, EMEA and South America, while also investing in our aluminum cups business. And currently expect 2021 CapEx to be in excess of $1.5 billion. Beyond 2021, multiyear internal investments to serve organic growth and that returns well above our 9% after-tax rate will continue.  Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities, with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our growing operating cash flow, we're managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively, and with the flexibility of returning even more value to our long-term shareholders in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In summary, our Drive for 10 vision served us very well over the past decade and indeed in 2020, whether it be broadening our geographic expansion, developing new customers, markets and products and doing so with a commitment to being close to our customers and with uncompromising integrity. Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth while delivering significant value to our shareholders as we embark upon our 141st year in operation.  As we sit here today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share greater than our long-term goal of 10% to 15% and achieve or exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond is certainly our expectation. Our teams working together will do everything possible to outperform, work safely and execute on capital investments. Our time is now, and we are thankful to look at 2021 as a year of promise and great opportunity. And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.
Neel Kumar: In North and Central America, we just adjust out the $25 million of start-up costs, margins and incremental sales are still a bit lower than what you've seen in prior quarters. Can you just provide some color on why the incremental margins were lighter this quarter? And then in general, can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the potential growth in North America earnings in 2021 based on the various moving pieces, like higher volumes, better contractual terms and higher start-up costs?
Scott Morrison: Sure. This is Scott. I'll take that. Yes. I mean, if you look at the $25 million of incremental cost, about half of that is start-up and about half of that is just increased labor to support the total growth in the business. If you look at it from that perspective -- and then also, remember, we were importing quite a few cans in the fourth quarter, and the margins on those incremental cans from a mix standpoint aren't going to be as good as what you would normally get. So as we ramp up this capacity, we'll need to do that less. And so margins will improve.  And the mix will improve over time, too, as most of the capacity we're putting in is specialty, so I would expect. And in 2021, we the profitability will grow. But remember, I think we mentioned that there's probably $50 million of start-up costs that we'll see in 2021 that will dampen those margins. You'll see most of that in the first half of the year as we ramp up these big facilities, Glendale and Pittston and start on Bowling Green as well. But I think long term, we're going to like these investments a lot because they've achieved much better than our 9% after-tax target.
Neel Kumar: Great. That's helpful. And then in Brazil, you talked about can shelf mix from an elevated at 60% versus 50% in the first quarter. Could you just give us a sense of like what one point of shelf mix in the cans means in terms of Brazilian demand? And you talked about achieving mid- to high-teens growth in the region, is that a Ball-specific comment or your general expectation of Brazilian demand?
Scott Morrison: Yes. Good question. I think it's where it's trending right now. It's general demand in the market. So I'll give you a little color and characterization of why this is happening. Obviously, there's a huge incumbent in Brazil that has historically leaned a little bit more into returnable glass. And a series of competitors have come in, and they've done really well with different offerings, principally in the beer space, all in cans. And I think they have, over the last 3 to 5 years, we've talked about and we've seen can penetration. I think the end consumer is kind of liking that. The grocery store and retail operators like that. They don't want to carry these returnable glass bottles. And so that influence has continued to grow, and I think the large incumbent is shifting as well to offer what the end consumer wants.  To characterize a -- I think what we were talking about back in our -- earlier this summer, when we were talking about or in 2020 when we had our shareholder day, Investor Day, we were characterizing growth. And we were thinking incremental lifts probably from the low 50s to the mid-50s in terms of can penetration. And so that delta versus a 60% to low 60, it could be 4 billion to 5 billion cans in the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are -- that number that we quoted today in our prepared comments, that was in the third quarter, I believe it was like in the high 60s. And so we're operating now in kind of what could be a more normalized run rate. But given COVID and everything that's going on, we'll have to see how that meters out over the next quarters and years. But we're still bullish on incremental advancement. And even at 60%, you referenced that versus North America where can penetration in the beer space is north of 70%. I think there's a real good opportunity to see that kind of get to 60, hover at 60, maybe even get to the upper ends there. But again, we'll have to follow that quarter-by-quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan: Congrats on the progress in '20. I just wanted to ask about CapEx and I guess, long-term growth. So you've guided to some increases here just given some of the recent announcements. Where do you see CapEx maybe in '23 and '24? Do you expect that to come down to maybe $1.1 billion? And what do you see as your long-term maintenance CapEx with all these new facilities?
Scott Morrison: Yes. Maintenance Capex, if you think about it per facility, I think a couple of million, $2 million, $3 million per facility, probably a year is a good number on the beverage side. We'll spend over $1.5 billion this year. We have a lot of opportunities and really nice EVA-generating returns. I think we could be at an elevated level in '23 as well. And then my crystal ball is not that great. But I would see it's starting to moderate some, but I think we're going to be at elevated levels here for at least the next couple of years.
John Hayes: Here's the beauty about our business. We have many levers to pull, and we can accelerate pull back depending on what happens in the market. We've looked at this over the last 25 years within our business and so what we see is an opportunity. And as we went into the COVID situation, we saw an opportunity to accelerate and that's exactly what we did. If -- as you look out '23, '24, '25, and we see an opportunity to accelerate or decelerate that, we've got plenty of levers to pull. And so when you think about, historically, our maintenance CapEx had been in the range of t $275 million, $300 million. It's creeping up, but it's not $500 million. And so we have a lot of growth capital and anticipate going forward, but we can always dial it back if the market dictates.
Scott Morrison: That's a good point. And what I would also add is that we spent probably $250 million more this -- in 2020 than we had initially thought. And I look at that as really good because the faster we can get these assets up, the faster we can make cans and sell them at really nice margins.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And then also just wanted to ask real quickly on some of your markets outside of the U.S., have you seen any emerging trends that we've seen in the U.S. develop elsewhere, like seltzers or anything else in any category growth that you're excited about?
Daniel Fisher: No, that's a great question. I do think that you will see -- it will be interesting to see how seltzer plays in Europe, but there's clearly -- there's some underlying thinking that -- you're starting to see it show up in the U.K. that's a heavy can market there. Where it translates into other parts of that region, it will be interesting to see how that manifests. And I think you'll see it in South America as well. And then it's just to what degree is it successful, we'll have to wait and see with the scanning data.
John Hayes: Yes. In addition to the new categories that Dan was just talking about, let's not forget about sustainability where can penetration is Europe is probably the lowest of any region around the world, certainly any major region around the world. And I talked in my prepared remarks about life cycle analysis and others. And you're going to see Ball Corporation put its shoulder really into getting the word out not only to customers and our -- the consumers but also to NGOs and government officials because it indeed is the most sustainable package out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Michael Leithead: I guess first, I want to follow-up on one of the answers around imported cans in North America. I guess, first, could you maybe just give us a sense of how many cans you ended up importing this year? And second, if I heard you right, as you start to kind of, over the next couple of years, replace imported cans with domestically manufactured cans. Is it fair to say that, that should give you some sort of margin uplift just on a mix benefit there?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I'll answer the second question first. And you referenced Scott's comment earlier, yes, it will. And so a couple of things are happening. I'd say -- I can give you kind of fourth quarter, we were in the $400 million to $500 million can range Ball specifically about what was imported. And keep in mind, we're working with customers that we want to work with for decades here. So they're going to pay an exorbitant freight rate and things of that nature. We're working with our third-party JVs, et cetera. So we're trying to make this as comfortable as possible for them to get those cans on the shelf to continue to build the momentum with the can. So as Scott said, as this capacity comes online over the next couple of years, really we should see that kind of normalize, and you'll get back to a typical fall through 2x of volume growth on the leverage side.
Michael Leithead: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could ask one on the CapEx outlook from a different angle. I think you mentioned this year, you're doing a -- this year, you're doing a record $1.5 billion, which is call it, 2.5x the amount of CapEx you spent in 2019 and you referenced thousands of new hires. Can you maybe just talk about your ability to logistically manage all that? Have you needed to change any of your procedures or processes to just improve the bandwidth of managing all of these different processes efficiently?
Daniel Fisher: Yes, absolutely, full stop. And we've kind of -- we've been at this for 2 or 3 years, I would say, kind of when we started to lean in when we really started to see those -- we've referenced it several times, the new product introductions in North America as kind of a defining KPI for us relative to the big CPG companies leaning heavier into cans, the sustainability tailwinds that we're seeing. So I referenced it in my opening remarks. We've gone longer in terms of establishing supply agreements to make sure that capacity is there in the supply chain. We've also looked at some of the -- where we've stubbed our toes candidly, historically in new plant start-ups, and a lot of that had to do with -- we didn't hire far enough advance. We didn't train folks. We didn't plan for elements of attrition. So we started hiring more engineers. We started hiring a lot more folks in talent acquisition and training capabilities. We've made a lot of investments there. So you're right. These are big investments, big plants. And I think we've changed how we've operated or thought about operating and starting up facilities. And hopefully, you'll see that in the improved benefits on our start-up curves.
John Hayes: And I think as it relates to capital spending that much more than we used to spend, we -- to Dan's point, on adding engineers, we've beefed up our capabilities to be able to do this. I mean you have to think differently as a growth company than we were 5, 6 years ago when we were growing. And so we've been investing in that over the past couple of years to reap these benefits. And so I think we're doing a much better job now than we were 1 year ago or 2 years ago in all of this.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng: With the capacity you're going to bring on this year in North America and perhaps maybe you're building a little more inventory, if you can, do you feel good about meeting all demand this year in North America? Since last year, you kind of had to walk away from some business.
Daniel Fisher: Great question. I would -- so the building inventory, that's a bit of a dream scenario right now. We're not anywhere near that. And we might not be for next couple of years. We're going to be living hand-to-mouth, and we're heavily reliant on standing up capacity to meet our customer requirements. We will be servicing the excess demand similar to kind of how it showed up in the fourth quarter. We'll be we can find cans anywhere in our network around the world, we will be shipping in to make sure that our customers can lean into their new product launches and other things that will help grow the can long term. And again, this is, in my prepared remarks, I really leaned into this is not a quarter-to-quarter way we're looking at this. This is multiyear, significant growth, and we want to make sure that we give our customers what they need, when they need it right now to continue to lean into the can and continue to grow the can.
John Hayes: Yes. And Phil, that's one of the reasons why we spent more in even 2020 than we were anticipated, and that's why the it's even that much more elevated in 2021 because as we sit here right now, to Dan's point, we are scrambling to service our customers. And we don't see that changing, and that's why we're putting our foot to the pedal to make sure that we're not leaving our customers short.
Philip Ng: Got it. That's a really exciting backdrop to be in. You gave some color on start-up costs being about $50 million. Where did it kind of settle out in 2020? And then obviously, we're seeing a little more inflation across the board. Want to get some comfort and color on your ability to kind of manage that and how you're set up from a pass-through standpoint. I know '18 was a little tougher, but I think your contract is a little more favorable in terms of managing freight and stuff of that nature. So can you kind of unpack that -- those 2 components?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. The start-up was about half that in 2020, but then you have an increased labor base, too. Remember, our business is growing, not just with the start-ups, but we're backfilling a lot of jobs. So we're adding to the labor base. So year-over-year in the fourth quarter, that was up $13 million, $14 million. So we're getting -- trying to keep up and being prepared for us to be able to handle all this growth. And I think relative to inflation, yes, I think we're in a much better space than we were kind of at the initializing the Rexam acquisition in terms of what we've been building in terms of our contracts, terms and conditions. So yes, we're keenly aware of what's happening in the world relative to freight rates. And I think we're pretty well protected kind of across the board.
Philip Ng: Okay. Super helpful. And just one last quick one for me. The $40 billion of growth that you've kind of mentioned through 2025, and you reiterated that today. How much of that secured contractually? And then any color on the shape of the ramp of the next few years?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I would say I've got a better line of sight into probably 2023. We just finished our strategic planning process here, and we've taken it out. And overwhelmingly, we're contracted on that $25 billion through 2023. So when that capacity comes online, it will be backstopped by, I can say, 80%, 85% is contracted. And that's the right we're at right now from a demand standpoint. The other 15, I might have -- might not have it inked, but there's plenty of folks that are willing to take that capacity.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I wanted to go back to the CapEx question from earlier. At the Analyst Day, which was just four months ago, you highlighted $5-plus billion of cumulative CapEx between 2020 and 2025. And so I'm just curious, is the uptick in 2021, at this point, reflective of just timing relative to the 5-plus billion number? Or should we expect total CapEx through '25 to be well above that? And then related -- you also put it towards $700 million of incremental EBIT through 2023. Is that still the right number to look at? Or should we -- would it be higher, given the acceleration in 2021 Capex?
Scott Morrison: No. On the Capex, I think a lot of it is just, to Dan's point, it's solidifying those contractual relationships with our customers that solidify our belief that the volume is going to be there. And so it's putting capacity in to meet those needs. So I wouldn't say it's dramatically different other than things are pulling forward probably from where we were before.
Ghansham Panjabi: And for $700 million of EBIT?
Scott Morrison: So yes, that still should be a good number. Because remember, when you start-up a plant, you're not going to get -- you have a ramp-up curve. And so it's going to take some time for that ramp-up curve to execute on and get to kind of a full run rate. And so when you put something in the ground today, especially with the new plant. If you're adding an incremental line, you get there a lot faster, obviously, like Fort Worth and Rome where we added lines last year, you move up that ramp-up curve much quicker. When you're doing something new, where you got a new workforce that hasn't made cans before. It's going to take a little bit more time to kind of get the real -- the top returns out of those out of those investments. So things that will start in 2021, get better in 2022 and '23. And so there's kind of a compounding effect as you move forward out beyond '23 to for all this capital.
John Hayes: Ghansham, this is John. Let me answer your question a different way. And the question is, what has changed since the Investor Day? Nothing has changed other than we have greater conviction than what we talked about 4 months ago. And so what you're seeing is an acceleration of capital to take advantage of that. And to Dan's point is I wish I could tell you what 2024, it looks like, I can't. It's too far out there. But these trends are the strongest I've seen in my 20-plus years at Ball Corporation by far.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks for clarifying that. And then I just want to ask a different question. I mean...
John Hayes: I think we lost you.
Daniel Fisher: Operator, maybe we should go to the next question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Can you hear me now?
John Hayes: Yes, we can hear you now.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hello? I guess I was asking about the --
Daniel Fisher: Go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. So I was asking about the chemical industry and CapEx being allocated towards chemical recycling and trying to replicate a circular economy dynamics similar to aluminum. There's also several bioresin alternatives being commercialized. And many CPG customers are very public with their interest in recycled plastics. So as you kind of reconcile all of that? How do you sort of think about those variables as it relates to the growth?
John Hayes: Yes. It's a great question. Here's how I'd reconcile it. Let's not forget that the aluminum container is the only container in a recycling stream that has economic value as we sit here today. You add on chemical recycling to plastic, you're just adding cost onto that. Many of our customers, we recognize that they have profit pools within the plastic industry and they're candidly trying to protect that. I would, too. I don't -- I completely understand where they're coming from. But the brutal reality is when you think about the amount of actually even usable recycled material in plastic, it's still in the single digits. Will chemical recycling change that? Yes, it could, but not on a wholesale basis because there's costs involved in doing that. And furthermore, it's not going to fundamentally change that we have a single-use plastic problem in the world full stop. And when you have recycling rates of beverage cans, above 70%, and we have publicly stated goals to try and get them as an industry above 90%, that means that you're not having any substantial product of aluminum going into landfills and otherwise polluting the environment, I think it's a tall put as we sit here right now to think about plastic and even get close to what we've already been achieving.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari: John, you indicated I think COVID walk downs haven't, for the most part, negatively impacted global growth. I'm just wondering, as you look at the last 12 months, do you have any thought or concern that the very strong demand that you and your customers have seen has been boosted by at-home consumption that might roll off to some extent, hopefully, as COVID becomes less of an issue? Or just any kind of thoughts you can give on that kind of at-home versus on-premise dynamic over the last year?
John Hayes: Great question, and my comments will be more qualitative because I can't point to specific data. But we've been spending much more time at home. And I think the consumer were at large, and we have done some research on that, is much more aware of the waste that we are creating because we have to throw it in our garbage cans every day. We're no longer, as we sit here today, as much of an on-the-go society than we were, and we didn't worry about that. So that's one data point that's important to point out. The other one is kind of the on-premise, off-premise because the off-premise has benefited at the expense of the on-premise. But our conversations with the on-premise suggest that when we go back, the question is, for example, in beer, how much draft is going to be there when you have glasses sitting there, and people are going to have concerns about the sanitization thereof. And so what we've been hearing and is that a lot of the on-premise is looking to go to much more single-use beverages, meaning cans and bottles. And so I don't know, Dan, if you have anything else to add, but those are 2 big data points we've been focused on.
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I think one thing, and I think John touched on this. We're -- I don't know what the size of the flex work, work-life balance has shifted in terms of a permanent shift, but that's a very real thing. And we're dealing with it here. I mean, we're a company that at 80%, 90% of our folks come to work historically before this happened, and we're very much going to be -- we've all realized that we can do our jobs from anywhere with the technology. And if you're doing those from home or you're doing those from your apartment or your studio, you're going to be drinking packaged goods. So the can will benefit, and that will be here for quite some time. I think the other thing that we're paying close attention to, and it probably goes without saying, but I'll restate it here. The market is incredibly tight. As a result of that, we know a number of our customers are limiting their innovation releases in cans.  So yes, there's been a lot of new products that have come on to the market. They've overwhelmingly been in cans, but there have been an awful lot of other products because they can't find cans that haven't been released. And so even if there's going to be a shift in terms of consumption patterns and volume and folks do go back to bars, we understand that, that's going to happen. I think there's still an awful lot of pent-up demand and innovation that is going to, hopefully, offset that. And in aggregate, when we look at that, again, this is why we think what we said at our Investor Day, we're there or thereabouts or potentially even better, depending on what happens with these end-consumer behavior patterns coming out of COVID.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just following up on that comment on innovation. There were a few trials of still water in cans slated for last year. They got a lot of attention before COVID kind of disrupted everything. Is it possible to talk about how the can is doing with still water? Is that something that's been maybe pushed back or maybe capacity constrained with fewer cans available? Just any kind of broad comments on that opportunity?
Daniel Fisher: Sure. The products that were in existence are doing well. I mean, double-digit growth coming off of a low base. The issue, as you said, has a lot more to do with the retailers, not -- they've consistently quarter-over-quarter pushed off, adopting new products just to manage the accelerated velocity and all the other products that are on their shelves and making sure those supply chains are robust. So we're still having very positive conversations, and we look forward to when we get out of this COVID environment that you'll see a lot of those innovations coming online and some fairly significant well-recognizable brands. So...
John Hayes: And to Dan's point, we are capacity constrained right now. So if you're a still water company thinking about going into cans, it's very tight. That's one of the reasons why we've been accelerating our investments to kind of free up some capacity to really kind of push those things because right now, the reality is we don't have the cans to supply those people that are looking to go into it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George Staphos: I wanted to go back through the question on start-up costs. Maybe we look at a slightly different angle. I know you're looking forward to the question. But -- and really projected out into cash flow for next year to the extent that we can comment for '22. So over the last few quarters, we've talked about start-up costs. You've talked about being able to lessen their effect as you have this high-class problem of trying to build in capacity. What do you do from here so less than the effect? Or should we really bake in a $50 million kind of ongoing start-up cost every year, given the degree to which capacity is growing? And given the CapEx ramp this year, should we not expect an accelerated pickup in operating cash flow because you start to get the return on that in 2022? How would you comment to those points, guys?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, I think you're exactly right, George. We'll see the acceleration in operating cash flow. We will have significant start-up in '21 because we're starting really 2, 2.5 with Bowling Green, large facilities. So the start-up costs will be elevated when we're doing greenfield facilities, really in North America. The costs become less. The Czech Republic launch will be less because the labor is a heck of a lot less. So you can break people and South America is a lot less with Frutal. That will be less because the labor base just isn't as expensive. And to Dan's point, we found through previous startups, bringing these people in earlier, getting them trained, having redundancy is really important to make sure that then you kind of hit your start-up curve. So I would say it will track with greenfield facility that will be elevated with greenfield facilities in North America, but you're still going to get more than that benefit through the growth in operating cash flow and earnings as these things ramp up.
John Hayes: Perhaps strategic another way to think about it. Dan referenced it earlier. In our business, what we've talked -- and I'm talking more about the beverage can side of the business. But for every 1 percentage point increase in volume, over time, strategically, we ought to get a 2x flow through on the margin side of that. So Dan said we're going to be low double digits. So call it, just for discussion, let's just call it 10%. That ought to say, we -- in a perfect world, we ought to have a 20% earnings growth and that operating earnings growth. But that's in a perfect world, then we have the start-up costs. So reduce the start-up cost from that, I think that's a good basis by which to strategically think about this.
George Staphos: Next question I had, there's been a couple of questions on innovation. One, are you seeing any sign of exhaustion? I'm guessing the answer is going to be no, but from your consumer studies, any exhaustion on the whole spiked delta category? And as you bring on this next wave of cans, are we going to see just more new flavored spike seltzers? Or are there other categories to the extent that you can comment that will perpetuate the innovation angle? How would you think about that? How would you have us think about that?
Daniel Fisher: Yes, it's a great question. I -- and we touched on this in a little detail at the Investor Day. So if I go back to how I was characterizing or how we were thinking about, it's really -- we look at alcohol innovation. So spike cells is a part of that. And we know there's all sorts of innovation that's happening in that space. So it's -- do we think spike is going to continue to grow at 200%? No. It's -- there is a spot where we think it gets to, and many people have referenced kind of light beer market share kind of in that range. Okay. Maybe. But we're -- George, we've talked about this a number of times. We're still incredibly bullish on the alcohol space on the fact that spirits are shifting into cans, which was unheard of for a decade plus. And so the more innovation that's showing up into cans in the alcohol space, I think you're going to start to see I don't know what we're going to call it spike or something else. But I think you'll continue to see new innovation coming out in cans, and that should benefit us.
John Hayes: Yes. Just to -- think about the teas, the spike teas that are, I think you're going to see a big surge of those in 2021. Is that a spike seltzer or not? I think that's Dan's point. It doesn't matter. It's in the alcohol space and it's innovation in the can.
George Staphos: Understood. My last one, and I'll turn it over we haven't seen that many capacity announcements for Southeast Asia, even though given our work, that market also looks to be pretty tight. What do you -- what would you have us take away on Ball's view of that region and its attractiveness. And if you keep running to South America at 10% to 15% capacity, given our work, you're going to need another camp plant there pretty soon. I know that's been the narrative, this whole call you're out of capacity. But how would you have us think about the prospects for next plant in South America?
John Hayes: Yes. George, you just said South America, but I think you mean Southeast Asia?
Daniel Fisher: Both.
George Staphos: So I put them together, 2 for 1 there, John. Southeast Asia...
John Hayes: Well, to be honest, it's a bit of an apple and a pear for Ball Corporation. As you know, we're very big in South America. We're not all that big in Southeast Asia. We are I think our ability to grow, in some ways, limited by our resources. And it's not just the capital, it's the people, all the things that Dan has done a great job and really redefining our processes and reimagining to the onboarding of people, to the capital equipment and everything in between. I think so it gets down to a prioritization issue. And we see the returns in the places where we have the greatest leverage, which is North and Central America, EMEA and South America to be greater than Southeast Asia. Does that mean we're not looking Southeast Asia? Of course not. But we have partners in Southeast Asia, and we just think the greatest bang for the buck for us as shareholders are doing what we're currently doing right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.
Mark Wilde: I wondered, first, Dan, if we could just talk about what drove that 20% volume growth in Northern Europe in the fourth quarter? And if we're seeing an acceleration in growth in Europe, whether there's an opportunity to start to improve some of the European contracts in the way that you've done in North America over the last few years?
Daniel Fisher: Yes, thanks for that question. Let me characterize the fourth quarter and these aren't misprints. I referenced these a couple of times, I think. In the U.K., we saw growth for the can of 17% in the fourth quarter. In Germany, we saw 17%. Spain, 15%; Italy, 13%; we even saw 10% growth in France and Russia continues to be kind of north of 15%. So it's really everywhere. I think you asked about Northern Europe, but it's everywhere in Europe. The million dollar question, the million dollar EVA question that you asked is what's happening in Europe, which is different than North America and South America, North America and South America got tight, a lot tighter, a lot faster over the last 18 months. And we're starting to see that in Europe right now. And that's sort of what you need in order to reevaluate the landscape of your contracts. I will tell you at the gross profit line, we do really well in Europe. So I think it's -- it may be as much to do with tightening the terms and conditions, like we have had the opportunity to do with in other parts of the world. But it's certainly something we're focused on and engaged with, with our team there. And we're kind of at the precipice of having a market that looks similar to the other regions in terms of how tight it is to potentially be able to influence, so I don't know if that helps.
Mark Wilde: That actually, that helps a lot, Dan. I wondered just toggling back to Brazil for just a second. My -- from my trips on there, it seemed like most of the can market in Brazil is beer. We look here in North America, about 60% of the can market is nonalcohol. What's the opportunity in Brazil and Latin America more broadly to move the nonalcoholic beverage market more toward cans?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. It's a great question. I think in Brazil, particularly, there is -- you're dealing with tax structures and the longevity of what the folks that you would expect to see significant shifts or a more normalized package mix, a lot of it just has to do with where they make their money and the profit pools associated with that. Having said that, sustainability is becoming more and more something that all of the countries in South America are concerned about. And that will continue to build and put pressure on helping to make that shift. I think we need a combination of a more neutral tax structure on the different disparate profit pools, coupled with sustainability trends to continue to improve. The one thing that's incredibly bullish, though, is, as you said, the overwhelming beverage market for cans in beer, and that pack mix continues to shift to cans. And a lot of new innovation is coming out in the alcohol market in cans as well. So not too dissimilar to what you've seen in the last decade, North America, more recent from an innovation standpoint. So even if CSD, for instance, doesn't shift, we're in a really good growth pace for the next 5 years plus.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Last one for me. Just briefly on can sheet. I wondered if you can talk about what you're doing with suppliers to ensure a supply of can sheet? And whether you're doing this more on a regional basis that might be a little more amendable to kind of developing circular recycling structures?
Daniel Fisher: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, again, similar to a number of data points, where we saw this kind of tailwind and growth trajectory several years ago. And learned through difficult times with the previous administration and tariffs that we needed a more robust and a more global surety of supply chain as it relates to rolling mills. We have north of 20 different contracts around the world with mills. And so we're in a good spot. It may not be localized exactly where we want it, depending on performance of all the mills, but we have access to metal, which is the most important thing right now. And all the conversations we're having with the supply base, ,to your point, it's get it where we're making the cans, get it close to the facilities, get it close to where the recycling and scrap stream is because all of that going to enable us to step into all these tremendous attributes of the can. We need it local. We want it to be circular. And I think we'll start to see some more investment in North America, in particular, as it relates to that.
John Hayes: Dmitra, maybe we'll take one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank.
Kyle White: I just want to follow-up quickly on Mark's. The regional growth in EMEA is tremendous, but can you dig a bit more into what beverage categories drove this? And why did we all ascendancy this level of growth in 4Q, not necessarily 3Q or even 2Q?
Daniel Fisher: Well, 2Q and even parts of 3Q were don't underestimate. There's still a bunch of countries over there. It's not Europe. And COVID certainly had impacts on the freight side and what channels were open, et cetera. So I think 4Q was a more normalized consumption behavior pattern, number one. And I would say the U.K. was CSD and beer grew. But when you talk about Italy, Spain, Russia, that's heavy beer, and heavy beer growth. And then the rest of the market is -- it's overwhelming beer, but in some spots like the U.K., you saw nice growth in other categories.
Kyle White: Got it. And then just one question, last question here. I wanted to shift gears, your favorite question on aerospace. Sales are approaching $2 billion here now. Backlog is strong. So just kind of wondering how you view that business in terms of its fit within the Ball portfolio and whether you think it has a large enough base to be a stand alone business?
John Hayes: It's growing very strongly. It's a great business, and we always look at those types of things. And we in the current environment, and we -- what we're trying to do is we will always -- let me answer it differently. We will always be looking at is to maximize the value to Ball corporation shareholders. And let's not forget that management and the Board of our company own well over $1 billion of Ball Corporation stock, actually, a couple of billion dollars. So as a result, we're focused on how to maximize the long-term value of our company. And if that means keeping it together, great. If that means there's a better way to play it, great. But as we see right now, we've got 3 different businesses, the beverage can business, aluminum aerosol business, aerospace business and soon-to-be a cups business that we all think are great. They're growing, and we have more opportunities right now than I've ever seen in my life at Ball.  Dmitra, I think we're all finished. So I want to thank everyone for your participation. Stay safe -- excuse me, be well, and we look forward to talking to you in a few months. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 5, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you, Dimitra, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2020 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest Form 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release financials include descriptions of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other non-reportable segments. Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the Global Beverage Packaging performance and trends. Scott will discuss the key financial metrics. And then, we'll finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses, as well as our outlook for the company. Let me begin by thanking those of you who joined our Virtual Investor Day in early October. We appreciate the high level of attendance and engagement. The event was a great opportunity for us to highlight our culture, sustainability leadership and capabilities while laying out our long-term investment plans to address sustainable organic growth in our businesses, and deliver the Ball equation of at least 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth over the long term, while meaningfully growing our EVA dollars. If you were unable to join the Virtual Investor Day, a webcast replay of the event as well as a transcript and supporting slides and resources are available at www.ball.com/investors under the Presentations tab. Now, moving on to today's commentary. Third quarter results were very strong, and the positive momentum across our businesses continues. Ongoing strength in global beverage volumes and future expected growth supported by numerous long-term contracts are proof points for an increased CapEx in 2020 and beyond. Our focus remains on working safely, executing on numerous capital projects, and investing in talent, training, processes and systems to deliver our long-term growth. Our third quarter comparable operating earnings grew 14%, and comparable diluted earnings per share increased 27% driven by our North and Central American beverage business, our EMEA beverage business, and our aerospace business. Dan Fisher will elaborate more on our beverage segments in a moment. But over the course of the quarter, global beverage can demand, which was up 9% in the quarter, continues to outstrip supply, and our beverage can businesses in each region are sold out in events of new capacity coming online. We're thankful to all of our colleagues and contractors executing startups of new lines and facilities across our global network. In our aerospace business, we continue to see strong growth with quarterly year-over-year revenues up 21%, comparable operating income up 26%, and our won-not-booked backlog of 14% since the second quarter of 2020. Significant progress has been made on the previously disclosed aerospace supply chain issue, and we believe our supplier and our program team have the matter under control. Now, last night, we announced the well-deserved retirement of Rob Strain as Senior Vice President of the corporation and President of our aerospace business as well as the promotion of Dave Kaufman, currently Chief Operating Officer of our aerospace business, to succeed him. Rob has done a fantastic job of leading and growing our aerospace business over the past eight years, and we're excited for him as he enters his new phase of life. He's done a great job in preparing Dave for these new responsibilities, and we all are very excited for Dave to continue to drive the business for greater success. Other highlights around the company include our aluminum aerosol business successfully closed on the aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. We welcome the Itupeva team to the Ball family. Our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility will be starting up very shortly here during the fourth quarter, and our cups Amazon platform and accelerated retail launches are at or above our expectations. While our aerospace business has hired approximately 750 people to-date, our global beverage business has hired over 1,250 year-to-date, and we have significantly increased our efforts around employee onboarding, training and development to ensure smooth startups of our various projects. And since the Investor Day, and to further enhance getting the word out about our sustainable aluminum packaging solutions, Ball announced this global partnership with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment at three marquee venues in Denver, which is now the Ball arena, Los Angeles and London. Our partnership's shared vision is to advance sustainability in sports and entertainment by strengthening recycling, providing fans with an enhanced environmentally-friendly experience, and showcasing aluminum beverage packaging is the most sustainable choice. Denver's Ball Arena will become the first-ever professional sports venue with exclusively aluminum packaging, whether it be cans, cups or bottles for its cold beverages. Before I turn it over to Dan and Scott, I do want to thank our colleagues here at Ball for being who they are, caring for one another, being vigilant with their physical and mental well-being, and living our culture. Your dedication and hard work to support our customers, our communities and the local economies where we operate is forever appreciated. Thank you. So, in summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength in this new environment. Despite the rise in global confirmed cases of COVID-19 recently, we exited the quarter with continued momentum, and are excited to bring additional capacity online as quickly and as safely as possible, and continue to believe that the overall strength of our business will allow us to further grow operating earnings this year and beyond. We also want to extend our well wishes to everyone for persevering, and we wish all of you listening for your continued safety and good health. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. I also want to thank our employees, customers and supply chain for their collaboration to maintain our industry's ability to serve consumer demand. In North America and EMEA, we would typically see a seasonal slowdown by this time in the year. However, our global beverage teams in all regions continue to operate at maximum capacity. Our operations, HR and environmental health and safety professionals continue to keep our Ball family safe and vigilant, which will enable our ability to respond to our customers' and consumers' growing demand. As we laid out at our Virtual Investor Day, it is an exciting beverage can market with more customers and consumers choosing sustainable aluminum packaging for their beverage of choice. By 2025, we expect the global beverage can industry to grow by approximately 100 billion units. To serve Ball's approved and contracted demand for sustainable aluminum beverage packaging, our team will be adding at least 25 billion units of capacity by year-end 2023. And by 2025, we see opportunities to add as much as 45 billion units of capacity. As we discussed on recent investor calls, our work to drive true circularity and diversity and inclusion initiatives is having a profound effect on our business. As John mentioned, Ball is hiring a significant amount of new employees, and these initiatives as well as Ball's culture are attracting incredibly talented next-generation employees to Ball. As we look forward, we are thankful that our new lines in Fort Worth and Rome have ramped up successfully. And our two new plants in Glendale, Arizona, and in Pittston, Pennsylvania, are well on their way to provide much needed capacity by mid-2021 and beyond. In addition, our global plant network outside of the US has expanded capabilities in the UK and Eastern Europe, and our new two-line beverage can plant in Frutal, Brazil, will supply additional cans to the fast-growing Brazilian can market. In North America, beverage cans' third quarter volumes grew 6% with half of that growth coming from inventory, drawdown and imports. Going forward, we see volume growth greater than 6% over the next three to five years. And since the Investor Day, we have executed additional customers' contracts, which are longer in duration than the average three to five-year timeframe. In EMEA, segment volumes were up 6% for the quarter due to strength in the UK, Nordics and Russia. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends improved throughout the quarter, and positive momentum continued into the fourth. Additional capital projects in the UK and across Eastern Europe provided needed capacity, and we foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits in 2020 and beyond. In South America, volumes were up 30% in the third quarter, driven by increased package mix for aluminum cans in the beer category. Year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter was dampened due to adverse customer mix that will moderate by 2021, and higher cost inventory being carried over from second quarter created by curtailed lines during the height of the pandemic. Beverage cans have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates, and package mix on the shelf remains in the 60% range versus a rate of 50% at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Following discussion with customers in Brazil, we anticipate can growth in the mid- to high-teens, and can mix on the shelf remaining high beyond 2020, and we will bring numerous line additions online in mid-2021. Given our recent Virtual Investor Day, I'll save some extra time to take your questions during Q&A. In summary, global beverage can demand was very strong during the third quarter, and momentum is building for the remainder of 2020 and beyond. Thank you, again, to all of our teams around the globe. 2020 has provided us all with unprecedented challenges, and you've risen to the challenge, time and time again. Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up, and stay safe during the holiday season. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.89 versus $0.70 in 2019. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect strong North American beverage, EMEA beverage and aerospace segment results, and a lower share count offset by higher corporate costs and startup costs related to our new cups business. Due to the pass through of lower cost aluminum and the 2019 sale of the Argentine steel aerosol business and Chinese beverage can assets, revenues for the first quarter were not as high in comparison to unit volume growth. Ball's balance sheet is healthy, and we have focused near term on maintaining ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. Year-to-date, we experienced our seasonal working capital build, which was more sizeable than typical, due largely to previously disclosed timing of metal payments. As a result of this timing, ongoing growth initiatives and raw material supply to support them, we anticipate the full-year 2020 working capital investment to be a use of cash in the range of $350 million, which is slightly higher due to accelerating growth conditions. As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind. Our full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 17%, full-year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million and full-year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other, non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $55 million. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be strong, and longer term, we see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. We will be investing even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity in North America, EMEA and South America, while also investing in our aluminum cups business. With this growth, we also anticipate working capital to be a use of cash, but it's too early to quantify the amount at this time. Contrary to past sizable M&A deals, Ball is embarking on a multiyear phase of internal investments to serve organic growth for beverage cans, and support new contracted volumes. At this point, 2020 CapEx is expected to exceed $900 million. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash, and will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our strong operating cash flow, we are managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively, and consistently returning value to our long-term shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aluminum aerosol business saw global volumes in the quarter decline low-teens, driven primarily by double-digit growth in India offset by double-digit declines in Europe and North America. Looking ahead, we welcome our new colleagues from the Tubex acquisition in Brazil, and we look forward to integrating the plant into our global aerosol operations. As mentioned previously, our aerospace business reported approximately 21% revenue growth, 26% segment earnings growth due to strong contract performance offset by some continued operational inefficiencies created by the COVID-19 environment. Looking ahead, the growth trajectory of the business is even stronger with contracted backlog growing 14% since second quarter, and won-not-booked backlog at $4.9 billion. We continue to be very excited about the long-term prospects of the business as well. In summary, Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth while delivering value to our shareholders. As we sit here today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share greater than our long-term goal of 10% to 15% in 2020 is certainly in our reach. Our teams will do everything possible to outperform this, while being keenly focused on working safely and executing capital investments. Beyond 2020, we look forward to driving our business to deliver long-term diluted earnings per share growth of at least 10% to 15%, and achieve or exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year on our growing invested capital base. Our time is now, and we are thankful to one another, and the exciting opportunities in front of us at Ball. And with that, Dimitra, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess, just first off, given how tight supply/demand will be in 2021 in North America, how should we sort of think about the impact of auto pattern production relative to normal seasonality in 4Q and perhaps in 1Q? I mean, I assume you'll try to minimize seasonal downtime. So, just any color you could provide on that. And then, the second part of that question is on the imports of Canada to North America, which regions did you ship in from, and how did that dynamic impact your segment profitability specific to 3Q?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I guess the first part of the question is, I guess, you get the sense that we're going to be running all out. Little things that I think specifically the North America team has been doing in particular, I think we've gone to much deeper statistical models on how to run our M&R. So, we're actually hoping to pick up a day or two in terms of less downtime heading into next year. But there is really no seasonality relative to curtailments or typical downtime. We're just going to continue to run all out. And one of the things that I think most of the folks on the call understand is in second and third quarter, there's really no ability to ramp up via our customer networks. They're already traditionally running full out. So, at times like now where they have filling capacity for cans, we will be stepping into that. And there's some momentum and hope for a little stronger fourth quarter than is normal just with the desire to move some of the cans filling and getting away from just in time inventory constraints that a lot of our major customers are enabling. And then, the second question, traditionally for us, we continue to partner with a lot of our joint ventures around the world where we have minority stakes, and we're tapping into a much more global network supply-demand, supply chain process and forecasting process. So, cans are coming from Southeast Asia. They're coming from Korea. They're coming from Africa. They're coming from Central America. The majority of what we're shipping though is continuing to balance, and a lot of it has to do with year-over-year that the beer market was really deemed nonessential in Mexico. So, we used in the second quarter and even the third quarter, we probably have a higher concentration of shipments coming up from Mexico. We will continue to use every route available around the world now that we have a much better process, a much more agile process, and there will continue to be imports heading into next year. But hopefully, the faster we're ramping up obviously, the domestic supply and the domestic cans they don't burden our customer base with the longer inventory supply chain, and the higher freight cost is all going to be hugely helpful. So, we're trying to manage a much more disconnected, much more fragmented supply chain. But our customers will be the beneficiaries of this domestic supply coming online. And we hope to get it to them sooner than we're planning right now.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, just second question, do you feel that supply chain inventory levels in Europe were relatively aligned as you exited 3Q? And how do you sort of think the second set of lockdowns will impact you in the region relative to the first one?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. We've been – so, right now, the lockdowns aren't as constrained, if you will, as the early parts of the spring in general with Europe. I think last Friday, we saw the Nordics and Germany, that border has been shut. Our plan right now is to continue to run, run full out. The demand profile is still right in line from a shipment basis to what we expected entering the quarter. We obviously have – we're mirroring – our workforce is mirroring a lot of the hotspots within areas of Europe. But up to now, we're still running. We still plan to run. Our projects are on time. And worst-case scenario, we have a small build of inventory, which we probably need heading into next year. But right now, I'm not seeing much change from what we anticipated from a forecast standpoint even six, eight weeks ago from a demand standpoint.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Awesome. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Brazil obviously did quite well in the quarter, but we've seen some comments from brewers saying they want to try to get back to their pre-COVID pack mix of about 50/50 between glass and cans. Is that consistent with what you're seeing so far in 4Q, and do you think you can kind of offset that with just the underlying demand in the region?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: We are not seeing – two things. We're not seeing it in terms of the current pack mix. And we're also not hearing that and we're hearing the opposite actually from the strategic that would really move the needle in that arena. And so, yeah, that's somewhat news to us. And in fact, the trends all throughout South America whether it's Chile, whether it's Peru, Ecuador, the move toward cans from returnable glass is being driven as much by the retailers not wanting to carry the inventory swell of glass and the perishable nature of it. And if you really look at a number of the customers in Brazil specifically that are winning, they are winning with specialty can introductions, and a different recipe of beer that's moving away from the corn base. And so, that's what we're – those are the conversations we're having with our large customers, and that's what we're investing behind. So, not aligned 100% with those comments.
Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And do you anticipate any impact from rising freight costs in North America in either 4Q or 1Q? And can you remind us how you pass along those costs after your recent round of contract renegotiations?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yes. That would have been an issue probably 36 months ago. It is – I think we've corrected those types of pass-through where we're burdening the inefficiencies in our freights in our system and our supply chain on about 80% of the contracts. There's still a little bit of exposure there, but most of what we're seeing now is given how tight it is. If we're talking about spot freight arrangements, we're able to negotiate even with the 20% that hasn't been fully corrected in longer-term contracts. We're able to have very different freight discussions if we have to shift to a different can size or a location that hasn't been forecast ahead of time. So, it's very minimal. We're keeping our eye on it, though.
Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Morning.
Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: In North and Central America, operating earnings grew about 33% against the mid-single-digit volume increase. So, can you just help bridge for us like how much the earnings improvement came from improved operational efficiency, lack of scrap headwind, and perhaps some benefits from the new contractual terms? And how should we think about the level of improvement in the segment in the fourth quarter?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. This is Scott. They had really good margin performance. A lot of it is much more efficient in the production processes that we have versus a year ago. I would say the one thing to think about in the fourth quarter is we'll have more startup than we had last year. We had virtually no startup costs in the fourth quarter last year. And as we wrap up Glendale and Pittston, we'll see some of that in the fourth quarter. So, I wouldn't expect that margin performance to remain in the fourth quarter, but it'll still be good.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And I do think that what you're seeing particularly in the third quarter that you're seeing, as Scott mentioned, good operating performance, but you're also seeing the benefits of long term what we've talked strategically from a commercial point of view as well, whether it's mix, whether it's terms, whether it's the freight that we were just talking about, it's a whole host of things, and so it's – our North American beverage can team is hitting on all cylinders, which is exciting.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: One thing to keep in mind as we're transitioning in the fourth quarter, and we talked a lot about it last year, was the scrap headwinds. They lapsed basically at the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, what you saw in Q1, Q2 and Q3 with improved contracts, we had nice year-over-year benefits in all three of those quarters. That benefit won't be as pronounced in the fourth quarter because metal moved in closer to the scrap differential.
Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's all very helpful context. And then, in South America, you mentioned diverse customer mix and higher cost inventory impacting earnings for the quarter. Can you just quantify how much of an impact each of that had on 3Q segment results? And do you expect any lingering impact in the fourth quarter?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I would say what we've characterized and we don't have a professional process to earmark COVID impacts, but what we believe is somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 million of higher cost inventory that rolled from Q2 into Q3. And with the rate we're selling right now in Q3, I believe all of that inventory would have been consumed in the third quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. The real thing – issue, though, has to do with the mix of both size of end customer. And as we go into the fourth quarter, yeah, we expect some of that to continue. But as Dan said in his prepared remarks, going into 2021, particularly as we go through 2021 and beyond, we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to get those – that margin profile back to, if not historic levels, much better than it was in the third quarter.
Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Right. Thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to ask about performance in Europe. You were slightly ahead of us there. Could you just contextualize that? You noted that maybe you don't see as many headwinds from COVID-related shutdowns, I think. But, yeah, what else could you, I guess, add to the performance in Europe?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: We – it's almost the counter of what happened in South America. We actually benefited from some more favorable regional mix and customer mix there. That was the big driver.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Appreciate that. And then, I guess there have been obviously a lot of capacity announcements. You guys talked about the opportunity to add 25 billion units, and then potentially even 45 billion units. You've made some announcements about new plants as well. How should we think about the phasing in of that capacity? Could you just remind us of the cadence of how that evolves over the next couple of years?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure. I would. Let's focus on 2021 for now because the other items that we've earmarked we're still working on the plants and the execution phase. But what we've communicated previously is we should exit the year 2021 with an incremental 6 billion units of capacity being put into North America. That number can increase. I think there've been comments that we've shared relative to the fact that we're building candidly bigger structures. So, the speed and the timing where we can execute longer-term contracts we will then be able to move pretty quickly on the process equipment. And we've demonstrated we can hire at a very fast rate. So, the 6 billion could be higher. And as we make those decisions to invest in additional lines, we'll certainly comment on that. It could be as much as 10 billion. In Europe, it's – we're investing and we've commented on that in the UK, in Eastern Europe, and we're executing against our short-term growth plans in Russia. We've also added some in-capacity in Poland. So, all of those things are happening to keep pace with the higher-end of the growth rates that I discussed at the Investor Day in Europe. And we've commented on about 2 billion units of additional capacity coming online by the end of the year in South America. Those were the most, I think, succinct comments and the most concrete volume lifts. Rest assured, we've been having ongoing conversations with customers, and we have a number of opportunities to speed the rate of volume increase that most of that will probably happen for 2022. And as those come to fruition, we'll certainly be communicating those.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. That was great detail. And then, lastly, just on the buyback front, is there any concrete plans you could share for 2021 as to how much you'd be deploying into buybacks? Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. As we've talked about before, we're in a growth mode, so we'll probably orient more of that free cash flow or more of our cash flow to be investing in our business. So, at this point, we'll buy enough so that we're not issuing shares as it relates from option plans and things like that. But at this point, we don't have any defined buyback plans for 2021.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: One thing I'll just add that we talk a fair amount internally is even after all this internal growth CapEx, we're still generating free cash flow with the earnings growth on a net leverage basis. We're actually deleveraging in that way. And so, we're very cognizant. We're all big shareholders, so, we're very cognizant of that fact, and whether it's every quarter with our board talking about dividends, talking about share repurchases, we have those discussions each and every quarter.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: But as it...
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: ...relates to that, we don't expect to de-lever, so you think about the plug being share buyback and dividends.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are well. Scott, a couple for you. Just one on free cash flow. I think you indicated working cap would be an additional use of $50 million compared to what you communicated three months ago. Are you updating your free cash flow guidance just based on that or are you keeping it in the range of $400 million?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. I think we're increasing both the CapEx spend that we're going to spend over $900 million this year. And we're also going to have a little more investment in working capital. So, think of the difference year-over-year, about half of the difference from last year will be increased capital spend, and the other half being increased working capital.
Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. One more on CapEx, Scott. So, you talked about growth CapEx being in excess of $1 billion over the next couple of years, and over the next five years for that matter. Can you talk about just in light of how big the growth CapEx will be, what you're expecting maintenance to be at least over the next year or two?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think, maintenance ramps up a little bit as you bring on new plants. But it's still in the $275 million to $300 million range. And think of a new plant that comes online, these are bigger plants. So, you might have $3 million of maintenance a year in a plant like that.
Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Got it. Okay. On the import topic, Dan or John, can you talk about how much you – how high you expect North American imports to be this year, $4 billion, $5 billion, whatever you think the number is, and how much lower you think they'll be next year? And just relatedly, you talked about the market being short $10 billion at your Analyst Day. How much unmet demand do you think will have been the case upon the conclusion of this year?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. The unmet demand is pretty hard to couch. I can tell you on that one, I know that there are – and why I'm hesitant to give you a number there, I can tell you that the speed with which innovations are coming in the alcohol space, that's what has been curtailed. And so, the success rate of those new products is hard to – it's hard to earmark. But that's really where we're seeing it. I think you'd see a much greater proliferation of new product launches, all-in cans, all-in specialty containers. And I'm hesitant to make a call on how big those could be. Yeah. I think we referenced about 10 million units being undersold. My belief is that 2021 will look similar in terms of the number of imports, just because a lot of these ramp-ups will be happening throughout the year. And depending on when our customers, especially in the alcohol space, get comfortable that they can launch these new products, and then put some – put can volume behind it if they're wildly successful, that will be a contributing factor to just how long that import number kind of sits in that same range. I would think it starts to moderate by 2023 and 2024. But again, so much of this is going to be how much more space are retailers going to provide in North America alcohol. It seems like there's a real discernible belief that that's driving a lot of foot traffic. And as that continues to grow, there's a space for it. There'll be an ability for new products to be launched. And again, those are going to be in cans. So, difficult to make a call on the import, but I would perceive two to three years at least at a pretty high level, maybe similar to what we're seeing now.
Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning, John, Dan, Scott. This is actually John (37:18) on for Phil. Congrats on the strong print, and hope you're all doing well. I first wanted to ask on Europe. You noted in the release that it provided minimal cans into North America. Could you give us a little more details on that? Is that because the local demand got tighter or maybe North America was a little bit less than you had expected to warrant those imports from that region? And then, maybe you can kind of touch on how you're thinking of that region going forward. You talked about a little bit with the buildup of inventory hopefully in 4Q maybe with some of the lockdowns. But is this potentially setting up for a tighter environment in India? And could that be positive for pricing negotiations maybe as you go through next year?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Let me try to take the first question about exports from Europe. There's two things. And number one, yes, it's been incredibly tight as referenced to our kind of historical performance here in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in Q4 even with the lockdown. The cans sizes are slightly different, not to get too technical. So, you've got to have the right cans in the right spot able to run the right labels in order to ship them and then fill them in North America. And the folks that are fundamentally able to do that are folks big CPG companies that are in control of their primary filling. And so, you're not talking to every customer about those opportunities, you're talking to the few that can actually execute. And to your very good point, I mean, we need all the cans and then some in Europe. So, we're doing our best to make sure that we are managing allocations in an equitable way, in a fair way, and where there are pockets of opportunity for us to run a few cans for export, we will do that, it's just you've got to have all the stars lined up to make sure that supply chains are able to absorb them, film them, and get them into the retail outlets.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Let me give you some – a little additional color around it. The overall packaged liquid volume was down in Europe, was down low- to mid-single digits, but yet the can was up, we think in or around where Ball is, 6%, 7% increase. So, the can is clearly taking share. And so, I'd say that, as we go into the fourth quarter, we see those trends still continuing. So, what Dan, was talking about is, if things slow down because of these lockdowns in Europe, our inventories are so low right now, we're just going to be replenishing inventory. So, we're not concerned about that. As you go into first quarter, second quarter, these lockdowns continue, well then, obviously you're going to have to revisit that. But as we sit here right now at early November, looking into the end of the year, we should be in pretty good shape.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And your last question on pricing, the Eurozone is not a monolith. So, yes, there are tighter markets, and economics would dictate that supply demand. If it works, then it should provide us with some opportunities. We haven't had those conversations as of yet. But we're entering into some different dialogue.
Unknown Speaker: Got it. Thanks for the color. And then, just one more for John. I think you mentioned that you're seeing some longer-term customer contracts, I believe you're saying in North America. Is that just at the higher-end of the three- to five-year range that you take out of your customer contracts or is that going well beyond that? And is that something that you think you could see more of going forward as demand is going to be tight or expected to be tight for the next three to five years?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think it was actually Dan who said that, and he said longer than the typical...
Unknown Speaker: Apologies.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: ...three to five years. And what I would say, yes, kind of trending more towards five to seven years depending on what the customer is, and for exactly the reason you said and that we've been talking about. When we have environments like this, and we've been talking with our customers for a couple of years that we see because of the sustainability trends, because we see the new product growth, because of the consumer demanding more sustainable packaging, we think this is a long-term secular thing, and our customers are beginning to see that as well as understanding it. And so, they're going a bit longer, and we're delighted to help them with that, particularly as we make these new investments.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And keep in mind...
Unknown Speaker: Got it.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: ...that the three- to five-year historical context is coming in a North America market that was – that had excess capacity. And so, we're completely full in any conversation that we're having right now to grow required investment. And I think that's a lot of times when Scott's referencing, these are good contracts, but they look different. They look different in terms of the length of the contract, and they look different in terms of the economics associated with them.
Unknown Speaker: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, and good morning, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think in your release, you called out SKU rationalizations with certain customers. Curious if that's more driven by you being selective in terms of what you can or are able to serve your customers or rather that your customers being more selective in terms of kind of what they want to emphasize or put into the market. And relatedly, does that positively at all impact your business mix at all?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Great question. I would say we – it's ultimately our customers' call. We work with them, and some of the conversations would basically boil down to if you have those three can sizes on one line, and you want to launch those different labels, we can give you X cans or you can constrain it and we can give you Y cans, and in this environment, they're – Y being more, they're taking fewer labels to get more volume because they don't have the pub and bar infrastructure to sell through as John has indicated earlier on the call. This is the opportunity, and this is the market they have. So, constraining the market tiers on product launches and SKU proliferation is benefiting, and I think you could see a lot of the big CPG companies that took that to heart early in the pandemic, Their results were extraordinarily strong I think in the last press releases. Mix. It's a – I think it can have an impact, but this quarter it was favorable in Europe, and it was negative in South America. So, net-net to Ball as a whole, we're not seeing much movement one way or another. Now, there may be a quarter where I referenced a lot more positives, and there might be a quarter where I referenced a little bit more negative. So, that can have an impact. We haven't fundamentally seen it over the last couple of quarters in our results.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is let's not forget in the beginning of this pandemic, it was this much about trying to get product on the shelf. And so, the retailers played an important part of it. And so, they were trying to reduce the number of SKUs that they were loading on the shelves. So, it really was through supply chains that were working hand in hand with each other.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's super helpful. And maybe a related question to tie into kind of US imports of cans. Obviously, as you just mentioned, the market I think was a bit caught by surprise with the level of strength this year. You got a bit lucky with spare international capacity during COVID, and your customers probably paid a bit higher freight just to get any can they could. As we kind of get ready for 2021, which you assume to be another oversold year, has there been more preparation or dialogue with your customers about how to efficiently serve them with imports next year? And does that create any incremental value capture for you with that?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: That's a great question. There has been much more dialogue. It has been wonderful from that perspective. Is there more value capture? Not necessarily simply from the fact that there may be more from our customers because they're not in as much of a reactionary position as it is. We're being proactive with them, finding those pockets of additional can opportunity around the world. That's not something we're – we're helping as the industry leader getting folks in can. So, we don't necessarily view those as opportunities to margin up, if you will.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Just to give you a context. So – as you know, we have a new plant in Glendale, Arizona. We haven't had made cans yet. In fact, we're still installing equipment. We will be for the next couple months. We're already talking about building that out to the brim in terms of the bricks and mortar, and being done within 12 to 18 months of doing that. When we announced that plant, that was more of a 36-month plan to do that, and so we've accelerated because that reduces the number of imports, but as this growth continues, what we've realized is not only will we be filling out that plant but they also need those import cans. And that's what Dan has been talking about a bit, and that's why we are moving as fast as we can in terms of these new capacity startups.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details...
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Morning.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: ...and congratulation on the progress. Hey, guys, I wanted to come back to the question on the contracts. Now obviously, it is a very tight market, and your customers are coming to you because you have or will be able to provide capacity. What else are you offering in these contracts in exchange for longer term or maybe it's just availability of cans. And a question that we've asked I think it was touched on earlier on this call as well, what – I know you won't line item it for us, but what additional benefits qualitatively or just in general are you getting on contracts now relative to what you were getting say, a year or two or three ago?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, George. This is John. Maybe I'll let Dan take the second part in a minute, and I'll try and tackle the first part because you've been around this industry a long time. At the end of the day, it's surety of supply. It's what they are relying on, and in an environment where supply exceeds demand, it's very easy to cherry-pick and have annual tenders, and move your volume around because you know there's enough, excess in the system that you can play that game. When it's tight, and the outlook says it will not only continue to be tight, but perhaps get even tighter, surety of supply matters. And we've been talking about this for over two years now, in fact, probably three years from now, and it's here. And some customers decided early on that that they saw what we saw, and move forward under long-term agreements, and others didn't. And the others who didn't are the ones scrambling a bit more today. We continue to work with our customers because at the end of the day, we want the can to be growing, and we want our customers to win, because when our customers win, we win. And so, to that point, what we've been saying is we've got the surety of supply for you, it's important in today's environment, and let us work with you to make sure that you have long-term availability at your disposal. Maybe I'll turn over to Dan, and talk about the second part.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think the qualitative, this is – we're definitely hearing this in North America and to a lesser extent in South America, but who we partner with, George, and you know this is the CPG companies that are big innovators. And on the alcohol side, we're finally starting to see the large CPG companies really start to put out products that are winning in the market. And so, what I think they appreciate about our network and what we're offering is we're offering agility and flexibility for their marketing teams and for them. And that agility and flexibility is something coupled with the immediate need for surety of supply. That's a really compelling reason why you want to partner with Ball. And so, we're seeing that be an excellent path into much longer and much more strategic dialogue. And the same thing goes with our supply base.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood. Whatever it was, two years ago, three years ago, we used to talk on this call about how the alcoholic beverage companies were not really doing innovations they needed to do, and it's obviously done a full 180, and you're seeing that in your returns. Back then, it was the carbonated soft drink companies and non-alcoholic companies who were pushing innovation. I don't know if you would agree with this view or you disagree, are you seeing the CSD companies loading up the next pipeline of new products? And how – I imagine it's going to be in cans. But how do you see that playing out? And related to that, back then, call it, the 2016 Analyst Day, you talked a lot about how the can hopefully was going to create greater profit pools for your customers. If you look back over the last four years, I think it was really more of a soft drink comment. Was it successful in doing that? And in turn, does that mean leverage for more growth in cans looking out?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Why don't I jump into that because I distinctly remember it was 2016. And it was focused on soft drink, but it was also focused on beer. The can in the alcohol segment is a very profitable segment. And so, I think it's done both. And on the CSD side, I think the answer is yes. I do think you see. Now it depends by country, and depends by region. But you have seen the non-alcoholic companies use the can portfolio to differentiate and create different price points. That is abundantly clear. And I can give you plenty of different examples offline. On the alcohol side, you've seen the same thing as well. But the difference is they've also pushed new products. I think what we see today, two big trends, and I'll turn it over to Dan. Number one, there's a blurring of these lines, where it used to be alcohol companies and non-alcohol companies. And you're seeing a blurring of that. Because I think you're seeing a blurring from a consumer and a retailer perspective. And then, the second point I would say is, on the non-alcoholic side, you are continuing to see a proliferation. And just think about sparkling water, and where it was in 2016 and where it is today. It's still growing 20% a year, even pre-COVID, so. And it's accelerated from COVID, so, in all different types of sparkling water, not just flavored, but you actually have real fruit flavors in some of these types of things. And so, you are seeing, I don't know if I'd call it brand extensions, but you are seeing new products in that CSD, and you're going to continue to, along with that blurring. Dan?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think the comment that John made about some of these companies transitioning into "beverage companies". By doing that, they're able to go into a number of bigger profit pools. And what – we've stated that statistic time and time again over the last couple years about just new product launches in North America are almost exclusively going into cans. So, all of that's kind of breeding on itself. I would not characterize the innovation pipeline potentially in the CSD side as robust as maybe what we're seeing from the alcohol side right now. But part of that has to do with can supply. Candidly, we're probably – if we had more cans, I think you'd see a lot more introductions from the CSD side of the house. And I know there's one aforementioned big product launch that was called out a couple of months ago by one of the large CSD providers. And I think if that's widely successful, then, George, I think your theory may play out.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. I had more questions, but to be fair to everybody else, I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC: Yes. Hi. Firstly, I was wondering building on the previous discussion, if you can discuss a little bit about the announced capacity additions and the ones that you have not yet disclosed, what – how does your customer mix look there in terms of existing customers versus new ones, usual end markets versus new ones? I think we all expect that there's a high weight in hard seltzer and other products like that. But can you provide some more color?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Overwhelmingly, there're existing customers and existing customers with products that are winning disproportionately in the marketplace. And why I say that you can kind of mirror some of our customers' investments in filling operations, and new breweries, et cetera, those opportunities are the ones that we're having conversations with disproportionately versus new entrants. And some of those – as it relates to North America, some of those products. One, you mentioned seltzers aren't necessarily in Europe. They're not necessarily in some other parts of the world. So, they can be customers that we're dealing with that we're helping in other parts of the world potentially. Still, I would characterize...
Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC: Okay.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: ...that as an existing customer.
Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC: Yeah. And actually that was setting up for the follow-up, which is the hard seltzers haven't been such a good tailwind for your North America. How do you see the market in Europe expanding there? Can the market actually – well, do you see demand for hard seltzers in the next few years in Europe, and would it be mainly in cans you think or could we see a packaging split between cans and potentially glass?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I would say, I think this data point is quite helpful as it relates to the spiked seltzer market. Two years ago, the top two category leads in the spiked seltzer market had roughly 75% of the market share with 10 to 12 SKUs. Fast forward to today, those two category leaders still have 75%, except for there's 120 different products in the marketplace. So, I think the leaders in the market are probably the ones that lead elsewhere in the world. They have figured out how to grow, maintain their category position. And typically, what we've seen is new product introductions happen much, much faster in North America than they do in other parts of the world. So, that's how I would potentially see the seltzer market playing out. It is hard for me to believe that you're not going to be drinking beer in Austria and Germany, but who knows.
Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC: Okay. Perfect. And a very quick one on the aluminum can production. You mentioned that the new plant in Rome, Georgia is up and running. I'm just wondering how is the manufacturing process and the startup going so far. Is it as efficient as you expected?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: We're not yet running. We believe that we will be running here at the end of the year, heading into 2021. Every indication, though, every step of the way on the startup, on the testing of the equipment, it's all in line with what we expected. And there's no reason to believe that we won't be exiting next year at kind of the annualized run rate that we anticipate in our business case.
Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Hope all is well. Curious about the capacity additions and line additions that you talked about in Europe specifically. Maybe I missed it, I don't recall you guys kind of calling that out before. But a couple of your other competitors have talked about maybe the market not being as attractive, and probably throttling back maybe capital or just in a holding pattern until returns get a little bit better. I know we can't paint Europe with a broad brush, but just curious what you're seeing that's different maybe from some of your competitors?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think, it's your very last comment, you can't paint with it a broad brush. Where we're investing, we like the economic profile and the returns. UK, from that perspective, it's a huge tailwind on sustainability. Similar in many instances in Russia, and a very difficult place to do business. So, we've already got a great team and a great footprint there. So, we've been able to benefit with the growth in that marketplace. And then, other pockets where it's made sense for us to expand, expand quickly at good EVA returns, we're taking advantage of that. But yeah, I would say, look, I mean, if you characterize the investments, and look at what we've called off, we're investing more in North America, to a lesser extent in South America and Europe. But it's not as a result of you can't find really good business opportunities there.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, Dan. And I guess the last one would be on what you guys talked about at the Investor Day, the source, I mean other than kind of outside perspective over being an ordering platform that maybe is more open, more robust than what you had before. Any early wins that you can talk about, and maybe, Dan, this plays into what you talked about kind of sharpening the pencil with more statistical data to go about M&R and other things?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I would say in earlier conversation on this call, it's like having data at your fingertips to work across all of our regions to try to keep folks in cans, having one set of the truth, if you will, to respond in a quicker fashion, those have been the most important early wins. We're still at the early outset. There's an awful lot you can do with these tools as you can imagine. So, right now, as opposed to embarking on more in terms of module adaptation, it's a key, as John said, surety of supply is everything right now, so we're really focused on those aspects of the tool.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And to make the customer experience better.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Dimitra, we...
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: ...have time for one more – yeah, thank you. Dimitra, we have time for one more question, if there is one.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Good morning. I'll try to keep this short. I wondered, Dan Fisher, if you can just to give us a general sense with the new contracts that are being put in place, what are the elements of uncertainty with those contracts for Ball? I mean, are you locked up for 100% of the volume? Or what are the things that you don't know going forward about the business around those contracts?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Good point. With what we characterize today, and when I talked about on this phone call, those are all anchored with long-term contracts. And we understand very well what the products are. There's a home forum. And probably for the next year when we talk about any investment, you're talking about simply moving import cans into domestic can production. So, not a lot of risk, not a lot of unknowns. And yeah, you can characterize it as a pretty rigid set of terms in terms of forecasting even production runs, even deliveries throughout the year with these anchor tenants.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. All right. And then, just one other one on the new capacity. Just the challenges for either the equipment suppliers or Ball as you think about adding all this capacity in a fairly short period of time?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. If you remember, our biggest concern, it hasn't been the supply chain because we've been big believers of the growth and the sustainability message for several years now. So, we ensured that we got out ahead of a number of those from a supply chain standpoint, metal, coatings, all of the things that you can control with your supply base. The biggest challenge and the biggest question mark we had, and I know John and Scott have echoed these as well, is can we hire the people with the appropriate skill mix at the right time, get them trained and start up in line with our expectations and our customers. And I have really been blown away by all of our cross-functional teams that have figured out a way to hire over 1,250 people thus far this year. So, that has been a terrific win for us, and that has largely de-risked a lot of our projects at this point.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: So, you're not running into anything just with the equipment suppliers themselves being kind of overloaded or backlogged?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: No. We're keeping our eye on it. There are certain pieces of equipment that – yeah, there's potential for things to move out. And I give our engineering and our procurement organization a lot of credit. We have been managing that, managing the supply chain, doing what we need to make sure that we're candidly maybe a little further ahead on the prioritization list. So, not right now. But at the rate we continue to see these things grow, we're all going to have to be investing at a similar pace.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Sounds good. That's it from me.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, Dimitra. Well, I want to thank you all for your participation. As always, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to Ann Scott, and she'd be happy to address them as appropriate. Everyone, have a good and safe holiday season, and we look forward to talking to you early next year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you, all, for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation 2Q 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, Aug 6, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2020 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release financials include descriptions of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other non-reportable segments. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance and trends. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses, as well as our outlook for the company. Second quarter results were strong and candidly came in stronger than we expected, which is just another proof point of the long-term resiliency of our various businesses. At a time that the world experienced the worst economic and social crises in our lifetimes, our second quarter and year to date comparable diluted earnings per share increased 2% and 12% respectively. And we're driven by our North and Central American beverage business, where improved commercial terms at are manufacturing performance, increased volumes in the absence of metal scrap headwinds all contributed to a very strong quarter. Dan Fisher will elaborate more on our other beverage segments in a moment. But over the course of this quarter sequential monthly improvement in each of our packaging segments improved from the lows we experienced in late May and early April. North American beverage can demand continues to outstrip supply. And despite the initial pandemic related demand impact in Europe and South America, demand in these regions has accelerated meaningfully since these regions began to reopen in mid-May. And our beverage can business in each region is sold out in advance of new capacity coming online. We are encouraged by the start-ups of our new lines in Fort Worth, Texas and Rome, Georgia. And the rest of our growth projects around the world remain in good shape. During the quarter global beverage volumes were down 3% with low single digit growth in North America, unable to offset weak volumes in April and to a lesser extent, May in both South America and EMEA. However, we did experience much stronger year over year growth in the month of June, about which Dan will elaborate more later. In our aerospace business we continue to see strong growth with quarterly year over year revenues up 16% and our won-not-booked backlog of 10% since first quarter 2020. We did experience however, a $13 million reserve for the failure of a key subcontractor component and a large classified program that more than offset an otherwise strong quarter. We expect this to be a onetime event and believe our supplier and our program team have the issue isolated and under control. Other highlights in the quarter include. Our aluminum aerosol business was down slightly for the quarter after customers took anticipated downtime and increased demand for sanitizing sprays were unable to offset lower demand for deodorants. We continue to make progress on our aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. Construction and hiring for our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility remains on track. Despite the current fan attendance restrictions at major sporting, music and other events, our outlook for 2021 is perhaps even a bit stronger than when we began the year as we have accelerated our retail go-to-market strategy with a signing of a number of various letters of intent, executed with both retail partners as well as venue operators. Starting this fall, consumers will be able to purchase our cups on major online platforms, which will then feed into more presence in the physical stores as our production capabilities ramp up towards the end of this year. During the quarter, we announced our national partnerships with Acosta and Blue Ocean, thereby positioning the Ball aluminum cup for retail success. Across our businesses year-to-date, we've hired over 1000 new employees and invested approximately $450 million in growth projects that we and our investors will enjoy in the years ahead. Now before I turn it over to Dan and Scott, I do want to give a big shout out to all of our colleagues here at Ball for caring for one another and for living our culture. Your dedication and hard work to support our customers, our communities and the global economies where we operate is second to none. And true Ball fashion throughout this crisis, our company and employees have provided millions of dollars of financial support over 300 organizations in the local communities in which we live and operate. At the same time, these same people were able to continue to execute successfully our strategy, grow our business, control the things we can control, and invest in our future. So a big thank you. In summary, Ball has adapted well to this new environment. Despite contractions in some of our markets early in the quarter, we exit the quarter with good momentum and are excited to bring additional capacity online as quickly and safely as possible and continue to believe that the overall strength of our businesses will allow us to grow operating earnings in the second half of this year and beyond. We also want to extend our well wishes to everyone, our customers, our suppliers, our first responders, our governments, and indeed all of our stakeholders who are persevering through all of this and we wish all of you listening for your continued safety and good health. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. I also want to thank our employees, customers and supply chain for their collaboration to maintain our industry's ability to serve consumer demand. In addition, our HR leadership and our environmental health and safety professionals continue to keep our Ball family safe and vigilant about our well-being as communities. Offices and schools began to open up. Looking forward, and given the increasing demand for sustainable aluminum packaging, it is going to be an exciting beverage can market for the next several years. To bolster the growing demand for aluminum packaging and true circularity we recently published our peer reviewed lifecycle assessments and biennial sustainability report. Visit ball.com/sustainability, to learn more about what Ball is doing to advance the circular economy in its operations and across our industries, while also supporting diversity and inclusion initiatives. As we discussed on the first quarter call consumer behavior varies by region. In North America, consumers are able to access multiple shopping channels, stock up and store bulk packages of our products. In late-March, this led to a surge in beverage can demand as those occasions that occurred in the on-premise and convenience channels shifted to the at home or off-premise channels. Following March volumes being up 12% April slowed a bit, then returned to single-digit growth in May and June. Demand is continuing to outpace supply and inventory levels are low. In particular, year-to-date through July, we have seen IRI can demand in the non-alcoholic category growing 11% domestic beer of 4% that includes up 13% in the second quarter, craft growth of 20% and FMBs up in the range of 80% to 90%. As we look forward, we're thankful that our new line and Fort Worth started up a couple weeks ago, and that our new Rome, Georgia beverage can line is on track to start up next week. In advance to those lines and our two new plants coming online in early 2021 for Glendale, Arizona, and in mid-2021 for our Northeastern plant, our global plant network outside of the U.S. will supply additional cans when possible. For the full year, we anticipate North America beverage can growth of at least 4% with half of that growth coming from inventory, drawdown and imports. In EMEA segment volume was down nearly 8% for the quarter as borders remained closed. Tourism was restricted, and shopping hours were limited across many countries through much of the quarter. During the quarter, strength in the U.K. and Russia were unable to offset softer demand in southern Europe, Egypt and Turkey. Across Ball’s EMEA business demand trends improved late in the quarter with April volumes down 11%, May volumes down 16% and then June volumes up 4%. This positive momentum continued into July with volumes up mid-single digits. Additional capital projects across Europe continued and we foresee European beverage can volumes up low single digits in 2020. In South America, after seeing a nearly 60% decrease in Brazilian can shipments in April due to the temporary closing of smaller grocery stores, gas stations and convenience stores. Our demand rebounded sharply up 7% in May, and the progress continued in June with volumes up nearly 40%. Beverage cans have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates. Exiting the second quarter package, mix for beer on the shelf was 70% cans versus array of 50% at the end of the first quarter 2020. Following discussions with customers we anticipate can mix on the shelf remaining high beyond 2020. And we intend to move forward with previously discussed line additions in Brazil. From a segment operating performance perspective, Ball's North American segment earnings were up 34% more equitable customer contracts, operational improvements and volume growth benefited the quarter. Partially offsetting this, were hiring costs associated with the new manufacturing lines ramping up in the second half of 2020 and unfavorable mix associated with certain can sizes sold through the convenience store channel. Our initial plans to add 6 billion units of capacity in our North American business by the end of 2021 have been adjusted upward following recent contract discussions. We proceed fully scaling out our new facilities in Arizona and in the Northeastern US sooner rather than later. As of today, our capital growth projects are on track and earnings growth is expected to continue across North America in 2020 and beyond. In our EMEA segment, negative demand trends resulting from the pandemic, lower absorption and FX headwinds pressured segment results for the quarter. Our EMEA teams’ close to a customer approach and support from our North American business positions the business for strong second half performance. Turning to South American segment, second quarter earnings were down primarily driven by the abrupt contraction in Brazilian demand early in the first half of the quarter, which led to lower absorption over multiple weeks. Similar to our EMEA segments, our teams’ close to our customers approach will bolster second half results. In our other non-reportable results, the company's Myanmar, Indian and Saudi beverage can manufacturing results continue to be dampened by production downtime. In addition, other includes an annual 20 million P&L investment to stand up our aluminum cup business. As John referenced earlier, we are on track with our aluminum cup plant construction, and our push into retail is ticking up steam. In summary, global beverage can demand was very resilient during the second quarter and momentum is building for the third quarter and beyond. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. 2020 has provided us all with unprecedented challenges and you've risen to the occasion time and time again. Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up and stay safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable second quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.65 versus $0.64 in 2019. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong North America beverage segment results a lower share count and lower corporate costs offset by lower EMEA, South America and aerospace results due to the short-term demand and supply chain impacts. Due to the pass through of lower aluminum costs and the 2019 sale of the Argentine steel aerosol business and Chinese beverage can assets and lower second quarter packaging demand outside of North America. Revenues for the second quarter were down. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and we have focused near term on maintaining ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. Year-to-date, we experienced our seasonal working capital build which was more sizeable than typical, due largely to the timing of metal payments. As a result of this timing and ongoing growth initiatives in raw materials supplied to support them, we anticipate the full year 2020 working capital investment to be used in the range of $300 million, which is slightly higher than previously anticipated due to accelerating growth conditions. As we sit here today some additional key metrics to keep in mind. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 18%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million and full year corporate undistributed cost recorded and other non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $55 million. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be strong. We will be investing in working capital and even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity, while also completing construction on our first aluminum cups manufacturing facility. Contrary to past sizeable M&A deals, Ball is embarking on a multiyear phase of internal investments to serve organic growth for beverage cans, and support new contracted volumes. At this point, 2020 CapEx will likely exceed $900 million and 2020 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Ball has always been focused on being good stewards of our cash and prudently balancing real time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our strong cash flow, we are managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively and consistently returning value to our long-term shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aluminum aerosol business saw global volumes in the quarter decline 6% driven primarily by flat volumes in North America, single digit declines in Europe and strong double-digit declines in India as a result of multi-week country lockdowns and regional fillers downtime. Looking ahead, we're excited to expand our aluminum aerosol business’s geographic reach into South America and expect the acquisition of the Tubex facility to close in the third quarter. Our aerospace business reported approximately 16% revenue growth and lower than expected segment earnings due to its supply chain issue on a key fixed price project. Adjustments to testing schedules have been made, and the items necessary from the supplier are forthcoming. The team has done a good job managing the process with our customers despite difficult circumstances. Looking ahead, the growth trajectory of this business is even stronger, with won-not-booked backlog reaching $5.3 billion. In addition, our year-to-date aerospace headcount has increased by nearly 450 employees, and we anticipate hiring an additional 550 employees by year-end. Our HR team has done a great job onboarding these new employees and running our summer internship program remotely. In this business, we continue to enhance our infrastructure, build out testing and manufacturing facilities in 2020 and ensure all projects are on track and on budget. Current indications reflect that the business will be able to grow profitably in excess of 15% per year over the next several years given the scale and type of recent contract wins. In summary, Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global aluminum, packaging and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders. As we sit here today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share in 2020 is higher than previously thought. Our teams will do everything possible to outperform while being keenly focused on working safely and executing capital investments. Beyond 2020 we look forward to driving our business to deliver long term diluted earnings per share growth of at least 10% to 15% and achieve our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year on our growing invested capital base. Especially during these times we're thankful for one another and the opportunities in front of Ball for an even brighter future. Lastly as a reminder Ball will host its Bi-Annual Investor Day on October 6th. We look forward to your attendance at this virtual events. And with that, Kelly, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. You may proceed with your question.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: I think you indicated you’re sold out in all your major regions exiting the quarter. And I'm wondering if it's possible to quantify maybe how much volume you may have left on the table, either in 2Q or potentially for the year. And then just a related question. Is it possible to say what quantity of cans you might export-import cross region in 2020?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think it's difficult to answer what did we leave on the table. I think clearly in Europe, negative, almost 8% growth that should have been in the 3% to 5% growth range. So I would steer you in that direction. And then for South America, again, we should have probably grown in the mid to high single digits for the quarter. And we were obviously a little shy due to the April decline. We're probably importing in terms of it's all North America support, I would expect for the year somewhere in the neighborhood of a 2 billion cans. One billion of that is coming from places that typically wouldn't be shipping from, Europe, India, Brazil, for instance. And then where we can get some relief and we benefited from that in the second quarter, specifically in Mexico, as kind of the brewery industry was deemed non-essential. We were able to use some of our excess capacity in Mexico to ship up. So that's sort of how I would frame where those imports are coming from.
John Hayes: Yes, but Anthony, and how many would we have been able to sell if we had capacity? That's a tough question to answer. We don't know. We -- Dan pointed out when you leave, here some of those IRI statistics and just in the second quarter alone, when you had carbonated soft drink cans, up 14%, big beer cans up 14%, total FMBs up nearly 150%. Those are very big categories and very strong. We obviously are not able to keep up with that because we had not anticipated that. And so our -- as Dan had mentioned our inventories are at all-time lows. We've been importing as many cans as possible. I know that doesn't answer your question, how many were left on the table. Because it just -- it's too difficult to know. What I do believe, though, it underpins many of these longer-term investments, because the growth we're seeing. Yes, some of it has to do with the stay at home rules, but a lot of it still has to do with sustainability that we've talked about over the past couple of years.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then you talked about some benefits from new contractual terms, and I'm wondering if it's possible to put any finer point on the contribution from that. Does that roll through over a number of years, if these are multiyear contracts? And understanding, you're probably limited in what you can say. Can you give any color in terms of how these terms are different than maybe conventional or legacy contracts?
John Hayes: This has been well described in the past. And I'm not going to say other than what we talked about. We normally don't talk about these things. But we did have a number of contracts renew at the end of 2019. And we had told people that the phasing on some of these new commercial terms would probably be multi-year. It's not just one year. And so that's about all we can say right now.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Neel Kumar: Great, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned fully scaling out the North American capacity additions in Arizona and Northeastern U.S. Can you just give us a sense of how much incremental capacity is expected to be added in North America versus the six million units that was initially planned? How do you think about the ramp in this capacity from the start-up of the facilities in mid-2021?
Dan Fisher: Yes, it's all going to be dependent on executing contractual negotiations and we will continue to update that number for you as those things become more firm. And it's clearly reliant on execution, hiring employees and ramping up lines. But got to have contracts on the back of it and some of those contract negotiations are still ongoing.
John Hayes: But the two new facilities were built. And remember, we're scaling them that they have the capability of being the biggest in our system.
Neel Kumar: Okay, that's helpful. And then we recently saw an announcement that a new-entrant coming into the U.S. market. What impact any of you see two market dynamics from the announcement? And what level of demand growth you think is necessary over the next several years in the North American market, for it to remain, basically balanced, given all the new industry capacity that's been brought on?
John Hayes: Yes, we've talked about this in the past. And the long story short is, let's put this in context. The market is approximately 100 billion cans. We've been -- realistically this year, it's been growing well above the 4% to 6% we talked about. Whether it's been 8 or 10, it's unclear because we have left cans on the table as we were talking a few minutes ago. So, you're talking about upwards of 8 billion to 10 billion incremental cans in one year alone. Now this is a unique year. I get that. But we think as we go forward that 4% to 6%, based on what we see it's trending to the upper part of that range. So, that's in the range of approximately 6 billion cans a year. That's why we're accelerating our growth investments. And as we've discussed previously, this is a growing business. This is a scale business and this is a business if you run it right, you can generate decent economic returns. And so I'm not surprised people have been looking at it. But I think the overall market is more than -- the growth of the overall market is more than sufficient to absorb this capacity. And as a result, given our 20 plus plant network, we have many levers that we can pull relative to any other smaller competitors that just have one or two levers to pull.
Neel Kumar: Thanks. That’s helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to piggyback on some of the questions from Neel and from Anthony to extent possible. Again, recognizing you're not going to be able to really quantify or maybe even enumerate, can you talk to whether with your customers in North America or anywhere else, given what they're seeing in terms of demand, and your need to supply more capacity or being willing to accept more creative terms, different terms and maybe what was even put into contracts and '19, any desire or willingness to maybe sharing some of the risks and costs to make sure that capacity is on the ground, when the demand is there anything that you can talk to on that question?
John Hayes: Yes, I believe that is an accurate depiction of where we are right now. There are a number of categories and a few customers, George, that are viewing this as a real opportunity to grow for the first time in years. And those customers and those categories are being aggressive. They want to move quickly. And yes, we are having any number of much more creative discussions with those folks. It's not everyone, but certainly you can imagine in the seltzer categories and when you see big beer and non-alcoholic categories growing at this rate that's a real opportunity for some of our customers to step into some growth profiles that they haven't seen in a while, and they're using the can and innovative packs to do that. And yes, different dialogues are certainly happening right now as a result. And George just to give you an example, we've talked about this in the past, but historically, at least in North America, many of these larger contracts are based on requirements that you'd have to fulfill 100% of the requirements of any given filling location. And over the last couple of years, we've re-jiggered that, because all the risk was then on us to the upside and the downside, quite honestly. So what we've re-jiggered that as think of it more of a fixed amount plus or minus window, call it a 5% window, 10% window, whatever is agreed to. And they've got to take those cans, and if they need more cans, then it's a separate discussion. And so the most important thing we're trying to do though, is make sure we can fulfill as much of the can demand our customers are seeing. And I think because of COVID it caught everyone off guard a little bit. People knew the growth. We've been talking about this growth for several years and there were some customers that were more understanding of it than others. But I think this overall shift of premise has been a great help for us. But it's also pointed out the fact that making sure that you have your supply chains in good order are important. So we're trying to keep up with our customers as best we can.
George Staphos: Okay, thanks for that guys. Two questions and I’ll turn it over. To the extent that the capital spending has continued to move higher, I mean we understand logic why, because of the demand that you see that you're trying to meet. Is there a way to I don't know quantify or qualitatively talk about return you expect to get on what these incremental spending numbers look like relative to what had been perhaps the base capital spending few years ago or whatever $500 million $600 million? And then on aerospace and correct my number there if it's wrong on what the base number had been. And then on aerospace if you could talk a bit further, I realize it was a project in the black. But can you talk a bit about what the issue was in terms of the subcontractor? Why you believe it's resolved and should we expect the earnings for aerospace to continue and what had been the trajectory you were expecting third quarter and beyond? Thank you, guys, good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Yeah George, let me take the first part on the returns and then I’ll turn it over to John on the aerospace one. We are still first and foremost an EVA company so any capital we’ll put in the work; we have to get 9% over within the first three years of putting that capital to work. These projects are better than average because they tend to be a higher percentage of specialty cans than standard containers. So we're going to like to returns on these projects over the course of the next several years. And so I would say, our return profile’s gotten better and compounded with the growth that we're seeing. So I think we're in a pretty good place and frankly spending $900 million, the faster we can get some of these assets up and running, the faster we can enjoy the returns on.
John Hayes: And George with respect to aerospace, we had a test failure of a key component from one of our sub-suppliers. It was late in the program's life. As you know that when you're building a program like this you assemble everything and at the tail end, you test everything. Well we had a failure of one of the key components there which pushed out the delivery date and therefore costs us money related to re-working the problem and getting a new part from the supplier as well as our marching army cost if you want to call it that, keeping the program team intact and moving it out in this case approximately six months or so. As I said in the prepared remarks, this was a one-time event. This is very few times the things like this happen but they do happen from time to time. But I think both our supplier as well as our program team have the issue isolated and under control. So even despite that, you would see even with that they had a pretty good quarter but without that they had a very good quarter and we expect, as I said as we march forward to have 15% or more earnings growth in that business.
George Staphos: All right. Thank you, guys, good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. You may proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to ask first off about Europe. Maybe you can just provide your thoughts on the business there, obviously is slightly different situation as far as the opportunity for pantry loading. So how are you thinking about kind of Europe global -- Europe, can volume in the second half as well as next year?
Dan Fisher: Yeah. We think that in the prepared comments we exited June as border started to open up and as folks were able to get out of their house, can consumption picked up and we were on the growth trajectory exiting June year over year. And we expect that to continue to build at this rate obviously, have to preface that with we don't know what's going to happen second wave of COVID etcetera. But right now, we're anticipating to end the year despite being down 8% in the second quarter with slight growth for the year. And that means that the second half has to be up fairly appreciably in the mid to high single digits.
John Hayes: You know, it's interesting, this might be helpful. These are for the second quarter. In beer in Europe, this is across Europe, beer cans grew 10%, but soft drink was down 17%. Soft drink is bigger. And it makes a lot of sense when you think about it, because all the pubs were closed, but people still drink beer. So they're drinking more beer at home. But much of the soft drink in cans is actually sold in the -- on the go convenience channels, whether it's a kiosk at beach or somewhere else like that, with all of those closed we saw a retrenchment there. And those are the types of things that are now opening up that Dan was referring to.
Arun Viswanathan: That's helpful. Thanks, John. And I guess maybe we can just ask a related question here. So have you thought about anything about changing consumption habits? It seems that as people are returning to on-premise consumption, looks like bars may be more up to hold bottles and cans rather than kegs just in -- because they're not sure what their take rates are going to be. So, I guess does that affect your business? And then similarly, you had talked a little bit about the new beverages going into cans moving from 35% several years ago, maybe to 70% a year ago. Have you seen continued growth in that trajectory? And, maybe you can just offer your thoughts longer term, just on new categories in beverage cans as well as maybe changing consumption habits amongst customers? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Sure. Yeah. For the first part, this is when I really wish I had a sociology degree so I could really capture the changing behaviors and consumption patterns. But it is clear in conversation with a number of our customers that they believe that cans will certainly be least in the medium-term, a beneficiary of everything that's happening in the -- as it relates to folks working from home more. And those areas and how you -- in your dining, the food service experience, all of that tends to lead itself to more packaged products and more cans. So that -- and from there, we think that there's even potentially some upside on the growth rates that we shared six months ago. That's early indications. I think a lot of our customers are still working through what all of that means specifically, but at a 30,000 foot level, it certainly lends itself to more cans and more packaged goods. We are continuing to see, in your second question, we're continuing to see cans winning. I referenced what was happening in South America that was a substantial increase in pack mix in the beer category. But continue to see growth and movement into cans in North America, kind of North of that 70% rate. And I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. The innovations that we're hearing, the brands that are getting pushed in the cans, that rate seems to have some teeth to it, some staying power. And I could see it continuing to tick up modestly here over the next three to five years.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi, guys. Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: So John, back to your favorite topic on North American capacity additions. If we total up the announcements by you and your peer groups over the next couple of years or so. It looks like capacity will be added in the mid-teens in terms of units up 100 billion base. And obviously, the industry is seeing very strong growth at current. But can you just give us a sense for how long the contracts typically are from a duration standpoint, specific to the new capacity you as the industry leader are kind of bringing on at this point?
John Hayes: It's, every customer and every conversation is different. But what I would say is, there's a tendency for us to think more long-term about these things because that's what we've always done. You followed us a very long time and I reflect back and the things we did in South America, when we were building new plants. That mindset is what kind of what we're doing here. So it's a long way out. Also remember that number you cited, that's not going to be all in place at one time. These are all ramp ups and they start over time. So, I wouldn't disagree with your number, but that's probably over the next three years type of number. And when you see the growth -- one of the things I think about is that even enough. I could make a very compelling argument right now, given the growth rates we're seeing that that will create a shortage in the can market in 2022, or 2023, as well. So it's a very dynamic environment right now. And we're very focused on making sure we're doing the right thing for the long term for our company and our shareholders and our customers.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks for that perspective. And then second question on the beverage packaging segment for North America, North and Central America, I should say. Can you help us with the operating profit bridge between 2Q of this year versus last year? Were there any temporary savings that perhaps in play to that margin that could reverse as business normalizes, or is that not the case?
Dan Fisher: Well, the absence of the scrap that we had last year, but the business is operating better. The manufacturing performance is better. We're making every can that we can possibly sell. So absorption is good. But beyond that there's nothing that's that unusual year-over-year. I would say the scrap is probably the biggest absorption.
John Hayes: Yeah, Ghansham, remember, at the beginning of this year, we talked about the bridge year-over-year and we talked about. We needed -- where we're going to have the commercial terms, the benefits of new commercial terms. We talked about we needed to execute better. We talked about the absence of scrap, but then we also talked about headwinds related to startup costs of all those new things. All of those in general are happening as we anticipated. The only surprise to the positive in my mind is the operating performance is actually better. We are ahead of our plans for 2020. I think our manufacturing folks are doing a very good job. They've got a ton on their plate too. Because given the tightness of the market and then with all this new capital coming on, they're being spread stretched pretty thin. But despite that, they're performing candidly better than we expected.
Dan Fisher: What more startup in the back half of the year as these other plants are getting closer to fruition to. So I wouldn't take the second quarter as being kind of a normalized number. It was exceptionally good.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Mike Leithead: Great, thanks, guys. Good morning. Two on the imported cans in North America. You mentioned in the release about needing to ship cans in from Europe, which I can imagine isn't cheap. So I guess first, I know contract pricing is annual, so does that incremental cost fall on Ball or its customers? And second, how do you think this evolves as we head into '21 versus this year? Because I assume as you're starting up plants here in the U.S., you can get cans to customers for cheaper while transferring some of that value hopefully to your own P&L.
Dan Fisher: Yeah, the first part of your question is, I mean, essentially what we're doing is we're allowing the customer to take product at the facility. And they're basically on the hook for the trade. So we're not exposed on that. And as John referenced, we're stepping away with an awful lot of our contracts away from requirement contracts to more fixed volume. And then as a result of that, you're not on the hook for getting those cans shipped and absorbing the cost. It's a much more equitable contract and relationship. And right now, as you can imagine for the folks that don't have a revenue stream on premise. They're trying to buttress their revenue stream with product off premise. And they are happy to pay for that additional cost. Moving forward, this is the real -- the real challenge for us is when we look at our IRI data. We believe that the growth that we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date that still has some teeth regardless of whether we're in a COVID environment or not, sustainability continues to drive, new product launches and cans continue to drive that growth profile. And I think as the previous question was centered around a lot of capacity is going to be coming online. But as we all know, it's all related to how effectively you get it put up. And how you execute against those startup curves. And so for the next two to three years long story short, I think there will be a continued reliance on some level of imports, probably not to the extent we've seen this year, but 2021 is shaping up to be incredibly tight again. And I think you'll hear more reference to import cans at least for the next 12 to 18 months. Beyond that we'll have to -- we'll have to see.
Mike Leithead: Great, that was helpful. And then just one on the aluminum cups, particularly as you're shifting it more into a retail focus right now. Can you talk about the potential price point for your cups relative to a standard solo cup? And I'm assuming both you and your retail partners have done a bunch of consumer market analysis as you're preparing for this launch? So can you just talk about what your observations so far have been and their excitement around the product?
John Hayes: Yeah, why don't I take a first stab and then let Dan chime in. Just let me take a step back to because it's important to remember. Our strategy all along was kind of getting to the venues first create awareness and then follow-up through the retail because that's where the size of the prize is really on the retail side. The bad news is because of COVID, many of those venues were shut down. The good news is we did a tremendous amount of research and testing and we realized that the awareness is already there. In fact, many people when they have already seen them are very well versed of its attributes and its positive attributes. So as we go to the retail channels and sell it, there's two observations I’d point out. Observation number one is, we don't have to quote sell it, because we can feel the demand being there. And number two, I don't think it's as much of a relative to a plastic cup as we thought it was. This is a whole new product with a whole different proposition. And as a result, a whole different price point. And so I'm not going to get into right now about what the various price points are. You will see them in the near future when you see them on the shelf, but they are going to be a premium to what's out there today because consumers have told us they're willing to pay a premium for this product.
Dan Fisher: Some of the more specific conversations we've had in and around the cup that may help you at least on the retail side is almost universally the folks we're talking to view this as innovation and that in and of itself creates a very different discussion and dialogue in terms of the process to get it in the store, to get it on the shelf and the price point. And they're leaning, in many instances, these retailers are leaning on a lot of the research we've done to look to us to what the appropriate price is. So that's been very favorable. And the other thing that's been really exciting is some of the larger retailers have a real focus on reducing their plastic in store, and this is a wonderful opportunity for them to do that. And so those are the learnings, the biggest learnings and the biggest takeaways that might allow you to have a little perspective on maybe the success we may be having or are gearing up for as it relates to that product. The other thing, we're doing more and more and you'll see it as we go through 2020. But particularly in 2021 is more on the marketing side as well, creating awareness for this. I give our [indiscernible] Dan, the rest of his team a tremendous amount of credit. We're being very creative things that candidly we haven't done in the past, but creating awareness for that that's going to actually help maintain the price position we’re aiming for.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Brian Maguire: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just put it up better understand the raise CapEx. Look, I don't think you were announcing any new lines or new locations or capacity with it. So is it just simply pulling forward some of the investments you would have otherwise made next year? And then as we think about looking into 2021, should we expect CapEx to decline meaningfully? And related to that the working capital build this year? Do you have any initial thoughts on where working capital might go next year more investments to support the growth or do you see it flattening out a little bit?
John Hayes: I think the pace of CapEx is really pulling forward as much as we can, because we see the demand is there now as Dan talked about being short can. So the faster we can get these assets up and running, the better. So some of that is pull forward. I think as you look into next year, I think these growth percentages, if they're going to continue at this kind of pace. We'll probably spend more capital than what we had originally anticipated in 2021. But we're also making a lot more money. On the working capital front, the growth from where I said previously for this year is due to that acceleration of the growth. I think next year it'll stabilize somewhat. But I could still see a small use of working capital next year, but it's too early to tell.
Scott Morrison: And Brian, the only thing I'd add to that is, well, on one hand, we didn't announce any new capital. In fact, we did, because what Dan said was, we are going to accelerate the build out the ultimate build out of our plants in Arizona and Northeast U.S.
Brian Maguire: Okay, so to interpret that initially there were a certain number of lines and then…
John Hayes: Correct.
Brian Maguire: Potential room to build more lines, and we're going to have those second phase plans at this point?
John Hayes: That's correct.
Brian Maguire: Makes sense. Just one additional question, if I could. Was there any impact on the U.S. margins from mix in the quarter? I know you talked about some shipping maybe the more the club stores in the multi packs does that have a material impact on mix. And then any thoughts on restarting the share repurchase program now that seems like the macro is kind of lifted a little bit of the thought for your ability to forecast the business.
Dan Fisher: I'll take the first part of those questions. It wasn't a material impact. But yes, we did have some dampening of margins because the convenience store channels with a higher specialty mix and higher price points for our customers. That was down a bit, especially in April and the first part of May. Not entirely sure that's all going to come back, just depending on return to work, at least for the next six months. And what folks are going to do in the U.S., the less frequently you’re driving, the less frequently you're stopping in and a convenience channel. And that was certainly a difference in terms of behavior pattern that dampened in our mix a bit in the second quarter.
Scott Morrison: Then on the share buyback front, we're going to continue to return significant value to shareholders with over $200 million in dividends this year. We bought some stock earlier in the year. And we'll see how the year progresses and are not ruling out buying some shares in the back half of the year.
Brian Maguire: Great, thanks very much.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ing with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually John dialing in on for Phil. How are you guys doing?
John Hayes: Good.
Unidentified Analyst: Congrats on the strong performance. I just had one question, I guess related to some of Dan's comments on packs mix shift. Particularly you had noted the shift in grocery. I think you said 50% beer was in cans in 1Q and then it moved to 70% this quarter. I was just hoping you could talk about, kind of what caused that, was that mostly driven by people not wanting to go to the stores and get a reusable glass bottle. And what you think is the actual stickiness in the longer term for picking up that share of the shelf. And then in the release they've also talked about an acceleration of substrate mix towards cans in EMEA. Maybe you can also discuss what's driving that and how that is going to be held on to it in the longer term as well.
Dan Fisher: Sure. The first part of your question as relates to South America. There's a couple of things that you certainly have to pay attention. One we've seen for the last, I would say, three to five years has been the reluctance by the smaller retailers. And it's all throughout South America to carry returnable glass, the perishable nature of it. They don't have a lot of square footage. Buying behavior in those areas is smaller stores, its gas stations, it's much more in convenience channel. And those retailers are demanding cans. And so that has been certainly -- I would continue to see that moving forward. The other part is, lot of these South American markets, there's a dominant returnable glass player. And when they make a conscious decision or when they're losing share to cans, at some point in all the markets that we're participating in, they will make a conscious decision to move into cans. And I think the combination of those two things have happened in Brazil, and I would suspect that that would continue for the foreseeable future.
Unidentified Analyst: And do you just think that was also accelerated because of the pandemic, the users don't want to hold.
Dan Fisher: Absolutely.
Unidentified Analyst: On that actual returnable graph and now the big shift, particularly in 1Q outside of obviously the trend that you've been seeing for a while.
Dan Fisher: Yeah, when the on-premise is closed, the incumbent that is relying on returnable glass, they either fight with cans or they lose in share. And I would suspect that they have made such a conscious effort on that front and the retail movement is a lot bigger of an issue I think than what a lot of people have discussed previously. So I think that’s sort of here to stay, whether it's 70% this quarter or 65% next, it's appreciably going to be higher moving forward. Yeah in Europe, I think we're seeing as John referenced, we’re seeing and we will continue to see is pubs and on-premise is less and less open. There’ll be more cans pushed. And typically I think because of the sustainable nature of the package and I spoke to move into filling those cans. And if they have success with that, I think it'll be a boon to what level and what extent in the medium and long term that's yet to be determined. But it I would certainly assume that it will be a lift for us moving forward.
John Hayes: Yeah. And just to put a finer point on that, on the beer side in Europe that's not -- it hasn't been the issue at all. It's really been on the soft drinks, the non-alcoholic and without going into any particular names, whether it's energy, whether it's soft drink, because those are typically sold in the immediate consumption channel that's what's been soft. It's gotten better. But it will continue to be soft just because the tourist trade in Europe is down year-over-year this summer for the reasons we all know.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood, thank you and good luck in the quarter.
Dan Fisher: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. You may proceed with your question.
Mark Wilde: Thanks, I've got just a couple of them real quickly. Can you talk about any bottlenecks that you may be encountering either from co-vendor from just equipment suppliers being scratched as you ramp up, because there are a lot of can projects around the world? And the other one, John, we've seen some different numbers out there for kind of recycling and recovering rates on aluminum beverage cans. And I wondered if you could just share your perspective on those rates in the different regions around the world.
John Hayes: Yeah, so let me try to quickly take both of them and maybe Dan can chime in. Let me talk about not only just beverage can, let me talk aerospace as well. All of our projects, our folks have done a herculean job to make sure that they're all on track. There's a couple of Europe that we slowed down. There's one in particular down Brazil that we consciously slowed down, just because the volatility of those markets we restarted them up. But kudos to our folks here in North America, whether it’s that cups filled out, whether it's Fort Worth, whether it's room, whether it's all the building we're doing up or we are here in aerospace, all of them have been doing extremely well. And that requires very close collaboration and communication with the very supply chain, whether its equipment suppliers, whether it’s construction companies, etcetera. So no impact on that for us other than the things that we consciously chose to slow down and have now restarted. Second with recycling, we can spend hours on this. What I might refer you to and we can be happy to take it offline because we had addressed this very directly, because it varies by country, it varies by region and the salts for each of the countries and regions are different. But if you go to our new sustainability report at, and I think Dan mentioned ball.com/sustainability it will all be laid out there in a very transparent way and we'd be happy to engage with anyone on this, because I think that's what continued success of the beverage can means. We have to continue improving the already good recycling rates because from an LCA perspective, it positions the can even stronger relative to PET and relative to glass.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Just one other one for me on the capital spending. So I think Dan mentioned this that the practical size of these two new plants may be bigger than anything else you've got here in the states, I think now typically we think of kind of four lines is about the biggest beverage can plants out there. Is there any kind of practical limit size of a beverage can plant that you would want to put in? I mean could it be six or seven?
John Hayes: It could, but remember then you've got to factor in shipping. And you could make it all in one place and ship it thousands of miles and lose all that money to the freight company. So there's a balance. But theoretically, you could build something as big as you want, just because you've got to look at where you're supplying.
Mark Wilde: So what is the practical limit, do you think, John?
John Hayes: It depends by region. In the Northeast, for example, Northeast and Southwest, where we're talking about doing this, a population that's where the biggest and/or growing the fastest. So it makes sense if you were to say to do it in Iowa wouldn't make sense. So it very much depends.
Mark Wilde: Okay, I'll turn it over. Good luck.
Operator: And our final question is from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question.
Gabe Hajde: Good morning, gentlemen. I hope everyone is doing well.
John Hayes: Yes. Thank you. You too.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you. I want to come out the U.S. question from a little bit of a different angle. I know you guys don't typically talk about utilization rates, but I've heard the term fallout from virtually everyone. So I'm assuming that somewhere in the upper 90s. And I think maybe safe utilization you guys have talked about before where you feel comfortable is something more 95%. And so if I take a differential of 3% that implies that maybe you guys have already made 3 billion cans more than you otherwise would from higher utilization rates. And if you're bringing in as an industry 2.5 billion unit, you're actually short 5.5 billion such that this 15 billion, 16 billion units of capacity coming to the market is actually not that big of a deal. Is that what you were trying to get out John before in terms of building a case?
John Hayes: Yes, as an industry, I tend to -- don't forget there's been new capacity by some of our competitors over the last 18 months. So they've been benefiting from that. But you're absolutely right. We are running full out. And as a result, the way you're thinking about strategically, I think is the right way to think about it.
Dan Fisher: The only other lever that you did not indicate is working with our customers on lowering safety stock levels. So that's the other lever where you can get more volume up.
Gabe Hajde: Okay. And then I guess transitioning over to Europe, you mentioned in the release that you're adding multiple lines to support market recovery as well as a capacity for North American market. And I'm assuming that wasn't the intent necessarily when these lines were planned. So I guess does that imply sort of a protracted recovery in Europe? And I'm trying to marry that up. I thought I heard you say Dan, kind of mid to high single digit volume growth in the back half of the year. And then as a quick follow up to that, as I guess energy production migrates across different parts of the globe, does that free up some capacity for you guys next year as that ramps up?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think, yes, the 5% to 8% on the back half of the year in Europe is correct. You heard that right. It's yet to be determined on the bounce back of energy drink or through the convenience channel. I think that's more or less where you were headed with that question. Some of those companies will be -- they'll go to where they can sell their products. So you might see more multipack. Right. You might see that showing up in retail different than the convenience store channel there.
John Hayes: Yes, but on your capital, say, I just want to clarify. We're not putting capital in Europe to export into the U.S., this is for the long-term growth in Europe. And whether it's the growth we've seen in the U.K. or in Russia or parts of Eastern Europe, that's where that's going. And we will -- I think you are also referencing in terms of energy, it's not as if certain customers are moving, filling from Europe to other places. They're actually adding in other places and keeping what they have in Europe because they see the growth opportunity in front of them.
Gabe Hajde: Thank you, guys. Good luck.
John Hayes: Okay, Kelly, do we have any final questions?
Operator: No, we have no further questions at this time, sir.
John Hayes: Okay, great. Well, thank you, Kelly, and thank you everyone for your participation. Everyone, stay safe, stay well. And we look forward to hopefully seeing many of you virtually at least on our Investor Day on October six. Take care.
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-09 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 7, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you, Rita, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2020 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release financials include descriptions of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other non-reportable segments.  As we all know, coronavirus has had a profound impact upon the global business environment. Countries around the world have issued stay-at-home orders and instructed non-essential businesses to temporarily close. Ball provides key aluminum packaging products and services to the consumer beverage, household and pharmaceutical markets, as well as aerospace technologies and services to the U.S. government. Consequentially, the operations of Ball and of its principal customers and suppliers have been designated as essential businesses across our key markets. This designation allowed Ball to continue to operate its manufacturing facilities without significant disruption throughout the first quarter of 2020. Ball is humbled by our ability to operate in this environment. Throughout our 140-year history, we have relied on our people, our culture and our businesses' resiliency to navigate tough times, while also envisioning and investing in a brighter future, and that is what we are doing. I would like to personally thank our frontline employees, as well as those manning the front lines of our suppliers and customers. Their dedication to working safely while delivering the necessary goods and services have been critical in our support of our communities across the globe and has played a large role in serving the critical missions and programs of the U.S. government. On behalf of our entire company, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the global health care community as well as the dedicated professionals and volunteers providing social services to those in need. At Ball, no matter what the circumstances, we always strive to do well, while also doing good. At the onset of the crisis, we sought to do our part by providing hospitals and agencies with donations of masks and protective gowns through our aerospace operations, canned drinking water from our global beverage operations and aluminum cylinders used for the construction of ventilators from our global aluminum aerosol business. In addition, we stepped up our support for the Red Cross, Red Crescent Society, and have empowered our local employees to dedicate an additional $5 million to those critical areas in the communities in which we operate so that we can continue to be an active part of our communities that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. I'm happy to share that at the same time, we were able to execute our strategy, continue investing in the future, maintain our dividend, and consistently return value to shareholders. Undoubtedly, there will be effects on our business from COVID-19, and we will continue to manage our company appropriately to ensure employee safety, support of our customers and ample liquidity for our company. We are controlling the things that we can control, and Ball is well positioned for the near and long term. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO; as well as Dan Fisher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance and trends. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses, as well as our outlook for the company. First quarter results were strong. And in mid-March, we were able to transition effectively our non-manufacturing employees to working remotely due to global collaboration across our IT, HR, operations, corporate and global business service teams. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share increased 24%, and comparable operating earnings for the corporation were up 12%, with global beverage packaging operation earnings up 5% and aerospace operating earnings up 33% year-over-year. The company continues to operate with ample liquidity, including $800 million in cash on hand at the end of the quarter, $550 million in committed lines available and another $500 million in uncommitted lines. This, in addition to our strong annual cash flow, allows us to execute our strategy and stay on track with multiple growth projects. During the quarter, global beverage volumes were up 4%. Our aerospace won-not-booked backlog increased 14%, and we announced our intent to acquire an aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in Brazil. As we reflect on year-to-date 2020 performance and the long-term resiliency of our company, our team is well equipped operationally and organizationally to navigate the current environment and deliver growth in value creation for our shareholders. And the core tenet of our culture has never been clearer, we know who we are, we know where we're going, and we know what's important. Our strategy of investing in the growth opportunities across our various business remain intact. And while the short-term visibility is strained due to the virus and its near-term impact on the various economies, our long-term outlook has not changed. In good times and bad, consumer demand for our packaging products has always remained resilient, and the needs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for our government customers has never been stronger. Dan and Scott will discuss the current state of our end markets and the opportunities and risks as we see in the near term, including dislocations to date. Due to the volatility of regions and businesses, we will limit our comments to facts, as they exist today, for it'd both imprudent and unwise to prognosticate or extrapolate the near future with any degree of precision. Now, key highlights for the first quarter include, overall global beverage volume grew 4%. North America was up 4%, due to a late quarter surge and at-home consumption and would have been up even higher, if not for the very tight supply conditions in North America that we have discussed previously. European volumes were up 5% and were up 8% after the first two months, with March being down meaningfully, in Southern Europe and the Nordic countries. South American volumes were up 1% and were up mid-single digits after the first two months, with March being significantly down, particularly, in Brazil and Paraguay. Dan will give more color around these trends and the trends we've been seeing in April in his remarks. Our aerospace business continues to execute well and was up over 30% in operating earnings. We continue to win work and believe that despite the current environment, most, if not all of our short and long-term goals in this business for 2020 and beyond remain intact. Our aluminum aerosol business was relatively flat for the quarter after experiencing similar trends that our beverage can business experienced, and we announced our intent to acquire an aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant from Tubex in Brazil. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. Construction and hiring for our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility remains on track. Despite the current curtailments of all major sports and entertainment venues, our outlook for 2020 continues to be strong, with letters of intent executed for next year, actually ahead of our plans. And we've also used this time to accelerate our retail go-to-market strategy for 2021 and beyond. In summary, we had a strong first quarter that would have even been much stronger, if corona had not hit us. Our second quarter, like most companies will be soft, particularly, in South America and to a lesser extent, in Europe. We believe at this time that the overall strength of our remaining businesses will allow us to grow operating earnings over the year, and it obviously will be dependent upon the overall impact of the virus and the timing of the opening of our economies in the second half this year. Thank you to all of our colleagues here at Ball for caring for one another. Your dedication in the face of circumstances we cannot control, and your hard work to support our customers, our communities and the global economies where we operate is truly inspiring. We extend our well wishes to all of you listening and for your continued safety and good health. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. And I echo those sentiments. And in addition to thanking our amazing manufacturing teams, I also want to thank our customers, our suppliers and logistics providers for their collaboration to maintain our industry's ability to serve consumer demand. Last and certainly not least, I have to applaud both our HR leadership and our environmental health and safety professionals. This is an unprecedented time, and they have not missed a beat in helping to keep our Ball family safe. Earlier this year, during our previous call, I set the stage for 2020 and beyond. My comments focused on demand growth, still water shifting to cans, new customer contracts in North America, our ability to serve market growth in advance of new capacity additions, hiring and training to serve growth, operational excellence, aluminum supply, new product introductions and our sustainability progress to position Ball as a partner of choice. Those near-term external forces have focused additional time and energy to adapt to new safety protocols. Our team's desire to execute on each of these important initiatives has not wavered. We recently announced approval of our science-based targets to reduce our carbon emissions, as well as those of our value chain and also achieved ASI Certification across our European operations, both industry firsts and vitally important, to positioning Ball and our packages as a partner of choice for sustainability. Today, my goal is to provide as much information and transparency into our near-term operating environment as possible, while encouraging all of you to focus on our long-term plans and prospects for growth, which even under the current environment, we feel strongly that aluminum packaging will continue to benefit from the sustainability tailwinds we benefited from entering the pandemic. Across our global operations, our teams have been nimble and collaborative. From the onset of the pandemic, daily calls with management, Global Presidents, supply chain sales, operations, HR and corporate support teams have kept everyone informed, supported and aligned with local and regional mandates and focus on the best outcomes possible for our colleagues and our customers from a safety and business continuity perspective. Across our supply chain, we have supported one another, shared best practices when necessary, align procedures for managing brief periods of downtime when a customer supplier or Ball have experienced COVID cases in our operations. We are thankful that our employees impacted by the virus are on the mend or back at work, following the recovery. Today, we continue to manage sporadic operational disruptions as well as tremendous growth, complexity and incredibly tight supply/demand conditions, particularly in North America. Consumer behavior varies by region. In North America, consumers are able to access multiple shopping channels, stock up and store bulk packages of our product. This led to a short-term surge in beverage can demand, as those occasions that occurred at the on-premise and convenience channels shifted to the at-home or off-premise channels. While this trend has diminished somewhat in April, we generally expect higher-than-anticipated volumes to continue until such time the on-premise begins to open up. The biggest challenge for us will be supplying such demand, until we can get our additional capacity online. The additional challenge we faced is that the volume is coming largely from more traditional packs for home consumption, and that has not been the focus of our capacity adds in the short-term. In Europe, volume remained relatively normal throughout the quarter, safe for Southern Europe, including Turkey, where relatively more beverage containers are consumed on-premise and on-the-go than in other regions due largely to the tourism trade, and the Nordics where the usual cross-border transactions were curtailed due to travel restrictions. In April, we are seeing those trends continue, and we're turning our attention to what consumption patterns might be impacted further in Russia, where areas like Moscow have been quarantined far later than most of Europe. In South America, we saw seasonally strong demand through early March across the region, followed by a significant slowdown in Brazil and Paraguay. To give context, we saw an approximate 60% decrease in canned shipments in Brazil in the last two weeks of March alone, due to the temporary closing of many of the smaller grocery stores, gas stations and convenience stores, where over 60% of beverage cans are purchased. In April, those trends continued, although over the past two weeks, we have seen an improvement closer to an approximate 20% to 30% decline as some of these stores have reopened. Chile and Argentina have been much more resilient, given that nearly 85% of cans are purchased for the off-trade. From a segment operating performance perspective, Ball's North American segment earnings were up 24%. Favorably negotiated customer contracts, operational improvements across the network and volume growth benefited the quarter and were partially offset by hiring costs associated with new manufacturing lines ramping up in the second half of 2020 and mix associated with certain can sizes sold through the convenience store channel. As previously announced, line additions in our existing Rome, Georgia and Fort Worth, Texas beverage can manufacturing facilities as well as our new two line specialty beverage can plant in Glendale, Arizona are on track to come online in the second half of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively. As of today, we're still moving forward with our plans in the Northeast with an expected start-up in the second half of 2021. Despite C-store traffic slowdown in April, which has limited growth in the energy drink category and higher costs associated with the pandemic to support self-isolation protocols when needed, I fully expect strong at-home consumption trends across most categories and earnings momentum across North America in 2020 and beyond. In our EMEA segment, despite the negative demand trends resulting from the pandemic in Italy, Spain and France, we were able to operate our facilities nearly continuously across the segment during the quarter. We thank our colleagues across Europe for their dedication and ability to support 5% volume growth during the quarter, while managing various country mandates. Our volumes remain strong in Russia, the U.K. and Egypt, while we saw upper single-digit declines in Southern Europe, the Nordics and Turkey. First quarter EMEA segment earnings were down slightly due to 2 million of euro earnings translation headwinds, higher freight and warehousing costs due to sales demand shifts by region and intermittent line downtime late in the quarter and absorption associated with integrating the Turkish and Egyptian operations into this segment. We remain focused on long-term growth opportunities and are leveraging the segment's plant network to add lines to our existing facilities, in preparation for our customers' installation of additional can filling lines. Due to recent travel restrictions between European countries, certain projects have shifted to the right slightly and will not impact our near-term customer commitments. Historical quarterly comparisons for our EMEA and other non-reportable segments have been adjusted accordingly to reflect the company's existing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Manisa, Turkey, being consolidated into the EMEA segment and out of other non-reportable. Turning to our Southern American segment. First quarter earnings were down slightly, driven by regional customer mix and the abrupt contractions in Brazilian demand in late March. Ball is the largest producer of beverage cans in South America with nine plants in Brazil and one each in Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. Even with our plants in Chile, Paraguay and Argentina continuing to operate, we expect our second quarter South American segment operating earnings to be down meaningful year-over-year. It is important to note that this is a seasonally slower quarter, and our team is staying close to our customers and managing our assets and costs appropriately to ensure the best outcome. As we look forward, Brazilian consumers are beginning to see gas stations and convenience stores reopen near their homes, and we will closely monitor their ability to make purchases. The company's Myanmar, India and Saudi beverage can manufacturing results continue to be reported in other non-reportable. The plants continue to operate and were similarly impacted by intermittent downtime in late March and early April. In addition, other includes a 20 million P&L investment to stand up our aluminum cup business. In summary, global beverage can demand momentum continues in the majority of regions where we operate. Our teams are actively hiring to support our anticipated growth in North America and are focused on maintaining and supporting our skilled labor base across our other operating regions. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable first quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.61 versus $0.49 in 2019. Dan commented on the other non-reportable segment changes in the quarter. Please note that other includes aluminum aerosol operating earnings and results from our beverage can plants in Myanmar, India and Saudi Arabia, offset by undistributed corporate costs and investments to stand up our new aluminum cost business. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid global aluminum beverage and aerosol shipments, strong aerospace performance, a lower share count and lower corporate costs, offset by foreign exchange headwinds and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Due to the pass-through of lower cost aluminum and the 2019 sale of the Argentine steel aerosol business and Chinese beverage can assets, revenues for the first quarter were flat despite global beverage can growth of 4% and higher aerospace revenues. Ball's balance sheet is healthy. Debt has been termed out at low rates. We have no debt maturities until 2022. Our credit agreements go out until 2024, and we have focused near term on maintaining ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. Year-to-date, we experienced our seasonal working capital build, which was more sizable than typical, due largely to the timing of metal payments in the first quarter. Given our ongoing growth initiatives and a somewhat longer raw material supply chain to support them, we anticipate the full year 2020 working capital investment to be a use of cash in the range of $275 million. As we look to the remainder of 2020, here are some additional key metrics to keep in mind. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 20%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $280 million, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other non-reportable are now expected to be in the range of $65 million. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be strong. We will be investing in working capital and growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity in North America, while also completing construction on our first aluminum cups manufacturing facilities. At this point, we may approach full year 2020 CapEx of $800 million. Given the near-term challenging business conditions in Brazil and the investment in working capital I mentioned above, we now expect 2020 free cash flow in the range of $500 million. Ball has always been focused on being good stewards of our cash and prudently balancing real-time conditions with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our strong cash flow, we are maintaining our quarterly dividends, just as we have done since becoming a public company in 1972. Like always, we will focus on managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively and consistently returning value to our long-term shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aluminum aerosol business saw global volumes up 2% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit demand in North America and India, which offset mid-single-digit declines in Europe. With the vast majority of aluminum aerosol packaging consumption tied to at-home, personal care and health, our aluminum aerosol team has been busy supporting personal care and pharmaceutical packaging needs. While our plants remain busy throughout the quarter, we do expect a few regional fillers to experience intermittent downtime during the second quarter that could affect us. Looking ahead, we are excited to expand our aluminum aerosol business' geographic reach into South America and expect the acquisition of the Tubex facility to close in the third quarter. In addition, our new innovative Infinity bottle continues to attract interest from customers looking for a sustainable, reclosable and reusable solution for personal care products, including shampoos and lotions. We look forward to growing this global business and improving performance in 2020 and beyond. Our aerospace business reported approximately 33% revenue and operating earnings growth, resulting from solid contract performance. Similar to our global packaging business, our aerospace business has been deemed an essential business, supporting our national security, defense and other services. The team has done an outstanding job of transitioning the majority of colleagues to working remotely, organizing program teams and shifts, and completing key project milestones remotely. In addition, during the first quarter, the aerospace business total contracted backlog was $2.3 billion. Our won-not-booked backlog increased 14%, and our headcount increased by over 250 employees. With over 50% of our aerospace employees new to Ball since 2018, we continue to be impressed by their seamless immersion into the Ball culture. Their ability to execute and take on exciting work is appreciated. In this business, we continue to enhance our infrastructure, build out testing and manufacturing facilities in 2020, and ensure all projects are on track and on budget. We continue to win new work, and current indications reflect that our aerospace business will be able to grow profitability in excess of 15% per year over the next several years, given the scale and type of recent contract awards. While we and the rest of the world are experiencing short-term dislocation, our long-term prospects remain bright, and we are focused on bridging the short-term dislocation with the long-term opportunities. Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace, while delivering significant value for our shareholders. Beyond 2020, we look forward to driving our business to deliver long-term diluted earnings per share growth of at least 10% to 15% and achieve our EVA dollars growth of 4% to 8% per year on our growing invested capital base. This has not changed. Especially during these times, we are thankful for our successes to date and the opportunities of the future. We will continue to responsibly invest and do what is best for Ball, our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders' long-term success. And with that, Rita, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neel Kumar from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Slutsky: Hi. This is actually Michael Slutsky sitting in for Neel. Thank you for the details. Just could you maybe address, what gives you confidence in a late 2020 rebound in Brazil? Just based on past recessions and weaker macro environments, have you seen more sensitivity from Brazilian consumers in terms of demand that consumption had?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I appreciate the question. I'd be leery to prognosticate on what exactly is going to happen in the second half of the year, but consistent with my comments in the script, we have seen channels opening back up over the last couple of weeks. The market was off, at least in our business, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% year-on-year. And as we sit here today, it's running closer to 20% off, year-on-year. And a lot of that, candidly, is slowly but surely depending on city-by-city, state-by-state in Brazil. Some of these channels are opening up. And as soon as they've opened up, our customers, most of the brewers have started to fill them, and we're paying very close attention to that, but Brazil is not operating as a homogenous marketplace. It's still quite scattered, and we've really got to see this continue to take root, hopefully, build some momentum before we can, say it with any level of certainty that we can gauge the second half of the year. That being said, some positive signs here over the last couple of weeks.
Michael Slutsky: Okay. Yes. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up, I guess. Are you seeing any impact from the pandemic in Mexico? I think you mentioned that it's about 10% of segment volumes. Is that still about accurate? And are you planning on sending any cans from Mexico into North America to kind of support the growth environment there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Good question. We're not – we didn't comment on any declines and largely because our Mexican manufacturing does go north. The beer percentage has slowed at the end of March, early April, just because of some of the laws that have been put in place by the Mexican government there, but as you've indicated in your comment, North America, we started the year in an oversold environment. We're still in an oversold environment. And so some of the declines in the beer production have really opened up an opportunity for us to candidly run more CSD and ship that north. And so those plants are all full. They're running full. They're running a different mix, different label SKU than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, but we're absolutely using that as an opportunity to keep cans on the shelves in North America right now.
Michael Slutsky: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Burgmeier: Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. What was the total impact of the onetime costs in EMEA bev, such as freight, warehousing and integration? And do you expect any of those costs to carry into the second quarter?
Scott Morrison: In EMEA?
Bryan Burgmeier: Yes.
Scott Morrison: The costs in the first quarter probably were not that great. I mean we've had some intermittent downtime with some plants, but maybe $5 million. And I think the second quarter will fill more of the impact in EMEA and obviously, in South America. And then hopefully, things get back to some normalization more in the third quarter, but I think the impact in the second quarter will be great.
Dan Fisher: Yes. We were much like – I would say, in every one of our major regions, the first 8 to 10 weeks of the year, we were growing in excess of what we thought heading into the year, and some of that contributed to the typical out-of-pattern freight, not having cans in the right locations in Europe. Given the pullback in demand, I can't foresee a lot of those costs showing up, specifically, in the second quarter as we sit here today.
Bryan Burgmeier: Great. Yes. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, just considering the economic conditions right now, can you summarize the financial health of some of your smaller craft beer customers? And do you think it's possible that working capital could be impacted, if those customers perform worse than they had anticipated?
Scott Morrison: Yes. We've got something we're watching very closely. Obviously, we have a lot of craft beer customers. A lot of the really small ones, they're actually kind of cash in advance. So from a credit exposure perspective, there really isn't that much credit exposure. And we're working with some of the other larger ones that, to be honest, are looking at this as an opportunity to grow their footprint. And so we're working selectively with our customers to help in situations where they think they can grow their business and be supportive of that.
Bryan Burgmeier: Great. Thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi guys, Good morning and hope everybody is doing well.
John Hayes: Yes. Thanks Ghansham.
John Hayes: Yes. I guess back to Brazil, I mean, the region has seen torrid growth for many quarters now. And now you have this pandemic event that obviously led to an abrupt slowdown. How much of the 60% decline in the back half of March do you think came from inventory destocking, just along the supply chain? I mean your customers are big and levered also, and I assume, started to focus on cash aggressively. And what's an appropriate decremental margin to use for the South America region for 2Q? And maybe, just comment on the same thing for Europe as well.
John Hayes: Yes. Ghansham, this is John. I'll try and take that. In the second half, there was such an abrupt slowdown, but it really was, as Dan had mentioned, the closure of a lot of these channels where the products were sold. Obviously, when – and then that has a ripple-on effect because inventories then start to build for our customers that already had. We're brewing beer, for example and other things like that. As we go and talk about second quarter, I'm hesitant to throw out any numbers because that's just imprudent. We started at the beginning of April, as Dan had said, off 60%, and it's improved. So the trend line is improving. We will be down meaningfully in the second quarter, but let's not forget about the longer-term prospects here. And we do expect the world to open up a little bit more in the second half. And – even in Brazil. And as we go into 2021 and beyond, as we sit here today, I don't think fundamentally much has changed. And so that's why in my prepared comments, we talked about – this is really a bridge from the short-term dislocation that the world is facing to the long-term opportunities that still remain on our plate.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then just for my second question, I guess, on working cap – on free cash flow. So, basically, last quarter, you said $600 million of free cash flow. Now you're saying $500 million, and the delta really seems to be working capital. So does that imply then that you based expectations for the full-year are more or less intact? I mean obviously, there's variability across the regions, but is that a fair statement?
Scott Morrison: Well, there's a lot of moving pieces on free cash flow. So, let's talk about the working capital side first. We had a larger-than-typical build in the first quarter. Most of that had to do with the timing of metal payments in Q1 as we built up additional inventory in metal in Q3 and Q4 to support the growth really in North America. And then – and as I've mentioned before, we've got a longer supply chain than we used to have. And so when we paid for that metal in first quarter, that was a big impact. We've also had several instances globally of VAT taxes being held up by various governments around the world that are essentially shut down. So, we've got about 100 million build in VAT taxes that we're waiting to receive, which is just the timing issue. And then as we go through the year, with the growth of our business, we see a use of working capital of about $275 million. And I think in the first – or the year-end call, I said it would be about $150 million. So, a little bit larger than I thought at the beginning of the year. And from a free cash flow standpoint, we still think we can get to around $800 million of CapEx, and then we found some other things that we think will be positive from a free cash flow standpoint. It goes back to that $500 million of free cash flow.
John Hayes: Yes. And Ghansham, this is John. The only thing I'd add is when I think from a free cash flow, and I think from an operating earnings perspective, virtually every segment we have saved for South America is large and on track. Europe may be a little bit softer than we thought three months ago, but South America will be softer. It's just how much we don't know right now. And obviously, those earnings kind of translated into free cash flow as well.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Hope you’re well and thanks for all you're doing with COVID as well. I wanted to hit a bit of a longer-term question. And John, you mentioned that you obviously remain confident in the longer-term picture for Ball Corp. When we've seen significant disruption from an economic standpoint, I think COVID would stand up to that test. Sometimes, not always, you'll see changes in consumer behavior, changes in consumer purchasing patterns. I don't know if you have any data on this, but what makes you comfortable that cans will continue to grow at the rate they've been growing, that the sort of value of the consumer will be the same? And specifically in some of the non-North American markets where you have more competition from returnable glass, what makes you comfortable that returnable glass, at least for a period, wouldn't show up in a larger way in consumer pantries versus cans? And then I have a couple of follow-ons.
John Hayes: Yes. Let me take that, and then I may actually turn it over to Dan. So, there's a couple of questions embedded in that. I think the first one is – and let's not forget, you have to look through – this is a significant economic dislocation. Let's not kid ourselves. We, as a society, have gone through that as well, and 2008 was one of them, back in early 2000s was another one of them. We have gone back over the past 25, 30 years and looked at what has happened to our business. And I'll just focus on 2008 since it was closest to what we're experiencing here. We had a quarter of down volumes, and then everything bounced back; from a free cash flow perspective we continue to generate good cash flow. From an earnings perspective, you had a 1 quarter, but it did bounce back. And so that's one data point to give you context and also to answer your second question, which gets to – we have seen – there are some facts that we can point to that from – particularly from a sustainability perspective that show the can is winning. Dan had mentioned some of those things. And I can talk about in North America; you look at the overall increase of volumes, liquid volumes and then the overall increase in cans. In every major category, cans are outgrowing the overall liquid growth, and so that means cans are taking share. You can do the same thing in Europe. And as we talked before, Southern Europe is a bit different than Northern Europe, but nonetheless, cans are doing well. I think it has to do with sustainability, but it also has to do with shelf life. That is important because we know the [alternate] products, and they don't have a good of a shelf life. In South America, and particularly as it relates to your question about returnable, our facts are based upon conversations we've been having with our customers about the growth of cans relative to other packages. And so it's a bit of fact, it's a bit of conversations with our customer, but it's all grounded – and it's a bit of sustainability, but it's all grounded in the fact when you look at the overall liquid volume trends and then you overlay that on what's happening with cans, cans appear to be taking share. So Dan, do you have anything else to add?
Dan Fisher: I would say, George, that the most confidence that I can give you or point to are more in line with the conversations that we're having real-time with our customers. And those customers are moving forward even faster with their can line expansions and investments, and we're having negotiations with them to support that and those investments. And as Scott indicated that – when we're looking to manage our cash flow so intently, we're having those conversations frequently with those customers to make sure that we're not getting out ahead of them, and we're still consistently applying these sustainability trends in line with what they're going to promote and what they're going to push. So at least for now, George, it's as good, if not better, than what I would have anticipated at this time.
George Staphos: Dan, that's great. I appreciate all the color from you on that. Second question, you – the company talked about confidence – I forgot exactly how you said it, but the supply chain – you don't see any issues in the supply chain. There's been, again, the more recent discussion on trade war scuttlebutt, obviously, between the U.S. and China. How do you feel about your ability to continue to get can sheet given some of the more recent chatter there? And there's been some discussion about CO2 shortages for different reasons, obviously. What are your customers saying about that? And then my last question to Scott, and I'll turn it over. Obviously, we're looking at, from what you said, earnings per share growth this year based on what you can see and I think you said EVA dollar growth as well. Is there a way that you can directionally dimensionalize that? Do you think EVA dollars grow more quickly than EPS this year? Or any other color there would be helpful. Thank you guys and I’ll turn it over.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Let me try to address the metal piece. Obviously, we've got some temporary relief on some of the tariffs as it relates to inbound metal from China. I think the larger story versus where we were here 90 days ago is that with the steep falloff in auto sales and even on – as it relates to Boeing and Airbus, their demand starting to fall off pretty significantly. I think there's an awful lot more available can sheet or willingness to convert some lines to can sheet than there was 90 days ago. And so from a domestic supply chain standpoint, it looks like a much better environment for us right now than it did even 90 days ago. So we're – and we can step into that. So it's not just a theory, we're waiting for something. We can absolutely step into some of those in a meaningful way right now. The CO2, I – George, I have not heard any issues right now in our supply chain as it relates to CO2 shortages, but that will give me something to dig into a little bit more. And I was recently in conversations as early as this week with the two large CSD players, and nothing along that came up in our supply discussion, so.
Scott Morrison: On the earnings per share growth in 2020, I think, George, we had a nice growth in the first quarter. I think we'll give that back in the second quarter. And then I think we have a chance to grow earnings in the back half of the year. From an EVA dollar standpoint, I do not think we grow EVA dollars in 2020, but we will in 2021. Given the investments that we made last year and this year and the hit we're taking on earnings in Brazil, I don't think EVA dollars grow this year, but we're confident that the long-term is still intact.
George Staphos: Thanks Scott. Appreciate the details. Good luck in the quarter.
Scott Morrison: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tyler Langton: Hi, good morning John, Scott, and Dan. Hope you are all doing well?
John Hayes : We are. Thanks.
Tyler Langton: Just had a question on North America, I know sort of last quarter, the idea that sort of the aluminum scrap issues were behind you and some of the inefficiencies from higher growth were behind you. Obviously, things have changed a little bit. And you also talked about maybe, I guess, mix being a little bit weaker in North America just with the higher level of at-home consumption. I guess, could you just talk about where we are now with those issues, with the aluminum scrap and inefficiencies from last year and just, I guess, potential offsets from COVID sort of more recently?
Dan Fisher: Sure. Yes. I think the scrap issue is largely behind us. And I think we made a comment to that effect, at least the last two calls. The majority – I'd say 80% of the issue we saw last year, we resolved that in a contract that started Jan 1 this year. So you will see consistent performance in and around that scrap line for the balance of the year because of that contract change. Yes, we saw nice productivity improvement in the first quarter out of our North American business. They did a really nice job. And we saw some of that reflect in some of the absorption benefit even with an incredibly strong sales performance. So I've seen a lot of positive signs and positive movements in that business across all of our plants. The number of plants that had production records in the quarter was, I think, all but two. So I think that the team has really galvanized their focus on the right things, and we're seeing a lot of benefits there. We absolutely do need to get these projects executed on in North America. Nothing has changed in that regard. And in fact, we exited Q1 with some of the lowest inventory levels we've ever had in Q1 because of that pantry stocking phenomenon that took place and continued in the first part of April. So good news there is the projects, Fort Worth, Rome, Glendale, they are on track, if not maybe slightly ahead, but we will – so quite a ways to go. The biggest challenge we've got, candidly, is typically you do on-job training, and so with social distancing trying to get 50 or 60 employees into another facility to run can lines and learn on the fly. That – so we're spending a lot more time on classroom, online training, virtual training, and the team has done a hell of a job and been very creative in trying to get those folks up to speed so they can hit the ground running, but really pleased with the overall progress in North America. If I said anything, I'd say we're a little bit ahead of where I thought we'd be at this time really on multiple fronts there.
John Hayes: Yes. Tyler, this is John. I'll just add my [indiscernible] on that. I completely agree with everything, Dan. And it could have been so much better. I mean we had $7 million or $8 million of currency headwind just because of the Mexico peso devalued at a rate the fastest ever happened in history. We had start-up costs in the range of kind of $8 million plus or minus related to all the start-up things Dan had mentioned there.  So, when you look at the year-over-year there and – we had talked about that business having a chance of being up $100 million year-over-year in a seasonally slow first quarter, it being more than a quarter of that, and we had those various headwinds in addition to the mix headwind Dan talked about with the convenience channel slowing down abruptly in the month of March, you can see why there's been a lot of great work going on in that business.
Tyler Langton: Okay. Perfect. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, Scott, on working capital. I know you mentioned some of that obviously was from sort of the longer supply chains and buying metal. I mean is this more – should we think about this as more of a onetime hit where you're sort of making sure you have enough metal? Or is it something where the longer supply chain could have an impact sort of going forward, creating elevated working capital more on a longer-term basis?
Scott Morrison: No. Good question. The first quarter impact was definitely more of a one-time. We were – we wanted to make sure we had plenty of metal given the growth we were seeing in our business in North America. So, we really ramped up our take of metal in the third and fourth quarter, and we paid for that in the first quarter. That's kind of normalized. And I would say the longer supply chain is built into my number where I've said working capital would be a use this year of $275 million. That longer supply chain is accounted for in that number.
John Hayes: Yes. And I think beyond 2020, I don't think that's more of a onetime. We can't anticipate – obviously, it depends upon the growth, right?
Scott Morrison: Yes.
John Hayes: But because of what Dan just said of – with the auto and commercial aircraft declining, we probably have an opportunity as we go forward to bring more domestic supply online, which has always been our preference and now that kind of stars are lining up. So I think from a longer-term perspective, it probably is more of a onetime [use].
Dan Fisher: Yes. I'd agree.
Tyler Langton: Okay. Perfect. And then just last question on aerospace. And obviously, you continue to see strong growth. I mean, I guess – and I'm guessing sort of just the – all the hiring that you're doing that's kind of still weighing on margins. And in terms of CapEx, you're sort of still spending to grow that business. Just post-2020, is there a way to think about what CapEx looks like in 2021 and sort of should cost – for all – the hiring start to ease a little bit?
John Hayes: Well, remember that the cost, it depends upon the mix of business, but we get a little bit of a drag from the growth, but it's really just a timing issue at the end of the day. So, I wouldn't focus too much on that. And on the CapEx, the big bubble is in 2020 right now. As we go into 2021, it will ramp down. But we're putting a fair amount of capital for the next five years plus in that business. So I would expect that to come down. And I can – as I said in my prepared remarks, the business is going quite well. We're bidding on tremendous amount of work right now. Work seems to be accelerating, not decelerating. And so we feel good about that business. And that's why I said we remain confident that, that business can continue to grow kind of 15-plus percent over the next few years.
Tyler Langton: Great. Thanks so much. I’ll turn it over.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you are all well. I guess, firstly, just wanted to ask about capital return plans for this year. Obviously, I understand the cash – preserving cash is probably the first priority, but could you just kind of reiterate your position on share repurchases as well? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: Sure. This is Scott. We acquired some stock in Q1 before the impact of COVID was really seen, and then we suspended repurchases for the time being and focused on preserving our liquidity. We have ample liquidity and committed credit. And we're really just now at our seasonal working capital build. So, as we move through the rest of the year, our liquidity and our cash generation will get better.  And we still expect to generate $0.5 billion of free cash flow. So as we progress through the year, we'll see if we have opportunities to return more value to shareholders in the back half of the year. But let me be clear, our capital allocation strategy has not changed at all.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess I just wanted to get back to North America. So two questions here. First, pricing has been part of the story, I guess, last year and this year catching up to prior inflation and resetting some of these contracts that the returns really aren't up to desired levels. So, I guess do you expect that to continue? And then secondly on volume in North America, I just wanted to clarify, maybe you could just explain again what we should expect from a percent volume growth expectation, just because you guys do face a little bit tougher comps than the industry growth. And again, your sold out position is a little different, and so that should evolve in the second half of the year. So how should we think about both price and volume, I guess, in North America? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think in North America, not much has changed in terms of kind of the guidance we gave for the short term, 2020, in particular. I would expect 3% to 5% growth, somewhere in that neighborhood. And it's largely going to be contingent on our ability to execute these line expansions in the back half of the year. So, we definitely need to step into well-executed start-ups and fill those lines. I don't think there will be a problem filling those lines. So, I'm feeling quite bullish about what we entered the year with in terms of volume in North America. And as I mentioned in my comments, the only thing that's moving around on us, quite honestly, is somewhat on the mix side. More historical packaging for the at-home multipack and with the C-store channels not fully open, that obviously can change some of our – specifically Ball's mix.
Arun Viswanathan: And do you think that at all is potential to be a structural change i.e., specialty can growth has really driven a lot of the growth the last couple of years, non-12-ounce that is? So as we revert back to 12-ounce growth, is that something that we should change and incorporate into our view on profitability for you from a medium-term standpoint?
Dan Fisher: I think it's a great question. And I really wish we had some sociologists on the payroll right now to try to figure out consumer behavior patterns. But in all candor, what – an awful lot of the folks that purchase in C-store channels are really tied to the service industry. So, think about people working multiple jobs in the restaurant space. As they come back, I don't think there will be a change in consumption pattern, but it will be tied to employment, it will be tied to what's open. That's more going to be the impact and the thing to watch there. I'm very bullish on innovation moving forward. We're still engaged with a number of customers on new product launches. Right now, most folks are just trying to get cans into the channels and multipacks to – because of the increased velocity, but folks aren't going to move away from innovation on the can. So, I don't think that will be a permanent trend by any stretch of the imagination.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Maguire: Hi, everyone. Hope you are doing well. First question, I just wanted to follow on that mix comment in question, obviously, more shifting to the standard 12-ounce can and probably a lot through the club stores. You talked about customers sort of rationalizing SKUs. From your own production point of view, does that help you eke out a little bit more throughput on your plants running more standard lines and not having to do as many changeovers? And then as you think about the mix impact just on profitability, whether it's margins or returns of capital. Does it change materially between one and the other?
Dan Fisher: No, I think it's a great question. So we're sort of – if you're looking at this from a year-over-year comp perspective, you're entering a period where you're sold out, every single line sold out. So, just hitting the mix question first. If now, I'm – I have a 12-ounce, 16-ounce line, and I'm running a 100% 12-ounce versus 16-ounce, that will have an impact during that period. We will – but we're sold out, I mean the volumes there. Your other question as it relates to, do we have the ability to gain efficiencies. I think labels make a bigger difference, especially when you're running full. And we've seen a lot – a greater willingness by some of our customers from an historical perspective. To get stuff on the shelves, they'll run fewer labels right now. And that is benefiting us from an efficiency standpoint. So, hopefully, that continues through the balance of the year. And as that continues, my 3% to 5% growth number may be impacted by that.
Brian Maguire: Okay. And then you talked about the opportunity to maybe move some cans from Mexico a little bit north. Just wondering if you'd see some increased freight along with that, and then Brazil obviously not running anywhere near normal operating rates, any – I know the freight is going to be pretty expensive, but any opportunities to move some stuff from there or even further north to the U.S. given how sold out you are?
Dan Fisher: I think that's a great question. And I think over the years – and I think I was just – we were – someone just mentioned pricing. One of the things to keep in mind is we have really done, I think, a solid job here over the last couple of years of restructuring our contracts in a way that puts the onus equal parts on our customers and us to forecast appropriately, to manage their supply chains. And so we're sharing in the risk. And one of the benefits of that is right now, if you're pulling more than you anticipated at the beginning of the year and we need to ship from Mexico, for instance, that freight burden doesn't lie on us. And so it's not price, but it's a relief of cost. And so yes, it's more cost, but it's more cost to the supply base, not necessarily Ball.
John Hayes: Yes. And your question about South America is a good one, and we are in active discussions with certain customers on does it make sense from an economic perspective to bring cans up from Brazil, but it's too premature to declare anything there.
Brian Maguire: Okay. Just last one, just real quick for me. On EMEA, I think you said 2Q will be down mid-single digits, but then just wondering what factors will cause that to flip to growth in the second half of the year. I think you indicated it should be up nicely or notably in the second half of the year.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I mean right now, most everything needs to be couched with. It all depends on what happens in shelter-in-place rules and social distancing. As those come off and as folks can return to normal purchasing patterns and getting back to work, the underlying fundamentals of our business in Europe would suggest we can grow, but until those fundamentals change, it's hard to know exactly what that looks like.
Brian Maguire: Alright. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Josephson: Good morning, everyone. Hope you and your families are well. John or Dan, just a question on the economic sensitivity of the beverage can markets in which you participate. It seems as if the U.S. is the least. You're having this mix issue, of course, with people not going to convenience stores as much, but nonetheless, your volumes held up quite well. Europe seems obviously more economically sensitive based on your comments about consumption taking a hit. And then Brazil, obviously, seems extremely economically sensitive. So can you just talk about the at-home versus on-premise mix by region, if possible? And then how economically sensitive you would characterize each market as?
Dan Fisher: I would agree with your comments in and around North America, full stop. I would catch maybe Europe and South America slightly different. And in particular, as channels aren't open and as folks aren't employed, and there's not as much of a social safety net in South America, Brazil in particular, that can create some pretty significant volatility in demand there. And the other thing to keep in mind, which I think everybody, understands pretty well, it's like the earnings profile also has quite a lot of tax associated with it. So when you're not running volume across your assets, you're also not able to take advantage of some of the tax benefit. So a little bit more sensitivity, I believe, in – excuse me, in South America because of that.
John Hayes: Yes. This is John. In terms of Europe, I don't necessarily – I don't think there's huge difference between North America and Europe. Really what it is is how the can is consumed.
Dan Fisher: Yes.
John Hayes: And where the impacts we're seeing right now, as Dan alluded to, is largely Southern Europe where that is a tourist trade. And there is no tourism going on right now. And so as the kiosks and what's called the HoReCa market where it's – effectively the convenience store, those are all shut down. And whether it's Italy, Spain, France, all along the Mediterranean, Turkey, we talked about, and that plays a very important part. Even in the U.K., which in the month of April has been soft, a lot of that has to do with urban city, i.e., London tourism. When you see people that take it home, we have not seen any trends that are fundamentally different than what we've seen in the past. Now there is less pantry stuffing, if you will, in Europe just from a cultural perspective, but it really has to do in Europe with the – how the beverage can is consumed in less with economic vitality of the individual consumer.
Adam Josephson: Thanks John and Dan. And one on Brazil, I mean, I think Ghansham referred to the fact that your volume growth there in recent years has been really extraordinary. I mean the industry has – just breathtakingly good, and then all of a sudden, it goes down 60%. Now it's leveled obviously down 20%, it sounds like. But how difficult is it to plan and manage that business given these really just extreme fluctuations in demand patterns there?
Dan Fisher: It's a great question. And just to be clear, the first 8 to 10 weeks, we still saw that accelerated growth rate trajectory in the entire region. I mean, candidly, the team down there – that's the environment over a 20-year period, the level of volatility, the ups and the downs.
Adam Josephson: Yes.
Dan Fisher: They're more nimble. We stretch our capital further. We're – we have a far greater and entrenched lean discipline there. One of the things that enables you to react more nimbly also, Adam, is there's far fewer customers that you're dealing with. And I think you're further embedded in their supply chains than maybe you see in Europe or North America, and that also allows you to move much quicker up and down in terms of adding or lessening capacity.
Adam Josephson: Thanks Dan, and Scott, just one last one on the receivables side. Obviously, someone earlier mentioned that you have some large customers that are pretty levered and have cut their dividends in some cases. Are you seeing any changes on the receivable side, and for that matter, on the payable side that may be marked differences from what you've normally experienced?
Scott Morrison: No. The large customers continue – we continue to operate business as usual with them.
Adam Josephson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Mark Wilde: Thanks, good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: First question I had is for Dan, and I just – one more on Brazil. You've got a beverage producer down there that's adding capacity, I think, a couple lines and then in line as well. Can you just help me think about how you expect that to help impact the market?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Good question. So, full stop, in the first 8 to 10 weeks and even in peak season, the entire market was short. So the market returns at the rates it was running, it needs more capacity. The other point is that particular customer of ours that you're talking about has stated that they're putting that project on hold, and the opening of that will be moved to the right given the current circumstances. So again, I think in many respects, it's needed because of the volume growth. And it still continues to be – we're seeing further can capacity invested in all the customer base, a movement from large-format glass and an acceleration toward the trends and the sustainability tailwinds, all throughout that region. So, I think it will be negligible.
Mark Wilde: Yes. Okay. Well, the real point is, it's not going to start up this year, and they'd be running at full and trying to displace other suppliers.
Dan Fisher: Correct.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's good. And then I wondered – Scott, there were a couple of special items in the quarter. One was a pretty significant goodwill write-down, and the other was a couple of items related to Ball Metalpack. And I wondered if you could talk about both of those.
Scott Morrison: Sure. The goodwill had to do with – as we moved – kind of reorganized other and moved to Turkey and Egypt into Europe, what was remaining in other – those other segments had goodwill that obviously those businesses are not as profitable. And so that's a cleanup of the goodwill related to those Saudi Arabian, Indian, those other businesses. And then on the Metalpack, we had an agreement – we currently make containers for them out of one of our beverage can plants, and we have the ability to, if you will, buy out that manufacturing agreement. And so we took the time – we chose to do that so that we can free up capacity in that plant a couple of years down the road to be able to produce more beverage cans in it versus food containers. And then we made – also both the partners in Metalpack made an advance into that business in the quarter.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Is there any potential you're on the hook for any other kind of capital in the Metalpack this year?
Scott Morrison: No. We don't have any obligation to do any capital contribution. This was voluntary and both partners felt it was in the best interest of the venture to do that.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Alright. And then the last one I had is for John Hayes. John, there's been some talk over the last probably four to six weeks about whether COVID is putting kind of plastic packaging in kind of new light potentially for some customers. Have you got any thoughts on that? Have you seen anything along those lines in your conversations?
John Hayes: No. There's been a variety of conversations. I think Dan hit it well. I think from a customer perspective over the long term, I do think nothing has changed at all from a sustainability point of view. In fact, even I think this past weekend, the Wall Street Journal had a big article about this topic. I think in the short-term, one could argue both sides of the coin. I think it's beneficial here in North America because cans and the shelf life relative to PET. On the other side of that, I know that the use of one-way bags, plastic bags in grocery stores as they've been – have more relief on that, you're not allowed to use reusable because of the COVID crisis. But I think that's more of a temporary thing. I do believe – personally, I do believe that this pandemic crisis is going to put on the forefront of people's minds about what we are doing in the world in which we live because the practices we perhaps have been employing are not sustainable over the long term. I think it's premature to declare it has had a profound impact one way or the other. But I do know – I can tell you this, our conversations with customers around long-term sustainability initiatives have not changed one iota relative to this. And then as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we even announced that our science-based targets have been approved by ASI. And so we continue to move forward, and I think it's going to be more important from a societal perspective as we go forward.
Mark Wilde: Okay. Just one kind of follow-up on that. Does the fact that we've got such kind of a crisis in the recycling industry here in North America and that a lot of this stuff is going into landfills rather than actually being recycled right now, how do you think about that issue?
John Hayes: I think of it – it is a ticking time bomb. It's just a function of when. We – this earth was not built to landfill things. And so I think the reuse, recycle concept is going to be more important. Now this whole reuse thing is being thrown into question because of how you can contract and how COVID is carried, but the recycling doesn't change at all. And because aluminum has economic value in the recycling system, I think it's important.  Getting back to the whole plastic side of it, I know there's a variety of people continuing to look at technologies, but they're much more costly than what's happening now. And it's much more costly than the aluminum can. And so given an environment where budgets are squeezed and people are focusing on cost, nothing has changed with respect to aluminum packaging in terms of the cost of that, but if you start to think about recycling is going to become more important, there is going to be added burden of cost on recycling plastic.
Mark Wilde: Okay, thanks. Good luck to the rest of the year guys.
John Hayes: Thank you. You to.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Leithead: Thanks guys and good morning. I'll just keep it to one because we're over the hour here, but just two of the factors you called out in your North American business, the SKU rationalization and more at-home consumption. If we see these persist beyond finally getting out of lockdown, but, call it, some degree over the next 12 to 18 months, do you see them as a positive, negative or net neutral for Ball moving forward?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think it's a long-term positive because what you will – I think there's a question post just more specifically in around – we've got 400 craft beer customers. The craft beer customers that are going to win throughout this have made can filling investments. They're not selling on-premise. They're not selling through kegs. They've got a portfolio that's much more sustainable and reliable. And so I think folks are going to – and even our large CSD customers, I think their view is the can will take a bigger percentage of their portfolio moving forward because it's more nimble, it's more agile. The shelf life is better. And so I view it as a positive sign. Whether it's 12-ounce cans, 16-ounce cans, 12 Sleek or whatever the can of the future is, it's going to be good in a macro sense for the can.
John Hayes: Rita, this is John Hayes. If there's one more question, we'll take that. And then given that we're so past the hour, we'll wrap up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Gabe Hajde: Good afternoon here on the East Coast. Thank you guys for taking the questions and I hope you and your family is doing well. I was hoping to maybe put a little bit of a more fine point on bev, North America, Central America. If I look at the volume growth, and I put a normalized 20% to 25% contribution margin on that, it leaves maybe $30 million of incremental profit improvement if I take into account, John, what you said about FX. So, is it fair to characterize this maybe half as price/mix and half from productivity, things like Goodyear performing better? And then I – [relatedly], there was a comment in your press release about dampened C-store and on-premise consumption and costs impacting price/mix. I would think most of this is isolated to mix component because pricing is kind of fixed at the beginning of the year. Can you confirm that and perhaps quantify the elevated costs through the remainder of the year? And if I'm limited to one, if I can ask Scott, do you have a targeted net debt or leverage target for the end of the year?
John Hayes: Dan, why don't you take the first one?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think if you refer back to – we were up $26 million-ish operating earnings year-over-year in North America, and there's easily another $15 million there relative to start-up costs and the exposure to foreign exchange. So yes, your comments in and around price/mix favorability, volume and better performance in the plants where we – I think we produce fairly sizably improved production units year-over-year for improved absorption even on the higher sales throughput. All of that's consistent with what your comments were.
John Hayes: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is we've made some good work on the improved efficiencies. We still have a long way to go.
Dan Fisher: Absolutely.
John Hayes: There's a lot of opportunity in front of us. And the additional costs, it's a little difficult to look out because we're in such a changing environment. We have higher – have had higher costs, our absenteeism was up. So the overtime that we are paying has been up. You think about all the benefits that we've been giving on top of everything as a result of COVID is another cost. We have had some out-of-pattern freight that has costs.  As Dan said, past times, it would have been 100% on us. It's not 0% on us. We're now splitting it with the customers. And so there's issues like that. It's not huge numbers, but over time it adds up. And if we had a better sense of what – I hate to use the term new normal, but what six months looks like in terms of protocols, safety protocols, people protocols and the demand, how that is shaping up, we'd have a much better ability to answer your question, but I think it's just – it's premature to answer that cost side.
Scott Morrison: And on the net debt to EBITDA, we'll still be in the range that kind of [3 to 3.5 range] by the end of the year.
John Hayes: Alright. Well, thank you all. We appreciate the time and thought it was important to give some extra time given the changes that are going on. I do, again, want to particularly thank our frontline workers, our customers, our suppliers and to the overall health care people out there. They are truly the heroes to all of us. So, I hope you all stay safe and well. Let's be very judicious in how people think about returning to a more normal environment, and we will keep you updated as we go forward. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, everyone, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode, afterwards we will have a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded today Thursday, February 6, 2020.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you Mladin and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's full year and fourth quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the company it could cause results or outcomes that differ in the company's latest 10 K and another company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our fourth quarter earnings release. It's available on our website at ball.com, information regarding the use of non GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as the reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we'll finish up with some comments on our aerosol and aerospace business as well as our outlook for the company. 2019 finished on a strong note with fourth quarter comparable operating earnings up 14%, diluted earnings per share up 29% and stronger-than-expected free cash flow. In contrast, EVA dollars generated on average invested capital were down slightly year-over-year as the significant growth capital recently deployed has not yet generated expected returns due to its infancy. We fully expect to generate meaningfully higher EVA dollars in '20 and beyond as multiple growth projects come online and we respond to significant multiyear growth in global beverage cans and as aerospace executes on their sizable backlog. Over the past year, global beverage volumes were up 5%. Our aerospace contracted backlog increased 14%. We completed the sale of two underperforming businesses. We launched our new aluminum cups business. Our full year comparable diluted earnings per share increased 15% and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders. As we reflect on 2019 and the 42-month integration plan and financial goals laid out following our mid-2016 acquisition of Rexam, I'm proud of our team, their ability to achieve more than $300 million in synergies and how well they've positioned our business to return significant value to all of our stakeholders over the near and long term. Back in 2016, when we completed the transaction, we laid out a 42-month target to achieve $2 billion in comparable EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow by year-end 2019. After taking into account the sale of our steel food can and steel aerosol businesses and the sale of our China beverage can assets, which combined represented approximately $110 million in anticipated 2019 EBITDA, and spending $100 million more in CapEx versus the original plan, our actual 2019 results were within $50 million of each financial goals. In addition to these strong results, we received $800 million in cash for the underperforming businesses we sold, which was used to further strengthen the balance sheet and return value to shareholders. The 42-month journey didn't happen exactly as envisioned in 2016. Our team learned where we needed to improve operationally and organizationally; how to leverage our strengths to ensure aluminum packaging is the most sustainable in the supply chain and create opportunity for us; that return-focused decisions to exit underperforming businesses, though difficult, are always the right thing to do. And most impressively, our team navigated a vast sea of external global, political and market changers to deliver for our shareholders. As we embark upon our 140 years in business and celebrate the 10th anniversary of our Drive for 10 vision, where we have already achieved our goals of doubling earnings per share, doubling free cash flow and doubling EVA dollars over the decade, our company has never been stronger. We know who we are. We know where we're going and we know what's important. In global aluminum beverage cans, we are leveraging the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity from a sustainability market leadership perspective and remain focused on operational excellence and an improved customer experience. In aerospace, we continue to grow without losing sight of the successful execution of our existing and future contracted backlog. In global aluminum aerosol, we continue to focus on innovation, sustainability, operational excellence and geographic expansion. And as a corporation, we are excited. We're excited to expand our newly launched aluminum cups business, guided by a defined go-to-market strategy as our new commercial production capacity comes on stream. We're excited to maintain our culture, EVA and ownership mindset and sustainability leadership while fostering an inclusive work environment and developing our next-generation of leaders and skilled trade professionals. We're excited to invest in growth opportunities across all of our businesses, more of which you'll hear from today. And we're excited to continue to onboard a cadre of new Ball people across our entire organization, ensuring that we preserve the old with the new, the values of our past with the ideas for tomorrow and the can-do spirit that has elevated Ball over 140 years. The year 2020 is shaping up to be quite strong with each business growing operating earnings. As customers, consumers, retailers and venues seek out our aluminum beverage packaging portfolio, our focus will be on amplifying our product sustainability benefits, operational excellence, improving customer service and executing on the various projects and commercial opportunities we have in front of us. Across the globe, we are actively investing in new aluminum packaging production to serve increasing demand for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. Dan and Scott will discuss these opportunities and the size of capital spending. Now key highlights for the fourth quarter include 9% specialty can growth. Today, specialty cans represent over 43% of our mix on a global basis. As anticipated, our overall global volume growth in the quarter was up low single digits given very tight supply conditions in North America, particularly for specialty cans, and tough year-over-year comps in Europe, where fourth quarter 2008 volumes were up over 10%. We closed on the remaining parts of the sale of our China business -- beverage can business and received the cash proceeds from the sale. We closed on the sale of our Argentina steel aerosol business. Our aluminum -- our new aluminum cup recently appeared in iconic venues such as the NFL Super Bowl as well as the Waste Management Phoenix Open. It will continue to expand into many major league and collegiate sports as well as music venues, followed by online and retail channels in 2021. In summary, while we had some short-term operational challenges and scrap headwinds in our North American business during 2019, we believe the scrap headwinds are behind us and our planned efficiencies are improving every day. Dan will go into that more. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of increasing EVA dollars and earnings over time through higher revenues above our cost growth, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, growing new innovative aluminum packaging products like the cup, and expanding aerospace, all with the return of value to our shareholders mindset. Thank you to all the people who work here at Ball for your passion, your great dedication and hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. Let me start with a few key points to set the stage for 2020 and beyond. Our market thesis of 4% to 6% volume growth over at least the next five years continues to hold true. The still water shift to cans is accelerating as conversations intensify in each of our major regions and will push demand growth to the higher end of the range if the overall supply chain can move at the rate the end consumer is demanding. In North America, the new customer contracts took effect on January one and additional contracts will renew in the coming years, and we will focus on getting paid for complexity while also improving our own operational efficiencies and ability to manage growth. In the first half of 2020, North American volume growth will be muted until new capacity comes online during the second half of the year. Global capacity expansions are on track and our team is focused on hiring and training to ensure successful ramp-ups. Given the expectation of high multiyear growth, discussions on securing additional aluminum supply are progressing. The ball aluminum cup is generating significant opportunities with a new customer base, and we are investing approximately 20 million in P&L costs in 2020. To enable the go to market strategy, we're looking forward to commercial cups coming out of our new Rome Georgia cups facility in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will initiate even more efforts to tell the aluminum sustainability story, not only as it relates to the infinitely recyclable nature of the package, but the superior CO2 footprint as well. This will further position bball as the partner of choice and inform the regulatory landscape going forward. Across our global operations, our team continues to manage tremendous growth, complexity, and incredibly tight supply demand conditions. As we prepare for the acceleration of products converting from PT to Cannes, we're well positioned and agile in our Europe and South American businesses and extremely focused on improving operational efficiencies, customer satisfaction and managing growth across our North American plant network. As our North American operations gain some breathing room, we'll be able to return to historical operational leverage on incremental sales. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North American segment volumes were up 2% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year with specialty cans growing 5% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. During 2019, the North American business underperformed relative to our expectations operationally. The underperformance largely emanated from Goodyear and their reliance on the other supply points nearby. The domino effect of operational pressures across our system was compounded by the tremendous demand in the Southwest supply orbit. In response to our underperformance in our U.S. operations, we made significant changes to the management team. We have confidence as we transition into 2020 based on the seasoned leaders and growth mindset being brought to our day-to-day focus. When the line additions at existing facilities in Georgia and Texas start up in the second half of 2020, and our Goodyear facility, which is now running at 75% efficiency gains even more momentum, this will certainly alleviate stress on the rest of the plant network. As previously announced, we will also construct two new specialty beverage can plants in Glendale, Arizona and in the Northeast U.S., both of which will initially have two can lines. Glendale is anticipated to come online in the first quarter of 2021 and the Northeast facility after that. Combined, the previously mentioned line and plant additions will produce six billion incremental units. With the aluminum scrap headwinds behind us, the progress being made at Goodyear and surrounding plants, previously negotiated contracts favorably resetting, I fully expect strong earnings momentum across North America in 2020 and beyond. Turning to our South American segment. Our volumes were up 3% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Year-over-year, quarterly earnings were up due to volume growth offset somewhat by customer mix. Our new plant in Paraguay started up on track and we are poised to add additional capacity in Brazil as growth warrants. Operating earnings are expected to improve year-over-year as Paraguay gains efficiencies, customers pursue more specialty cans and more favorable approach to customer mix enhances results. European beverage earnings were up 9% in 2019 due to volume growth and improved operational performance despite $16 million of unfavorable operating earnings translation impact during the year. Volumes were flat in the fourth quarter, largely due to tough comps and year-end positioning between customers and retailers. For the year, volumes were up 5% in Europe. We are leveraging our continental Europe network to add lines to existing facilities in preparation for our customers' growth following the installation of additional can filling lines and to support normal market growth across Continental Europe and Russia. More to come as we move through the year. As we mentioned in today's earnings release and following the recent decision to close our Dubai office, the company's existing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Manisa, Turkey will be consolidated into the existing beverage packaging Europe segment starting in first quarter 2020. Given that the vast majority of the legacy EMEA business is associated with these two plants, it should be relatively easy to understand the changes in this segment going forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be prioritizing capital and resources for the best long-term outcomes. Following the Dubai office closure and the slowdown of our business in Saudi Arabia, we are shifting the management responsibilities of our Egyptian and Turkish plants to our European team in the U.K., and the remaining Indian and Saudi facilities will continue to be reported in other nonreportable going forward along with cups. In summary, global beverage can demand momentum continues in the regions where we operate. Going forward, I see North and Central America's three- to five-year forward volume growth CAGR in the range of 4% to 6%; South America's three- to five-year forward volume growth CAGR in the range of 5% to 8%; and Europe's three- to five-year forward growth CAGR in the range of 3% to 6%. Our teams are actively hiring to support our anticipated growth. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. Our time is now. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable fourth quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share were $0.71. In the full year, it was $2.53 versus $0.55 and $2.20, respectively, in 2018. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-K. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid global beverage can shipments, strong aerospace performance, a lower share count, lower effective tax rate and lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses, sale of our Chinese assets, euro earnings translation headwinds and higher interest expense. In addition, global beverage revenues for the fourth quarter were down 4% from the pass-through of lower cost aluminum and roughly an $80 million year-over-year impact from the fourth quarter sale of our Chinese beverage can assets. Net debt ended the year right on target at $6 billion. The company completed a successful Eurobond issuance in November of 2019, which resulted in favorable rates and a larger-than-typical cash balance at year-end. In January 2020, we redeemed the 3.5% and 4.375% 2020 senior notes. Ball's balance sheet is healthy. Debt has been termed out at low rates, and we maintain ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs. In 2019, we generated $950 million of free cash flow after spending $250 million of maintenance capex and an additional $350 million in growth capex. We also funded $216 million into our pension plans, which was $125 million higher than our original plan and generated more than $200 million in working capital. We completed net share repurchases of $945 million and paid $182 million of dividends, returning an excess of $1.1 billion to shareholders. In the quarter, interest expense was a little higher due to the carrying cost of the Eurobond placement at year-end, and corporate undistributed finished the year slightly lower than expected at $54 million. As we look to 2020, here are some key metrics to keep in mind. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 20%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $280 million and full year corporate undistributed will be in the range of $70 million as we provide for higher benefits and incentives in 2020. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be this strong. We will be investing in working capital to support our growing businesses and $550 million of growth capex during the year. We anticipate full year 2020 capex in the range of $800 million resulting in free cash flow of approximately $600 million. Given the growth in operating earnings and our strong cash flow, we also plan to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders in 2020. Like always, we will invest capital with an eye on EVA returns, manage our balance sheet effectively and consistently repurchase stock and pay dividends for the benefit of our long-term shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business, global volumes were down in the quarter and were up slightly in 2019. European volume softness and operational performance dampened full year segment earnings. We have initiated action plans to improve operational performance in our facilities and believe the volume shortfall at the end of the year will not carry over into 2020. We recently launched our new Infinity bottle. This refillable, reclosable and infinitely recyclable aluminum bottle can provide a sustainable solution for shampoos, lotions and other personal care products as they shift from small- to medium-sized plastic containers at hotels and on store shelves. In addition, we continue to see operations to broaden our global footprint through bolt-on M&A. We look forward to improving the business performance in 2020 and beyond. In 2019, our aerospace business reported 24% revenue and operating earnings growth on very solid contract performance. Our year-end backlog increased 14% and our head count in 2019 increased by over 1,000 employees. Executing on our backlog and providing our employees exciting work and enhance infrastructure for office space testing and manufacturing are the areas of focus in 2020. Looking forward, the program's recently won are vital to the intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance, as well as the climate change in weather predictive prediction needs of our country. With the recent budget agreement between Congress and the White House. Some of the ambiguity around contract start-up has been de risked. The business should be able to grow operating earnings in excess of 15% per year over the next several years, given the scale and type of contracted backlog recently one. In addition, there are even greater future program opportunities that we're pursuing that would position us even further into the future. Our long term prospects have never been brighter. wallets uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global aluminum, packaging, and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders. We look forward to driving our business to deliver long term diluted earnings-per-share growth of at least 10 to 15% per year, and achieve or even $1 growth goals of four to 8% per year and larger invested capital base, we will continue to responsibly invest both internally and externally. enable new products improve our existing businesses, position and train talent effectively while maintaining our culture and EPA discipline. And always, we will do what is best for Ball, our employees, our communities and our shareholders' long-term success. And with that, Mladin, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. You indicated last year that in North American bev, you could get, I think, $30 million in inefficiencies rolling off and then $40 million in scrap recovery this year. Is that still accurate with the sold-out conditions in specialty cans kind of continuing into the second half of the year? And then in terms of the cadence, in terms of quarters for inefficiencies to roll off, and then for scrap, do all those contracts just reset on Jan 1? Or any kind of color you could give there on the timing?
Scott Morrison: Sure. Yes. The numbers you started with are still -- you're actually correct in terms of the scrap. We've largely offset that. That starts in, really, January 1. So that about -- that's already started to benefit us. So you see a nice improvement in the first quarter. The manufacturing efficiencies, we continue -- as Dan mentioned, we continue to get better and those will get better as we move through the year. And the start-up costs, really, we had very little start-up costs in the fourth quarter in North America. Now as we start to get closer to the start-up of the new plants that we're talking about and some of the new lines in the second half of the year, we'll have some start-up costs related to that. But all of that in total, if you put all that together, earnings in that business should be up kind of low to mid-teens.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just shifting to Europe.
Scott Morrison: Sorry. Yes. I meant low to mid-teens on a percentage basis, just to be clear.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And then just shifting to Europe. I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces with the retail positioning you called out and Egypt and Turkey being added to the segment, and you've had some start-up costs. Is it possible to kind of size the sort of run rate earnings power of Europe right now or how we should think about the segment in 2020? Just if you can give any more detail on those kind of moving pieces.
Scott Morrison: Sure. So Europe should be up low teens without the benefit of the EMEA businesses. And if you look at the EMEA businesses and the profitability there, the vast majority of the profitability came from the two plants that we're moving from the EMEA business into Europe, so Turkey and Egypt. There was very little profitability from the other business that will go to the other segment. And so if you think of moving the EMEA profitability into Europe on top of those low teens improvement that we expect in operating earnings, that should give you your numbers.
Dan Fisher: Just a little more color on that. Very similar operating margins on a percent-of-sales basis that's been included in the business. So we'll still be thinking of kind of the normal flow-through. There shouldn't be regional mix implications, in other words, going forward. If we get the growth, you should see traditional or historical flow-through.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it? That's, that's perfect. I'll turn it over.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Neel Kumar: Great. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the 4% to 6% volume growth, is that a Ball-specific figure or for the overall market? And then can you just give us some more insight on what you would need to see in the supply chain to get to the high end? And then you also mentioned a comment about still water conversions. What kind of impact do you specifically think that can have on growth? And can you just update us on some of those conversations you've been having?
Dan Fisher: Yes. The first question relative to the 4% to 6%, that is relative to the markets that we operate in today, and that's what we believe when we're looking at the next five to seven years. I think I indicated in the script, five years, we're doing a seven-year plan. So anything outside of five years would be really difficult for us to comment right now in terms of contracts and some of the conversations we're having with retailers and customers. And then your second question is the most difficult to answer in and around still water. I will tell you the conversations that we're having, certainly, the growth is nice up from the low base in both Europe and in North America, but we're also having much different conversations even in South America as we speak, and we're talking to some of the larger brands. I expect to see some of this showing up on retail shelves in all of the regions we're at. But in terms of what price point that's at, the velocity of the turnovers and what it means in terms of aggregation of volume within the next three to five years, that's a difficult one for us to answer. The conversations are certainly far more robust today than they were this time a year ago. I look forward to giving you more updates through the quarters as we see more of these products show up on retail shelves, and we have a little bit more data at our disposal.
Neel Kumar: Yes. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you talked about a focus on improving operational excellence in 2020. In terms of your new capacity expansions in North America, can you just talk about what you're planning to do differently to ensure a smoother ramp-up and maybe avoid some of those issues you had recently with the two last lines at Goodyear, particularly as it relates to workforce training?
Dan Fisher: Sure. I mean, we're definitely spending a lot -- we're spending a lot more time. We're hiring earlier for the new start-ups, and we're training in a lot more detail. We're also combining the mix of folks that are going into these new facilities and/or the new lines are going to be a combination of external hires and then repositioning folks from other plants. So I think that's going to give us a little bit more security as to the ability for folks to run the way we need to run with the amount of complexity we have in our businesses. And fundamentally, I think the leadership team that we have now in place is -- it's best-in-class, and they're doing a lot of really solid fundamental things to get us basically focused on kind of what we need to do in delivering to our customers. I do think getting Goodyear running and securing that orbit of seven to eight plants being impacted will -- that will certainly help us. And then the last thing that I know John has talked about in previous calls that you can't undervalue is we're not only stepping into better economics and derisking some of these scrap issues and these new contracts. We have much tighter order fences, and that's going to allow us to operate with a much clearer path one week out, two weeks out, and all of that is going to have as much of an impact, candidly, as some of the training and some of the focused efforts are going to be.
Operator: Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi, Baird, please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey guys, good morning. Can we just go back to Europe for a minute? Just give us some more color as to why volumes were flat for you. I mean, you mentioned a tough comp from a year ago but I think the industry was still up at a healthy rate. Was there a specific customer mix that impacted you? And then second, it looks like Carlsberg is looking at -- potentially looking at seltzers in the European market given that it's very small relative to the boom we're seeing here in the U.S. Can you just touch on capacity utilization in the industry in Europe, just broadly speaking?
Dan Fisher: Yes. So I think the first comment relative to our growth compared to the region, yes, the region was up. We did make some conscious decisions in terms of our customer portfolio, walk from some business in the Southeast Europe region. So that did contribute to that but we really like the short- and medium-term opportunities that will be stepping in to replenish that volume. So we should see growth trajectory kind of second, third, fourth quarter, getting closer to probably market trends in Europe for us. The utilization in the entire European market, I know for us, we're in the 95% to 97% utilization range. We're making some incremental investments, debottlenecking where we can, but we're certainly running incredibly tight right now. I would think that the market in general is in that 93% to 95% range. There is still -- there are still pockets of volume. It's not near as tight as we're seeing in Brazil and/or North America, but certainly, 93% to 95%. We would historically have said that is a tight market in a full market. We're just operating in a much tighter supply demand intensity level right now in most of our regions because of the growth profile.
John Hayes: Carlsberg?
Dan Fisher: Seltzer market will -- it's probably not just Carlsberg. I would express -- expect the seltzer market to transition into Europe. Of course, I was over in Europe two weeks ago and nobody knows what the heck a seltzer is. So it will be interesting to see how that transition manifests, but I would expect after some of the key players in North America get their installed base and their supply chain built out to take advantage of what they think the real longer-term opportunity is for seltzers, they will all focus their attention on that marketplace.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. That's really helpful. And then last quarter, Dan, I apologize if I -- if you talked about this, but you said that you would leverage Q4 to basically rebuild inventory levels in North America for 2020 just to give your operations a bit of breathing room. Can you just update us on how successful you are with that initiative? And also, can you just comment on backlogs occurring specific to North America? And how are you kind of managing production for next year just given the surge in demand?
Dan Fisher: Sure. I think we largely accomplished what we wanted to in terms of inventory build. Of course, whether or not we built the right things, that will be dependent on the end consumer and what they draw. I think for North America, next year, we've got a number of projects, a couple of them pretty significant, that are going to show up and give us more capacity in Q2 and Q3. Those are really what we need to come off in order to kind of maintain the requisite delivery levels we need to our customers and kind of eliminate some of the disruption we saw in the previous years from a tight market.
John Hayes: Yes. Ghansham, this is John. I'll just put an exclamation point on what just Dan said because we have these lines starting up in the second half of this year. So over the first half of this year, we're going to get some incremental capacity but it's in the range of $0.5 billion or so. It's really in the third and fourth quarter each, that's when we're going to get another $0.5 billion additional each quarter. And so it is going to continue to be tight. We've said that, but it's going to be tight for the first half of this year. But then as we move through, I think, this new investment as well as getting more efficient on that orbit that Dan talked about, that's when you'll really start to see it.
Operator: And next question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America, please go ahead.
George Staphos: Everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on 2019's progress. Hey, I wanted to maybe piggyback on Ghansham's question on Europe. So given what looks to be -- and ultimately, an improving supply demand balance as the market should continue to grow, are there reasons why you wouldn't see Europe over time evolving into what you see in North America and South America from a supply demand standpoint and some of the ancillary benefits you'd get from a commercial standpoint and innovation standpoint?
John Hayes: Yes. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. And just, again, to provide more color about what Dan said is we are operating -- we, at least, are operating in a tight investment. I can't comment on anyone else, but we are faced with a decision whether we would contract under a longer-term basis some business or choose to walk away from it. We chose to walk away from it because we have belief in the growth of the market, and we are -- given that we're already tight that we think we can fill up that capacity in the very short term. So I wouldn't read into the fourth quarter volume much at all. And what we're trying to do on a global basis, the same things you have heard us talk about for the last three years or so, which is leveraging the footprint we have, focusing on specialty and be able to deliver to our customers on the right economic terms anything they need, wherever, whenever. That's our goal. And we believe, although we now need to execute and show up, but we believe we're in a good place in North America. And we believe, with a little bit of time, we've now gotten our footprint in a place in Europe that we feel pretty good about it, and now we're deploying that strategy that we believe we've been successful in North America into the European marketplace.
George Staphos: I wanted to try to, to the extent possible, parse some of the capacity and growth figures that you put out either in the formal comments today or in the press release. So on the one hand, you talked about, I think, eight billion units of capacity going in through 2021. And then I think I heard earlier on the call something around six billion units in terms of cans, in terms of cans -- plants, excuse me, and lines going in. Did I hear that and connect that correctly? And would that suggest that much of the majority in that gap where that delta would be aluminum cups? And if that's true, how is that tracking relative to what your expectation would have been, say, three and six months ago?
Dan Fisher: A good question. The six billion was North America specific. And so the delta between eight billion and six billion is not cups. Less -- more of the capacity is going into South America and some incremental in Europe. So I'd say almost all of the eight billion, close to all of the eight billion is can capacity.
John Hayes: Yes. And further, George, that's what we've announced as well, and we've told the world as we go forward, we're monitoring this very closely. So we could continue to -- that eight billion could become larger as opportunities present themselves.
Dan Fisher: Yes.
George Staphos: Relatedly, within that $800 million of capex, I would assume your projects that you haven't announced yet, that possibly could come to fruition. Would that be fair?
Scott Morrison: Most -- really, that $800 million is everything that we've announced publicly so far.
George Staphos: Okay. My last couple, and I'll turn it over quickly. One, on free cash flow, the performance was very strong, at least by your standards even. What went so well for you on working capital where there was a real nice swing? What was so negative in other free cash flow? There was a fairly large -- I think it was over $100 million swing there year-on-year. What was behind that? And then back to the growth, and I'll leave it here, in that eight billion, is there a way to parse what you think is related to plastic conversion?
Scott Morrison: So on the working capital, really, our operations and our GBS operations that are -- just a tremendous job of collecting everything. We have probably the lowest past dues we've ever had in our history at the end of the year. So really just great work on that front. Great work on the aerospace receivables as well. So it's really across the businesses, how well we perform. And the big negative in the other would be the incremental pension funding that we did in excess of the expense. That's the vast majority of that number, George.
Dan Fisher: And your question on parsing out the incremental investment in the capacity installation as it relates to sustainability, I'm not a rocket scientist, but how we're looking at it is, historically, we've grown at 2% to 3% and we think we're doubling that. So probably 50%, maybe even a smidge more is probably related directly to what we believe is sustainability.
John Hayes: Yes. George, it's a great question. As you know, we try and track this as best we can. And the best data point we can give you is in North America. Three years ago, 1/3 of all new products coming out were in cans. Today, it's 70%. That's a meaningful jump. And so I think new brands, as they think about launching their beverages, they think about -- the difficulty is starting a brand, number one. The difficulty of getting product placement, number 2, and then do they want to go into the headwind called this anti-plastic regime. And so I do think, although that's the best anecdotal facts we can give you, anything else is speculative.
Operator: Next question is from Tyler Langton with JP Morgan, please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Morgan. Thank you, Scott, I think, could you just help us bridge, I guess, the -- or understand the components a little bit better of the 2020 free cash flow guidance? I think you said free cash flow of $600 million and then maybe capex of $800 million. Just if you have any more details on sort of pension funding or cash taxes, interest expense, just sort of how to think about the components of that number?
Scott Morrison: Sure. So pension funding, we had a -- we'll have a pretty big swing year-over-year, which will be a benefit of about $125 million from '19 to '20, less funding into our plans in '20. Working capital, with our growing businesses, we need to invest some into working capital. So a good starting point for that number, probably $150 million use of investment in working capital. Taxes, cash taxes really won't change a heck of a lot. Those are kind of the big -- those are the big components, really.
Tyler Langton: And then I don't know, I mean, I know it's looking out to 2021, so a whiles away. But I guess, just with the sort of the capacity that you've planned, I mean do you have a sense in terms of how capex and working capital could then look just sort of relative to 2020?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think, as opposed to a couple of years ago, we had said $500 million to $600 million was a good longer-term bogey. I think it's going to definitely be higher than that and it could be on the range of what we're going to spend in '20, also in '21. We're seeing a lot of growth opportunities. I think we're at the early stages of a lot of the sustainability growth that we're seeing and things that are going into cans. So I think it will be at an elevated level. We're really in a growth mode. This business for a long time wasn't in a growth mode. And so I think we have to get used to both internally and externally of looking at our company differently than we have in the past. And we've got great opportunities in front of us. So I'm really excited about the growth and the investments that we're going to make.
John Hayes: Yes. And that's -- what Scott just described is based on conversations and detailed discussions with our customers. Dan had mentioned a lot on the still water side, but it's in every single category I can think of right now. We're having pro can discussions with our customers and what that means in terms of contractual commitments, etc.
Tyler Langton: Great. And then just, I guess, just a final question. In terms of the volume growth, I guess it seems like in a lot of the regions, sort of first half of this year is going to be a little bit weaker. Can you just kind of, I guess, I think, direction on sort of how the cadence of volume growth should look as sort of the capacity comes online throughout the year?
Dan Fisher: In North America and Europe, your comment is correct. You should see kind of more of a second half lift when capacity comes online. And in South America, it should be pretty steady growth throughout the year because we did an awful lot last year, got Paraguay up and running, did some investments in Chile and Argentina. So we're doing some of those efforts now in North and Central America and in Europe. And so ongoing, you'll see greater growth rates in the second half of the year in Europe and North America and then building on that in 2021.
Tyler Langton: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc, please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Scott, just a couple more on the free cash flow. If I heard you right, you're expecting a working capital swing of about $400 million because it was a source of $236 million and a drag in '19 and a drag of $150 million this year. Just to be clear on the $236 million, was there any increase in factoring in that number? Are you anticipating any particular change in factoring? And then by the end of '20 in terms of the working capital drive that you're expecting, do you think your working capital will be at a stable level thereafter?
Scott Morrison: In terms of factoring, nothing different than what we had originally built into our plan. So really, the outperformance in the working capital had to do with way better collections at the end of the year and some things we did in aerospace even in collections. So it wasn't -- it was less about factoring than it was about other real performance improvements. In terms of going forward, if our business continues to grow like it is, and the cups -- and remember, we're going to ramp the cups business. They will start producing at the end of '20, but really start really ramping in '21. So I could see more growth and more investment needed in the working capital to support the growth in our businesses.
Adam Josephson: Just on the pension, Scott, so it will be a source of $125 million. How funded are your plans at this point? And do you expect to have to make contributions post 2020?
Scott Morrison: Well, we'll have to make -- yes, we have active plans. So we'll continue to make contributions, but we had extra cash flow, very strong cash flow in '19. That's why we funded an incremental amount of the plans in '19. We'll fund about $90 million into the plans in 2020. But we're in pretty good shape from a funding standpoint.
Adam Josephson: Okay. And just one on -- back to the European conversion situation for a second. Can you just kind of elaborate on how many customers -- and forgive me if I missed this, how many still water customers in Europe you're talking about, Dan, in terms of adding capacity for -- and roughly kind of how many cans those conversions represent based on what you're talking about for '20 and beyond?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head. I would say that still water will be a bigger impact in North America moving forward than Europe.
John Hayes: Yes. It's too difficult to quantify because we're talking with the biggest brands and start-up brands and everything in between. And I think just when you look at the overall absolute amount of still water, the consumption trends in a year in the United States are probably greater than they are in Europe.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs, Please go ahead.
Brian Maguire: Hey, good morning, guys. Dan, thanks for the comments on the three- to five-year growth CAGRs by region. Just this has kind of been asked a little bit already, but just to be clear on that, you're not expecting or you don't need to see a material pickup in this trend toward plastic substitution to hit those. Do you think that's just relying on kind of continuing existing markets and existing trends you're seeing and anything you got from still water would be gravy to those numbers?
Dan Fisher: Exactly. Yes. And when we're talking about still water, I mean, even in our 4% to 6%, we're talking about the premiumization end of it. We're not talking about the full 500 billion single-serve plastic water bottles around the world. It's the very high end of that. Yes. We are not seeing significant conversions on the base brands. We don't need that. Just referencing John's KPI that we're looking at, it's just the new product launches are disproportionately going into cans, and that is accelerating our growth trends. So we look forward to the base brand shifting, but that's not incorporated in kind of our growth assumptions at this point.
Brian Maguire: Okay, great. I just wanted to come back to the aluminum cup a little bit. I think you said you're spending -- it sounded like $20 million of opex investments in 2020 to support it? Is that -- did I hear that right?
Dan Fisher: That's right.
Brian Maguire: And is that mostly marketing and promotional spending, R&D? Or can you kind of just give a little bit more color or details on where those costs are kind of are?
Dan Fisher: Sure. Yes. But I'd say 30% of it is what you just characterized, and then even in that, we've got to hire somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 and 120 folks to run our facilities. So you've got some of the investment cost, pre-spend and training that's also in that number.
John Hayes: But just to give you a sense, as we sit here right now, we've already hired marketing and new business folks for not only the arena side of the business but also the go-to-market in terms of retail. So those are the types of carrying cost, opex that we're talking about.
Brian Maguire: Okay. And just last one for me. Just the reclassification of the facilities in Turkey and Egypt, if it makes sense, given the size and scale of what's going on in the Middle East. But do you think there will be some opex or cost-cutting opportunities from that and/or opportunities to maybe move that volume, mix it up by moving it into other regions from there?
John Hayes: This is John. There -- on one hand, yes. On the other hand, no. What -- we've actually closed the Dubai office, but remember, over the last three years, we significantly downsized that. So there's nothing material. The Saudi market, as we sit here right now, is not a very healthy market and that's probably a little -- not necessarily a headwind relative to 2019 but there really isn't -- we don't see any upside to that, whereas you compare to what we've seen over the last couple of years in Turkey and Egypt, there's probably some operational upside to that. But in the grand scheme of things, this was not a cost-cutting play. This is an ability to focus on what's important.
Operator: Next question is from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead.
Mark Wilde: Good morning. Dan, I wondered if you could start off. I had always understood the South American beverage can market to be almost completely a beer market, and it sounds like you're seeing other beverages move into cans down there. Could you just give us a sense of sort of how big that non-beer segment is right now and what you think the trajectory is?
Dan Fisher: That's a great question. I mean, it's overwhelmingly a beer market. We anticipate it to be overwhelmingly a beer market going forward, at least in the next three to five years. There are pockets of opportunity, but a lot of our -- a lot of our growth opportunity even in South America is -- it's actually more beer more than anything, and that's because it's transitioning out of returnable glass or one-way glass. The other side of the business, I do think still water will be an opportunity. I mean, we're seeing pockets. Energy drinks are probably going to be a bigger growth area and an area of focus for all of the large global players. It's a big juice market. We've got some filling challenges there but we're working on some technologies that may open up those markets. But I think going forward, 80% of that market is beer and there's still a lot of can penetration and can growth available to us. If something really opens up like still water, I think we're poised with our system to take advantage of that. But how we're looking at that market is continued strong growth in beer, continued substrate penetration by cans into returnable glass, and that trajectory looks pretty healthy for the next three to five years.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then you made some comments about kind of additional can sheet capacity in North America. Can you just put a little more color around that?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I think we've commented on this off and on probably over the last 18 months. And one of the things that we've spent a lot of time, the folks on this call, are stimulating a base, a supply base in North America not only to derisk us from the ongoing -- the volatility in tariffs, etc, with all the excess capacity of can sheet being in China but stepping into growth and making sure we have a much more agile and nimble supply chain in North America. Those conversations are starting to really take a very positive form. And I would say that whereas a lot of the rolling mills and the can sheet providers were seeing a lot of benefits on the automotive side, that's still there for them. But suddenly, can sheet's looking a heck of a lot more attractive at a nice growth rate, and I think there's more profitability in this when they really look at it intentionally. And so I feel comfortable that over the next 18 to 24 months, we'll start to see some investments, maybe not significant, but enough to kind of manage the -- assure the supply for more cans and more PET substrate shift into cans.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then last one for me. You just -- you mentioned being more proactive on the sort of carbon footprint argument. And one of the big beverage company's CEOs did an interview in the fourth quarter and he was really making the case for plastics again on a carbon footprint basis. So I wondered if you could just provide us with your perspective on that whole issue.
John Hayes: Yes, this is John. Let me kind of jump into that. I know over the next coming weeks and months, you're going to be reading about some independent third-party LCAs that actually show the exact opposite. It is true that if -- on an LCA basis, if you're using 100% virgin aluminum in it, that the carbon footprint is higher. But the reality is over 70% of all aluminum cans produced in the world today, 70% of that aluminum is recycled content. When you look at the facts and you put that in, it is lower than PET, lower than glass and lower than cartons, full stop, because of the infinitely recyclable nature of it. We, as an industry over the last 20 years, have not done a good job of articulating this as clearly as we should. And I think over the coming weeks, months and years, you're going to hear a lot more because I think the world is inundated with facts that aren't based in reality. And when you base the facts on reality, the can will stand up and will be better than any other beverage package on a CO2 perspective.
Operator: And the next question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays, Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Morning, I guess, to start, first, the industry question, kind of similar to one of George's questions. But I was just wondering if you had any sense of how much of the industry volume growth you think is being driven by new categories or offerings by the beverage companies versus just purely like-for-like packaging substrate shift. I know it's an inexact science, but any color you think you have would be great.
Dan Fisher: So I think we probably parsed this out among the regions because they're all a little different. I'd say the growth rates in Europe of 5% versus, historically, 3%, that lift is almost 100% sustainability-driven, at least we believe. We can't point to any specific KPI. But when we look at still water growth and some of the other products moving out of their existing substrate into cans, that feels like real inertia and sustainability. In North America, the doubling of our growth rate is probably comprised of two things: one, its sustainability and has a lot to do with what John's indicated and what we've said here, which 1/3 of all new product introductions three years ago were in cans, and today, it's running at a 70% clip. The other thing that's happened in North America is spiked seltzers went into cans, and so that was a big help for us over the last couple of years. I would expect that growth to continue at similar rates for the next couple of years. But at some point, that will meter off, and then we'll be left with new products being introduced, and hopefully, those are going to win. Chances are we're going to get the winners in cans. And then sustainability, especially in the still water area, that will be almost 100%. That category, we can look at that and say that is substrate shift. In South America then, we haven't seen sustainability as strongly as we've seen it in North, Central America and in Europe. But what we are seeing is returnable glass and one-way glass in the beer space, in particular, shifting into cans. Some of that is new product introductions. They're using 100% malt, and the transition out of corn-based beers, we've seen that. The premiumization in there is one-way packaging and one-way can packaging. So that is -- that's new product introductions and returnable glass shift continues in a big way in Brazil, Chile and in Argentina.
Mike Leithead: Got it. That color is really helpful. And then just second one, a question on the aerospace business, an area that's seen tremendous growth the past couple of years for you guys and you expect it to continue growing double digits going forward. So I guess, are you seeing any bandwidth constraints on that business's growth? I mean, I know you're mostly cost plus on your contract base. But I just mean logistically being able to handle a business that's grown this fast, is that impeding the growth rate at all?
John Hayes: No. I don't think so. Our management team has done a terrific job. I mean, when you think about bandwidth issues, I think of people and facilities. And we've been spending a fair amount. If you come out here to Colorado, you will see the growth that you've seen in our various three campuses, aerospace campuses from a facilities point of view. And the amount of new manufacturing capability, engineering capability and just, quite frankly, office space, that's one of the reasons why our corporate headquarters is a temporary office right now because we moved out to the aerospace, could accommodate the growth there. I think on the people side, we've been growing -- we've been hiring 1,000 people a year for the last couple of years, and we've done a tremendous job of making sure that we're hiring the right people, that we're bringing them on from day one, six months in, two years and making sure that they have the appropriate training. And as we go forward, this is critical because we're still expecting to hire another 1,000 this year. After that, it's probably premature to describe anything, but we've been able to create a very well-oiled machine in the aerospace business for on-boarding our people. And quite frankly, some of the conversations Dan was talking about in terms of beverage can, we've had our HR folks talking with our aerospace folks to make sure that there's lessons learned going across the organization. So when I think of bandwidth issues, I think of facilities and people, and we've been doing a very good job. Our management team has been doing a very good job on both of those.
Operator: Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets, Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Good morning. Just a couple of questions to tie up some loose ends. The other segment, how are you guys looking at that both on a quarterly basis and for the full year post the moving of the EMEA business and maybe that situation with aerosol? How should we think about the P&L contribution from that segment?
Scott Morrison: Yes. It's going to be pretty small. If you take out and move to Turkey and Egypt plants and their profitability into Europe, there's not much profitability left in the other segment. And then when you think about what we're going to be spending money on, cups will show up there as well. I'm sorry, cups is going to show up in -- yes, in the other segment. So it's going to be relatively consistent throughout the year but at a lower level.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, I'm just curious, food, obviously, it's been sold and you don't really mention it anymore, but anything that would track off, I guess, as we go through the year?
John Hayes: No. This is John. We have a minority interest in that. And so as we go forward, we think we've partnered with the right folks. We think that industry is in need of consolidation, rationalization. That was our thesis all along, and we brought a partner in to help us think through that. It's premature to talk about anything that could happen in that business. But -- so it's playing out as we expected it to, and there's not any real news to report.
Arun Viswanathan: And then just lastly, there's been a number of projects in beverage can in North America that's been announced. There's probably a couple more that are coming in the next couple of months. I guess, I'll just bring up the question again around capacity. Are you guys at all worried about returns here and potential oversupply? Or do you think that's not really a concern at this point?
John Hayes: It's not a concern at this point. In fact, the concern is making sure we have enough cans to supply the overall market, and the reality is there is going to be new capacity. We don't know anything other than what we're doing. We're aware of that announcement by that independent down in Florida that actually -- most of it's going into the Caribbean market, but the market is growing at a rate very fast. And so we're just trying to keep our proportional share and grow with that market and try and win in the places that we can win relative to our skill sets. But there's going to be more capacity coming on, and that's actually a good thing because that means the can is growing. And as Dan said, our viewpoint isn't a two or three-year viewpoint. This is a long-term point of view.
Operator: Thanks. And our next question is from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
Debbie Jones: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, are there any broader themes that you're seeing when you talk to your customers about the type of can that they want, whether it be in kind of the new category growth or shifts due to sustainability? And what does that mean for the way you ramp up capacity? And is there any technology that you are working on that you think would be additive to this?
Dan Fisher: Good question, Debbie. I'd say on the -- in the area of still water, in particular, that is going to -- I could see a big play for 12-ounce standard cans, depending on what retail channel and what price point and where these sit. I would say the predominant can right now, our can conversations everywhere in the world, are your 12 sleek and your 16-ounce can, different variants to those. We are looking at a number of different innovations in different markets. This is one, though, I don't see a uniform exchange through all of the regions. But as John said this, and I think we believe this too, if we're making 40 can sizes in North America today, in the next five years, we'd love to be making 80. And we think we can do that better than anybody else and it will give the customers choice. It will give the retailers and our customers an opportunity to improve their margins. And so those are the conversations we're having across the board. There will be more opportunities to give you a little bit more color. But some of the bigger customers, we're talking to marketeers and brand managers for categories and flavor profiles. We haven't had conversations for decades, and those are going to open up all sorts of innovative conversations and different can sizes and formats, etc. So 12 standard is still going to have a place. It's still a growing pack size because of the sustainability mix, but I think overwhelmingly, specialty will continue to take the new product introductions, the new category expansions and the new launches. Those will all come in specialty containers.
Debbie Jones: Okay. And then my second question, is there a point at which, with the 4% to 6% growth I think you pointed to for the next couple of years, is there a point at which you can kind of shift into just adding lines at these various facilities to kind of fulfill that growth? Is that what you're modeling toward? Or do you expect that it's just going to be a continuation based on your current footprint of needing to build the new greenfield facility?
Dan Fisher: Great question. I think depending on the size of the market and where the orbit is that we're building, we are absolutely trying to create more modular incremental thinking off of an anchor investment. So we would like to be able to take 2-line can plants to three and four. Well, that's a heck of a lot easier to do than to stand up 2-line can plants. But it'll depend on where the region is, the customer or the category, all of that will dictate probably size and scale to some extent.
John Hayes: Yes. And Debbie, if you go back by region, what we've tried to do is fill out the -- as best we can, the existing bricks and mortar. And I think about when we acquired the South American business, it was a series of 1-line facilities and we rationalized and consolidated that to a point and invested in that with very little new bricks and mortar. Same thing we've done in Europe and even here in the U.S. We are reaching a point where we are having to invest more greenfield because there's no space in those facilities. But to Dan's point, we are designing those greenfields so they're much more modularized and we can scale them at a rate much faster going forward. But I think our existing historical footprint is, at the end of the day, largely filled out from a bricks -- within the bricks-and-mortar that exists.
Operator: And our next question -- and I do apologize in advance if I mispronounce the last name, Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.
Gabrial Hajde: Thanks for squeezing me here at the end, guys appreciate it. Dan and John, you guys have mentioned still water a couple of times. So I'm going to focus on that a little bit. Can you share with us some of the conversations that you're having from customers? And are they starting from a point of differentiation and premiumization? Or is it starting from an ESG angle? And I'm sort of thinking about the comments that Mark made about what we're seeing in terms of other organizations supporting recycling technology and infrastructure to continue to have a multi-format approach or go-to-market strategy. So just trying to understand that.
Dan Fisher: So I would say, start with the retailer and back into the customer, and that will dictate whether it's a premium discussion or it's an ESG type of discussion. So -- and we're involved in those conversations at present. For us, the easiest transition is into the premium side of the water. I mean, it opens up the doors to innovation. There's a higher profit pool there, and that's where the customers are starting, now what they're getting pushed by, green pieces and target these days and there's an awful lot of focus by the two big retailers, at least in North America and even in Europe on how quickly they can address some of the plastic that's in their aisles. But what -- the conversations we're having right now, we're starting with premium. And if it transitions into other, you're going to have to address supply chain cost and filling and all of that in a big way. And I think the pressure will come from the retailers on to our customers, and we're certainly in a position where we can help them with those.
John Hayes: Yes. And the only thing I'd add is that from a customer perspective, what we're seeing is a wide variety of new start-ups that are taking advantage of the gap that exists right now. So they're starting in water and they're going only can so...
Gabrial Hajde: That's helpful. And then, I don't know, John or Scott, can you put into context for us the comment about getting back to 10% to 15% earnings growth over a long-term basis? Is that something that can be -- is in your sights for 2020, specifically? Or is that more -- should we think about it over the next couple of years?
John Hayes: Well, I won't say getting back to because we never had to get back to. We've always been -- in fact, we were 15% last year. What we're saying is, historically, we've had two measurable focuses that much of our incentive compensation is tied to. The first is EVA dollar growth, and you can look at our long-term incentive plans and see that the target is 4%, the upside is 8%. We try and drive to that. The second that we have long term, as long as I've been at Ball Corporation, we have talked about our growth goals of at least 10% to 15% per year. And we think if we execute in 2020, we could be at the high end or beyond of that range, but it's time to execute right now. Mladin, we'll take one more question and then wrap it up.
Operator: We do have a follow-up from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc, please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: It thanks so much for taking my follow up system. Just Dan, forgive me if I missed this, when you talked about Europe being up low double digits percentage-wise before the inclusion of the plants that you're moving, can you just repeat what you said about what that you expect the total impact to be growth-wise?
Dan Fisher: Are you -- the double digit, I don't know, think came from Scott on the earnings.
Adam Josephson: Oh, I'm sorry, just about moving the Egypt and Turkey plants into Europe from...
Scott Morrison: So I said Europe would be up low teens on a percentage basis, and then you'd have to add in the profitability from Turkey and Egypt, which was largely what showed up in EMEA before into those numbers.
Adam Josephson: Okay. I'll go look and just remind myself what that was. And then South America, Scott, you commented would be up as well. Forgive me if I missed this, did you quantify that as you did the other segments?
Scott Morrison: No. South America will be up kind of mid to upper single digits percentage-wise on an operating earnings basis. No. South America will be up kind of mid to upper single digits percentage-wise on an operating earnings basis.
Operator: And those are all the questions we have. I'll turn the call back over to you, sir.
John Hayes: Okay. Thank you very much, Mladin. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to starting the year strong in 2020. Everyone, have a good one.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today, we thank you for your participation, everyone have a great rest of your day, you may disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is recorded, Thursday, October 31, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Great, thank you Malika and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings, and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage businesses. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then we'll finish up with some comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses, as well as our outlook for the company. Growth in our businesses continue to exceed our expectations and our demand outlook heading into 2020 and beyond remains quite strong. During the quarter, overall global beverage volumes were up 4%. Our aerospace revenues were up more than 30%. We successfully launched our lightweight aluminum cups business. We completed the sale of two underperforming businesses and we consistently executed share buybacks, including dividends, and as of today, we have returned an excess of $900 million to shareholders. During the quarter and year-to-date, our volume growth in our beverage can businesses actually been hampered by tight inventory levels, tight capacity conditions and some manufacturing inefficiencies. Across the globe, we are actively investing in new aluminum packaging production to serve increasing demand for aluminum cans, bottles and now cups. In our earnings press release, we announced additional beverage can expansion plans that Dan will get into shortly. New product introductions and sustainability are the key drivers for us, as customers seek out aluminum packaging solutions. In an environment of strong demand, particularly in our portfolio of specialty can sizes as well as tight inventories, we continue to experience short-term cost to serve this growth, particularly in our North and Central American packaging business. And we are focused on building our capacity to catch up with this growth. Our customers plans to convert more packaging to aluminum and consumers environmental consciousness are supporting our decision to deploy high returning capital at a responsible pace. Scott and Dan will discuss these opportunities across our various geographies and businesses. In aerospace the team continues to deliver on its growth ambitions. Hiring is up, backlog is up and additional capital investments are ongoing in this business to keep up with the strong growth. From an earnings perspective, our comparable results were up 25% despite tough year-over-year comps given FX headwinds, the July 2018 steel food can business sale and wind down of the end sales agreement in South America. Our North and Central American segment continued to feel the impact of previously discussed U.S. aluminum scrap headwinds and product, project start-up costs. All other segments were at or above our expectations. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in each of our main geographies going forward. Now key highlights for the quarter include, as mentioned previously, overall global beverage can growth of approximately 4% was driven by 10% specialty can growth. Today specialty cans represent over 42% of our mix on a global basis. The growth was prevalent in our largest markets with North and Central America up approximately 3% year-over-year, South America up 5% and Europe up 4%, while EMEA returned to grow. We completed the sale of our China beverage can business and we expect to receive the cash proceeds in the fourth quarter. We announced the sale of our Argentine steel aerosol business and subsequently closed on the sale in late October. Our aerospace revenues, as I mentioned, were up over 30% and operating earnings were up 35%, while we don't expect this level of growth to continue in the fourth quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comp, we do expect our aerospace revenues and earnings to grow over the next several years at strong double-digit rates. And aluminum aerosol was up low single-digits with investment for new product innovation we're continuing. Our focus areas continue to be maximizing the value and performance of the investments we've made to-date, in order to capture as much growth as we can manage. Continuing to proactively invest in our beverage can business to service the growing needs of our customers. Hiring, training and mentoring the most talented people to capture this growth in all of our business. And lastly, raising awareness and educating consumers, governments and other stakeholders on the facts of sustainability, including but not limited to the infinitely recyclable nature of aluminum products as well as carbon footprint benefits that recycled aluminum has over all other substrates. So in summary, we continue to see strong growth in, at the company, and while we continue to have some previously articulated short-term cost challenges to serve this growth, we believe these headwinds will moderate over time as additional new assets ramp-up going into 2020 and beyond. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of deploying capital against growth opportunities, increasing EVA dollars and earnings over time through higher revenues above our cost growth, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, growing new innovative packaging products like the cup and expanding aerospace, all with the return of value to our shareholders mindset. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel Fisher : Thanks, John. As John alluded to, new product launches and substrate conversions to aluminum packaging in the beverage industry are still in the early stages. In addition to multiple customers announcing trials of still water in cans and or publicizing an increase of aluminum packaging in their overall beverage portfolio mix, we successfully launched our new infinitely recyclable brandable aluminum cups. With an addressable market of 93 billion units globally, a third of which are in the U.S., we are incredibly excited about this new product in our recently announced multi-year investment plans to construct a dedicated aluminum cup manufacturing plant in Rome, Georgia, with the first commercial cups expected off the line within 12 to 15 months. Across our global operations, our team continues to manage tremendous growth complexity and incredibly tight supply demand conditions. As we prepare for an acceleration of products converting from PET to cans, while supporting to the best of our ability, new categories leveraging aluminum packaging, we are providing additional resources to our plant operations in the areas of talent, training and mentoring. As John said, until we have more assets up and running, cost to serve the surging growth may linger over the next quarter or two in North America's performance, given the U.S. aluminum scrap situation and leveraging the fourth quarter to rebuild inventory levels heading into 2020. Further investments will be required to overcome the greater than anticipated specialty growth of approximately 10% plus over the past 18 months. Our operations need a bit of breathing room to return to historical operational leverage on incremental sales. We believe the expansion announcements in our Q2 release along with today's announcements will get us there over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. Turning to growth. Our third quarter global beverage can shipments were up 4% and comparable operating earnings increased only slightly year-over-year, given the U.S. aluminum scrap, continuous U.S. line of inefficiencies, final wind down of the South America ends manufacturing agreement as well as euro FX earnings translation headwinds in Argentine Peso volatility. All-in, these issues impact the comparable global beverage earnings $40 million to $45 million in the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the unfavorable impact of U.S. aluminum scrap, logistics and customer order and complexities, have largely been addressed and contracts renewing in 2020. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North American segment volumes were up 3% in the quarter. Sold out customer conditions in spiked seltzers, double-digit growth in wine, craft beer, new water brands, energy drinks, spirits and premix cocktails in cans led to 4% year-over-year growth in specialty despite tight conditions for cans. We are thankful we made the investments we did in 2018 and year-to-date 2019. We just wish we would have done more. Inventory levels continue to be low in every plants in our network is running at maximum utilization. Conversions, line speed ups and additions at existing facilities in Georgia and Texas are largely on track. As John noted in our press release, we are excited to announce the construction of a new facility, excuse me, a new specialty beverage can manufacturing facility in Glendale, Arizona to support the new can filling facility for a major customer as well as other third parties. Initially a high speed, two line facility, we expect this plant to come online in early 2021 and will have the capability to be further scaled as demand dictates. We are finalizing plans for new capacity in the Northeast and actively exploring further capacity expansion across the region, as our customers continue to invest in their can filling businesses. We look forward to the multi-year opportunity of offering new products and more specialty aluminum can, bottle and cups capability to support our customers growth. Following these investments, our plant and sales teams will gain some headroom across the system, allowing us to get cost in line, better serve our existing and new customers, and with previously negotiated contracts favorably resetting at the beginning of 2020, I fully expect strong earnings momentum across North America as we close out 2019 and accelerate profitability in 2020 and beyond. Turning to our South American segment. Our volumes were up 5% in the third quarter. Year-over-year quarterly earnings were impacted by the final wind down of the ends agreement, FX headwinds related to the Argentine peso, start-up costs related to our new plant in Paraguay as well as incremental warehousing and logistics costs related to customer mix and preparedness in advance of the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Operating earnings are expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our new plants in Paraguay started up on schedule in late October. Chile is performing in line with expectations and despite economic volatility in Argentina, can demand is holding up well in the region. And similar to North America, overall South America industry trends remained strong with cans, new product and brand launches for beer, wine, energy and still water in cans, as well as multiple brewery expansions will support additional investment across the industry. European beverage earnings were up 7% in the third quarter due to volume growth and improved year-over-year operational performance. Despite a $4 million unfavorable operating earnings translation impact in the quarter, on a constant currency basis, comparable operating earnings were up more than 12%. Volumes increased 4% in the third quarter, despite mixed weather during the quarter. Our customers operations continue to add new can filling lines which will benefit industry growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking ahead, we will leverage our existing Continental Europe network with near term line speed ups and we are in the process of finalizing a near and long-term capacity expansion strategy in Russia, in other areas of Europe to support customers growth. Turning to EMEA. The demand environment net expectations in the quarter, operationally, the plants continue to focus on their cost and post the sale of China. We will continue to assess opportunities to prudently invest if the economics justify. With all the growth across our largest regions, we will be laser focused on prioritizing capital for the best long-term economic outcome and on improving execution. In summary, global beverage can demand momentum has continued in our three largest regions of North and Central America, South America and Europe. Supply demand globally for cans is tight. Our sustainability, commercial, engineering and talent management teams have a full court press on supporting our plant teams. Aligning with the right customers, leveraging our innovation in product portfolio, EVA returns improvement, managing a proper pace of spend relative to customers' long-term needs and building out a complete cups business make for interesting and exciting work. Thank you again to all our teams around the globe. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison : Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share were $0.70 versus $0.56 in the third quarter of 2018. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage can shipments, very solid aerospace performance, a lower effective tax rate and lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. steel food and aerosol business, euro earnings translation headwinds and lower year-over-year and sales performance in South America and U.S. cost that Dan just outlined. In addition, global beverage revenues reflect a 6% unfavorable impact from the pass-through of lower cost aluminum. Net debt ended the quarter at $6.5 billion and reflects our typical seasonal working capital build and ongoing share buyback. We continue to anticipate year end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as we buy back stock, invest in our businesses and pay dividends. Close to 90% of Ball's balance sheet debt is at fixed rates and we've reached our target leverage levels. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and provides ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs. As we close out 2019 and prepare for 2020, our comparable EBITDA we'll exit this year in essentially a $2 billion run rate. In the quarter, we made an incremental $75 million contribution to our pension plans that along with higher than initially anticipated CapEx spend to support our growth, we see, that we see 2019 free cash flow is now being in the range of $900 million. Full year interest expense will be a little more than $310 million and the full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 18% to 19%, and corporate undistributed will likely run just under $60 million representing benefits from strong overall cost management, some favorable FX impacts and true ups for various benefit and compensation plans in the quarter. Through today, we have executed nearly $800 million of net share repurchases and paid out approximately $130 million of dividends. We will continue to flow meaningful amounts of free cash flow, we have great opportunities to invest in cans, cups and aerospace, which will require more capital than we thought a year ago. Like always, we will invest capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively and consistently repurchasing stock and paying dividends for the benefit of our long-term shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business, global volumes grew nearly 4% in the quarter. We continue to see opportunities to broaden our product and customer portfolio and global footprint through either bolt-on, M&A or Greenfield investment. We look forward to being able to discuss additional innovation and sustainability initiatives as we move forward. As mentioned, our aerospace business reported 30% revenue growth and 35% operating earnings growth on solid contract performance, partially offset by incremental labor costs. Year-to-date through nine months, we've welcome 840 new aerospace employees and we anticipate by year-end total aerospace headcount will increase by 1,000 employees. On boarding new employees, providing mentors, further expanding of our Colorado facilities, whether it'd be offices, manufacturing, test and clean room space and executing on our strong backlog continue to be the main focus. Looking forward, the program as recently won are vital to the intelligence for connascence and surveillance as well as the climate change and weather prediction needs of our country. These projects provide valuable challenging work for our incredibly talented employee base over the next few years, where we should be able to grow profitability in excess of 15% per year during that time. In addition, there are either, even greater future program opportunities that we are pursuing that would position us even more nicely, if we are able to secure them. Our long-term prospects have never been brighter. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace, while delivering significant value to our shareholders. We look forward to driving our business to meet or exceed our long-term diluted earnings per share and EVA dollar growth goals. Have you've heard, as you've heard me say before, our ability to succeed is because of our people, our culture, our EVA mindset, a healthy balance sheet and exceptional product and technologies. We will continue to responsibly invest do what is best for Ball and our shareholders' long-term success. And with that Malika, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. 
George Staphos: I just want to get to the growth that you're seeing and the line speed of activity that you're seeing relative to what you were talking about last quarter. And this is before the new plant in Glendale and the potential plant in the Northeast. I think you said last quarter that you were looking at an additional 4 billion to 5 billion cans by mid '21.  And if I read or heard correctly it's now in excess of 5 billion in 12 to 18 months, which would suggest that you're ahead of schedule in numbers and also in terms of timing. Is that correct or am I missing something there and where are you finding that incremental capacity relatedly, the new plant in Glendale, the one you're looking at, perhaps in the Northeast. Can you comment to the extent possible, how much of that volume might be committed to already or it would be presumably committed to with an existing customer or to contracted such it's not spot capacity in the market, and how you're using that leverage in commercial opportunities? And I had a couple of follow ons. Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Sure. George, I guess relative to the Northeast, we're in the final legs of contract negotiations. We don't regularly talk about customer negotiations but safe to say we wouldn't be contemplating a Greenfield facility if we didn't have line of sight into a large portion of that volume, and that would also, we're also contemplating a scalable facility as well there, much like what we've indicated in the comments here relative to Glendale. And your 5 billion, 5 billion plus excess comment I'd say yes, I think we see line of sight into growth rates and capacity expansion that would get in excess of 5 billion and a lot of it just simply has to do with the growth rates that continue to kind of outpace candidly our expectation, specifically on the specialty can growth side.
George Staphos: But Dan is it sort of necessity is the mother, invention so as the demands come in you have found ways to tweak the lines even I guess more quickly and to create a little bit more incremental capacity and you thought you'd have otherwise, or you just want to get a little bit at where that delta has come from?
John Hayes: Yes, I think more of its just relative to the investments that we're contemplating and suggesting. I think, this is, we can do some things, certainly in a lot of our facilities to increase efficiencies, but to get in the neighborhood of 5 billion additional cans, is going to come from new capital overwhelmingly.
Daniel Fisher: And George I'd just add on to that, there is a lot of speed ups that we do in our existing facilities. So we don't regularly talk about, that's also included as well and so we're debottlenecking every conceivable line in our system.
George Staphos: Okay. My two last follow-ons. I'll ask them in sequence and turn it over. I know you have a lot of other questions. Can you comment at all in terms of what market data, what consumer reaction, what your customers are saying about the aluminum cup? And what's seemingly viable enough, sufficiently viable for you to build a new plant in Rome and Georgia. How does consumer see it? And then there was a fairly big swing in working capital quarter-on-quarter, on a year-on-year basis. I'm assuming some of that's the pension funding, but if you could provide a bit more detail there Scott, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
Daniel Fisher: Yes, on the cup side, George, I would say there is definitely line of sight into kind of on-premise large venues, concerts, the cups already, as you probably are well aware in NHL, NBA, NFL, the news concert venues on college campuses, so that customer base is a handful of really large customers that manage tens of thousands of venues, and we're having very productive conversations there for this product, and I think John as probably alluded to this at times. For this to be a much bigger business then you're going down the retail avenue and we're starting conversations there. Those are early innings there but we feel really good about the amount of capital we put in place in Rome and the customer activity in the fact that we're going to have a pretty full line and pretty short order.
Scott Morrison: And on the working capital front, George the pension is part of it, but the biggest part year-over-year was the impact of the sale of the tinplate business last year, where we essentially collected all of that working capital when that business was sold. So that's the biggest difference.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Maguire: You obviously played out a little bit differently then you thought and you did provide some 2019 guidance many years ago, that you're close to hitting but falling a little bit shot. I, just wonder if you could provide a little bit of an, update us now on kind of where we sit at some of the issues that you've had in 2019 that are non-repeats, and really just trying to set us up for kind of what we should be expecting in 2020. Obviously, you have the pricing kicking in the volumes, a lot of these one-time cost will be gone. Just trying to kind of set some of the noise and get a better sense of kind of how you're thinking about 2020 shaping up at this point?
Scott Morrison: Sure. Well, I think its probably helpful when we put those numbers out there 2016, the world has changed a lot. It's actually going to be exiting this year, about a $2 billion run rate, if you look at what will generate go back half of the year. But you look since 2016 we had the sale of the tinplate food business and now China, we have the class of the Egyptian economy, a few years ago. Global FX volatility, so we're pretty happy where we're at. We've had scrap issues this year and more start-up costs. I think we've talked about the scrap issues getting fixed in new contracts. as we enter 2020 and new volume. And so I see nice growth ahead. I think we're at a point here where some of the headwinds that we've had are going to get behind us and as our plan start to run better we start to sell more put more of this capacity in. We are going to like the results of that. So I see a nice improvement next year from earnings and cash flow standpoint, earnings standpoint.
Brian Maguire: Okay, great. Last question from me just, I know the two big still water brands have been trialing cans moving from PET to cans. I'm sure there's been, other customers looking at that also. I'm just wondering if you have any early feedback on, not those customers in particular, but just generally what the feedback has been on still water in cans and then related to that, are you seeing any other beverages that are traditionally been in PET start to pursue some trials in cans, whether it's juices or sports drinks or things like that?
Daniel Fisher: I'd say, on the trials and cans and I think we've commented on this a couple of times, probably over the last three or four quarters. The one metric that really lends itself to more products and more categories moving into cans is new product introductions and the new product introduction number in North America from a substrate composition, was cans historically new products would come out about 35% to 40% of the time in cans and in the last quarter were north of 70%. We are having conversations with more brand teams and more marketing teams, about moving more product in a bigger way in the cans. Now, they're not 100% in plastic or 100% in a substrate, but we're seeing more and more appetite to move product into cans with some of the larger CPG customers. On the still water front, we're seeing a lot of aggressive product launches by a number of emerging brands, in the still water space. And I would say that will be the catalyst for more of the larger folks to move, they will force the move of the larger CPG companies. We're having some intensified conversations in Europe, probably even more so now than North America but continued to see an awful lot of still water brands, emerging brands coming out and they are coming out in all different shapes of cans and bottles because it's such a disruptive space right now. But a lot of momentum there is still small volumes, but I would see that momentum continuing to build.
John Hayes: Yes, Brian, this is John just put a finer point on the first part of Dan's answer, I'm looking at some market data here in every category the can is up. CSD its up, big beer it's up, energy it's up, water it's up, craft it's up, wine it's up, FAB is up and so we're seeing a broad based across the board migration and that's why we're excited about where we are right now.
Brian Maguire: Okay. I mean, in the context of capacity constraints, that's all very impressive. Yes, thanks again for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. 
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess in your press release, in your comments you noted specific North America that you had very tight low inventory levels. I guess on that how are you adjusting production schedules as you think about 2020 to give you system or flexibility, and I guess on that, are you changing some of the contract terms for newer customers to bias toward take or papers requirements, in the past you've talked about customers changing ordering patterns last minute and I'm wondering how that's changed, if at all given the tight supply in the industry?
Daniel Fisher: We will, we are continuing to adjust contracts to try to buy a little bit more level load, little bit more disciplined from the customer in terms of last minute requirements, last minute orders. Requirement contracts are starting to become a thing of the past. We need all of those to kick-in and unfortunately, it will take us a handful of years to get all of that in sync. And yes, we are definitely having conversations more a kin to kind of take-or-pay with our customers, which is a massive step change from even two years ago. So all of that's in the fall, but the reality is, those are getting us incremental benefits and with growth especially on the specialty side of 10% plus, we just need to get some significant capacity put in place here over the next 12 to 24 months before we can really get kind of the breathing room we need to operate efficiently.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And I guess going back to John in your comments on category growth, just kind of stepping back, what do you think the regions are going to shake out from a growth standpoint. The major regions for 2019 from a volume standpoint. I mean it looks like Brazil exploded to the upside and so on. And how are you thinking about 2020 from an industry standpoint? And then how should we kind of overlay the capacity you have coming on over the next 12 to 18 months?
John Hayes: We, it's tense here that 2019 question first. As you know anything north of equator is a seasonally slow quarter. So we got to put that in context. And what we're doing is actually using this opportunity. Dan mentioned it in his prepared remarks, that because it is a seasonally slower we are using that trying to kind of rebuild our inventories. We knew going into the third quarter that we were already low on inventory. And so you, my point is, you can only sell what you actually have on the floor or can make. And so as we go into 2019, we don't see any appreciable differences in the fourth quarter in terms of the growth rates that we've been seeing. And as we go into 2019, I think growth is just a function of how many cans we're able to make. And as Dan had mentioned, we're trying to keep up as much as we can. But this kind of caught us off guard to the upside. And I think if there is any, if we're able to get our manufacturing efficiencies back to where we are, that's where a lot of focus is going on right now. I think the growth rates that you've seen in 2019 are going to be the same in 2020 with a bias to the upside if we have the cans to sell.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. 
Anthony Pettinari: In the last quarter's release, I think you'd cited mix as being a potential driver of earnings in North America in the second half. But I think today you referenced it is a headwind. And I'm just wondering is something sort of changed relative to expectations or if you could quantify the mix hit and if this negative kind of mix impact lingers in the 4Q?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I would say, I don't expect it to linger moving forward. The low inventory levels that we entered into Q3, were largely in and around the growth categories. The higher margin categories in the specialty cans, and we just didn't produce at the rates that we hope we were anticipating. Those inefficiencies, I think Scott's commented on and I've comment on John's comment that's the combination of the inefficiencies the facilities translate into adverse customer mix versus what we anticipated.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the aluminum cup. Are there any thoughts you can share on maybe expected returns or margins relative to a greenfield bev can lant and then the timeline of how long you would expect the ramp up in Rome to go for and maybe kind of start-up cost relative to a bev can plant, anything you can share there?
John Hayes: Yes, I think, first on the return side. This is, as you know, this is a proprietary technology, and we expect this to be among the higher return projects that we have on our plate right now. Obviously, it's as much about the ramp-up of that and given its a new product that we're trying to be as balanced and realistic as possible in terms of the learning curve and ramp up, and so that's why Dan had mentioned earlier that there's really two end markets, is going to be servicing number one on the food service side, which is the big venues on-premise, think of it that way. And then the second one is retail. I think it's probably premature to talk about what this specific learning curve will be. But I would not expect as we sit here right now it to be to appreciably different than say specialty can line but we'll update people more as we get into this because, we're making it as you know in our test lab right now and we have designed and we are starting to execute on the building of a full-scale facility.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton. Please go ahead. And you are with JP Morgan. 
Tyler Langton: I think Dan, just had a question on costs. I think you said aluminum scrap cost of sort of a high growth and FX is kind of $40 million to $45 million hit in the quarter. I mean, do you have a rough sense for, I guess just for the aluminum scrap in the cost side, what that was in the quarter and kind of a rough estimate of kind of what you expect for the year for those items?
Daniel Fisher: Sure. I think $11 million, $10 million to $11 million on the scrap in the quarter and that's level loaded throughout the balance of the year. So it will be in the area of $40 million when we exit 2019. Manufacturing inefficiencies in North America alone were probably in the neighborhood of $20 million. Then we talked about the South America ends that contract running out of approximately $5 million and then net, net, net $7 million from FX in the quarter.
Tyler Langton: Great. That's helpful. And then just Scott on free cash flow. I think you said, free cash for this year of around $900 million. Do you have sort of details on sort of working capital, CapEx sort of in that assumption?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think CapEx will be over $600 million, that's why, that's in part why the free cash flow numbers coming down. And then working capital will be a slight, it will be close to a push, but maybe a slight use of working capital, by the end of the year.
Tyler Langton: And then just the $75 million pension contributions this year. What's kind of, do you have sense for what the normal run rate going forward?
Scott Morrison: That was around year-to-year, but that was really just incremental to what our initial plans what had been laid out in January, but in total will fund like $150 million full year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Adam Josephson: Scott, I was just following up on one of the last questions about the one timer's for this year, excuse me, Dan. I think you said $40 million of scrap cost $20 million of manufacturing inefficiencies and then there were start-up costs this year, but it presumably will mostly go away next year. So it's $40 million, $20 million and then something else for the start-up?
Daniel Fisher: The scraps $40 million, I was, $40 million for the year, but the $20 million for North America inefficiencies was a quarter number. It's a bridge for the $40 million that we discussed, so the start-up costs with Paraguay and some other things related to Goodyear plus the inefficiencies, it's probably closer to the $40 million to $50 million number.
Adam Josephson: Okay, plus the scrap of $40 million. So you're talking one timer's of close to $100 million this year?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. I would also suggest that going forward, it's start-up costs will continue as we put new facilities in place. So I don't necessarily think those are one-time in the balance of year-on-year.
Adam Josephson: And then I guess similar on the inefficiencies, I think you said Dan they'll bleed into 1Q, there'll be in 4Q and bleed into 1Q, but presumably thereafter they will lessen in magnitude, is that right?
Scott Morrison: Yes, this is Scott. I would just look at it, it's a different bucket. So we have some in efficiency, but there's also some start-up cost. Start-up costs are necessarily going to go away because we are going to start some new plants next year too. So that's around. The inefficiencies in the system out of pattern freight, those kinds of things, not having the right inventory in the right places, those kind of things we think we can get ahead of as we get into next year. But the start-up costs we'll continue to highlight start-up costs as we go forward, because I think it will become, it will have it as we build these new plants.
Adam Josephson: Right. Yes. Dan, I think you talked about some of your contracts favorably resetting next year. I know you talked at the Analyst Day about a year ago about capitalizing on commercial opportunities with 15% to 20% of your contract volumes to be renegotiated by the end of this year. Can you go into any more detail about that Dan, in terms of the impact on next year?
Daniel Fisher: No, I think it's still consistent with what we've said over the last couple of earnings calls. It's still in the neighborhood of 20% year-on-year.
Adam Josephson: Okay, just one on the foodservice expansion. So that's typically a low margin or a lower margin business for packaging companies. Plastic cup margins for example are quite low and there are hardly any public packaging companies that are in that business. So what kind of margin business do you expect this to be for you, just given that it seems to be a fairly low margin business for the packaging industry as a whole?
John Hayes: No, it will maybe, but not in this case. Number one, this is priced at the economics of a compostable cup, number one. Number two, it has built more so they, our customers, meaning the venues can sell sponsorship on that. So it's a net revenue generated for them in all of our experience to date where it has been in market. They have been extremely happy with that. The demand for spend is extremely strong, and I stand by my words I said earlier, from a return project perspective for Ball Corporation that will be among the better return projects that we have on our plate right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. 
Chip Dillon: We, first question I had is, if you could just verify I think it was mentioned that the volume growth in Europe was up 4% and then I think I heard 7% was that the specialty component?
John Hayes: Europe was up for the quarter up 4%. No, I think in terms of your, I'm not sure where the 7% came from.
Chip Dillon: Okay. I must have just misheard that. And then I know in the second quarter call, you said the backlog in aerospace was up a little over $2 billion, now it's up to $2.2 billion that's contracted. Back then you said the non, I guess the one but not contracted was $4.8 billion. And I guess two questions. Where would that number stand now? And secondly, I just want be clear that's in addition to what is contracted. So for example, in the second quarter, you actually had visibility of close to $7 billion if all the one but not contracted turns into actual business?
Daniel Fisher: That is correct. It's, we break it out in two. The contracted backlog is money good as I like to describe it, because it's contracted. And then the won not book is we have won programs, but they have, we haven't signed the contract yet. In total, you're absolutely right, it's about $7 billion. That number quarter-over-quarter really hasn't changed all of that much in total. The difference is the funded backlog. The money good is actually up a little bit and the one not booked is down just a little bit only because we didn't, there weren't any big contracts that we were awarded in the third quarter, but yet some of the ones that we were awarded previously we have now signed the contracts.
Chip Dillon: Okay. And then last one, and good morning, Dan. I think Dan you mentioned that the market for I guess cups, I think you mentioned a 90 billion unit number. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right and what you were referring to. I think when you were in your prepared comments about the new Rome plant. And by the way do you have a capacity figure for that plant that you can share with us?
Daniel Fisher: Not right now. We're still transitioning from pilot to a fully engineered plant, but you could say it's probably close to a standard, output for a standard line. Maybe a little less. The 93 billion units is the total global. Non-reusable cup volume and a third of that is in the domestic U.S. and that's primarily our focus right now. Then one clarifying comment is on specialty growth in Europe, it was 15% plus in the quarter.
Chip Dillon: I got you. And again for the company overall, it was 10%...
Daniel Fisher: That's correct.
Chip Dillon: Everywhere. Okay, got you. Very helpful, thank you.
Daniel Fisher: You bet.
Scott Morrison: This is Scott. Just to clarify Adam's question before on the start-up cost and inefficiencies if you think about it, we've got like $50 million this year in North America on the scrap. $40 million to $50 million in scrap and another $40 million in manufacturing efficiencies. A good chunk of the scrap will go, most of that scrap will go away. And then, a good chunk of those manufacturing inefficiencies should reduce next year. Just to clarify.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. 
Arun Viswanathan: I just wanted to follow-up on that last point with, let's say, you get a good portion of the scrap back, and how is the mechanism that coming back is that is still your contracts if you alluded to earlier. And then, let's say, you do get a good portion of that back, you still have it coming on your start-up costs, will the volume kind of cover the rest of the shortfall. So you're essentially made whole or how should we think about that? Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: So on the scrap it is yes. Overwhelmingly, it'll be contractually fixed starting in 2020 and then moving forward. And then the inefficiencies are simply I think as we've indicated previously Goodyear is probably about six months behind where we thought in terms of the ramp-up curve, that coupled with kind of unplanned double-digit growth on specialty, can we lost basically five to six month of peak season, created more turnover, more label changes, inventory in the wrong spots and we think that where we're running right now in Goodyear and the investments, we're putting in place we will be able to better manage our portfolio in our network going into next year. So, those inefficiencies will subside.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess the volume growth, would that essentially cover the rest of that $100 million or so that you saw this year?
John Hayes: Not sure we understand the question.
Arun Viswanathan: Well, it just that you mentioned about $100 million headwind from these items as far as scrap and efficiencies and start-up costs. The volume growth that you're seeing next year, if you see some $70 million or $80 million offset of that $100 million, does the volume growth cover the other $20 million or $30 million shortfall things this year?
John Hayes: Well, here is another way we look at it.
Arun Viswanathan: The volume growth that you expect next year, yes.
John Hayes: Yes. In the volume growth, we're spending this capital to actually get out ahead because we don't have, we don't, the inefficiencies are created by this volume growth. So it's, in some ways it's embedded. It's actually servicing this volume growth at a much more efficient way. I think that's what Dan was saying a minute ago.
Daniel Fisher: And there are real, in Scott comment on this and I attempted to cover, there are real start-up costs associated with building new facilities, hiring people in advance of actually putting a bit of work on commercialized products. Those costs as we lay and more new lines and we build Greenfield facilities, I'm not sure the growth will offset all of those start-up costs we're going through our strategic planning period right now, we will know more over the next 90 days. But given the size and scale of the investments we're making, those start-up cost could very well be bigger going forward in the next couple of years at least. And I think that's what Scott was alluding to, that what we experienced this year, just with the magnitude of the capital investment.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, that's helpful. I mean, lastly, just on the cash side, maybe you can just discuss how your cash flow expectations are changed given these growth opportunities especially for 2020? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: So our tax rate, I mean I said for this year it should be between 18% and 19%. We don't see a meaningful difference as we start to look at next year.
Arun Viswanathan: I was actually asking about the cash flow. Sorry.
Scott Morrison: I mean we are not paying out any U.S. tax right now. And we see that...
Arun Viswanathan: No, no. I was actually asking the cash flow. How the cash flow outlook has changed given these greater investments?
Scott Morrison: Going forward.
Arun Viswanathan: Yes.
Scott Morrison: I mean, I think we'll have, we'll continue to have capital spend in excess of $600 million for the next couple of years. So I think we're going to have elevated capital. We've gotten a lot of benefits out of working capital in the last couple of years, that's kind of run its course. I don't see that continuing. So I think there'll be a little bit more pressure. But I think also the earnings are going to tick up nicely. So it's a little too early to give you specifics, but I think big picture that's the direction.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. 
Neel Kumar: Given that you have several different opinion uses for capital including cans, cups and aerospace, do you see a sense of how you're choosing the prioritize your capital. And do you think you'll still be able to reach a target of $1 billion in buybacks, with the higher CapEx?
John Hayes: This is John. Let me take it. We think about this in the long-term, and our job is pretty straightforward, it's to generate as much operating cash flow as possible, and then invest it where we think the greatest returns are that could be in CapEx, in any one of our businesses or and/or it also can be giving it back to our shareholders. And there's always a balance between all those various things, because you want to make sure that you're investing for growth, while at the same time you're giving back to your shareholders and we tend to do both of that. So we're talking on the margin here. I think in terms of our CapEx, we see in all of our businesses on the aluminum side as well as aerospace side, we see great growth opportunities and we've mentioned many of those things already, whether it's the Glendale facility, whether it's continue speed ups, Dan had mentioned in his prepared remarks in Russia that we're looking to make investments. Whether it's on the cup side and building the new Rome facilities as well as spending $100 million or so on the Colorado campus for the aerospace. So once after all that, then we take the free cash flow there and give it back to our shareholders in terms of dividends and share repurchases. And so it's of right now as we sit here today, I think we have a little bit more as Scott said, elevated CapEx because of all these growth opportunities, but rest assured, that we're going to be giving back all the capital after these CapEx projects back to our shareholders.
Neel Kumar: And then just had a Goodyear. Can you just talk about whether you've seen any progress with the two final lines ramping up there? Is it currently operating levels that you want?
Daniel Fisher: In the last nine weeks, we've seen, it return to our expected or planned efficiency levels. So I think heading into the fourth quarter of 2020 we're in a good spot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. 
Mark Wilde: Dan, I wondered if you can just help us with this sort of $5 billion of additional capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. I just want to understand kind of what the big buckets are there? I assume that things like this plant in the Northeast are not included in that?
Daniel Fisher: Correct. So I would say the announcements we made in the previous earnings call in, so you're seeing great growth in Brazil, continued substrate penetration there. There is probably in the neighborhood of 20% of that number would be coming from there. 60% of it will be coming from North America and the other 30% is going to come from Europe.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then I wondered, Dan, we had an announcement a couple of months ago from a customer that's going to do some self manufacturing in Brazil. And I just wondered what you make about how we should read that?
Daniel Fisher: Yes. It's a great question. I think they have threatened that, a myriad of times and they've even had press releases over the last four, three to four years, saying they were going to do that. Early stages, I don't think it's going to be a large-scale facility, based on what we know. But the biggest issue for that particular customer is they have a dominant returnable glass position in that country, and they are moving appreciably toward cans. And I think it's in a surety of supply play more than anything, just making sure that they can continue to move at the pace they need to in cans, and so I think it's early innings here and we'll see how it plays out with that particular customer in the marketplace.
Mark Wilde: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Last one I had. John, on the aluminum cup expansion. I assume that because you're dealing with some big on-premise providers that you can make recycling of those aluminum cups pretty efficient. Can you talk about any particular moves you're making to make sure that these cups are not just recyclable but actually are recycled?
John Hayes: Well, as you know aluminum has scrap value. So by definition, they are going to be recycled. But one of the beauties of out of the on-premise experiences, there are receptacles right there. So your point that they actually control. So it's not like going to a gas station buying a container and then you don't know where it goes. It is very contained. And so, as part of the rollout, whether it's at the College, Universities we've done so far, or the NBA, the NHL that we've done so far, they have very, its part of the whole rollout, they have worked with their waste management companies to make sure that they're capturing the value of the aluminum that is being recycled, because effectively unless people are taking those cups home, they are going to be recycled on, they are going to be collected on-premise there and so they can capture it in a much more efficient way.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Gabe Hajde: I was looking at Latin America, and I appreciate you guys don't necessarily look at it this way. But if I compare TTM earnings versus the same period of the prior TTM, it's down to the tune of around $90 million and I know this ends contract had come to close. But I was curious if you could address if there is any other structural issues within, I guess the geography and then from a margin perspective, again, I know you guys don't necessarily think about it directly by margin because of the impact from aluminum on revenue, but is there opportunity for that to improve going forward?
John Hayes: Yes, this is John. I'll take that. I think the vast majority of that was related to the end sales. Remember, it wasn't only just end sales in the economics around that there were some also some accounting adjustments related to the amortization of those end sales. So I think between the two, I don't have the number of top of my head, but it was a far and with the vast majority of it. I think as we go forward, now that it's more at a steady state baseline particularly going into the fourth quarter, you're going to see it's going to be a function of the volume growth and the regional volume growth, whether it's in Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina and the pricing and mix thereof.
Gabe Hajde: Okay. Thank you. And Scott, two part question on taxes. I know it's a fluid subject. But can you talk at all about the potential impact to your global tax strategy in a Brexit scenario, what that might look like? And then working capital, you had mentioned that there could be some pressure there. I'm assuming, given the growth that you are experiencing that can in fact be a use of cash or do you think you can hold the line there and keep it flat?
Scott Morrison: On the second part of that question. You mean as it relates to tax or other things?
Gabe Hajde: Two mutually exclusive questions. One is working capital given the growth that you're seeing, will we reasonably expect that to be a use of cash. And then separately, given Brexit and I think your overall global tax strategy could that change?
Scott Morrison: No, the Brexit we don't really think as much of an impact unless they completely changed rates later on, but we're not expecting Brexit to have any particular impact from a tax perspective. On the working capital front, we've been really good at getting a lot of money out of the working capital last several of years and I mentioned I think we've kind of done with that. But as the supply chain gets more complicated in terms of the number of other programs that we have around the world as the business grows, I could see some growth in working capital, but not appreciably at this point.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. 
George Staphos: Hi, everyone. Two quick questions from me. The first one, I just, I missed the point you're making about rebuilding inventories when you're going to, given the opportunities from a seasonal standpoint. You were commenting about South America, who are obviously going into a busier period now, and I just wasn't clear where that was going. And then I had a follow-on. If you could provide a bit more detail on that, I'd appreciate it.
John Hayes: Yeah, George. This, this is John. And I'm going to separate it in the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere, because as you point out, they are different seasonalities. But in the Northern Hemisphere, as we went, we take a step back and go back nine months. We started late 2018 and going into 2019 was stronger than expected volume growth, and then as we went in the second quarter, it was even stronger. And as a result, our inventories were depleted as we are going in the very busy summer selling season. And so, literally the inventories were extremely low and we were making literally shipping what we are making at that time. That's why we knew as we looked into the third and fourth quarter we didn't have any inventory to sell, and we're making what we were selling. And so the inventories were quite low. As we go into the fourth quarter. Now we have a little bit more breathing room. We have some of these new lines in the speed ups coming along, as well as a seasonally slow, so we're able to rebuild working with our customers on specific labels. We're able to rebuild, begin to rebuild the depleted inventories in Northern Hemisphere. And I really mean Europe and North America, there. The opposite is the true in South America, over the last six months or so, it's been more of the winter. The volume has been quite strong. So inventories in a perfect world are not as high as we would like them, but we used the summer to kind of rebuild as best we can in South America. The start of Paraguay plays a part of that and that's important. So as we go into the fourth quarter and the first quarter, which they're busy summer selling seasons. It's really a function of how fast the markets are going to be growing and relative to where we are in inventory. Is that helpful?
George Staphos: It was. Thank you. I appreciate that. If you run as you would like and I know that's a broad sort of term or phrase there because who's to say. Nonetheless, what kind of volume growth should we see globally in beverage cans for Ball Corp in 2020?
John Hayes: Good question and I would say probably in the 4% to 5% to 6% range that we're seeing, and it really depends so much upon mix George, because we also specialty is just a different, there's 30 plus different sizes in specialty. So 12 sleek, 16 ounce, 24 ounce for a very strong this year, we expect them to be next year, but with the new emerging categories about water and other things it very normally be a different type also. So it is a function of mix. Whether we are at the upper end or the lower end.
George Staphos: My last quick one. I'll turn it over. I recall from last quarter's call, the 4.5 billion to 5 billion, 5 billion plus did not include anything appreciable for water, still water conversion. Is that a correct recollection and given some of the projects that you've now announced today, do you expect that that will change and still water actually could be an appreciable amount of your new capacity and new volume going forward. Thank you and good luck in the quarter.
Daniel Fisher: Your recollection is correct, not a lot built in there, some, but not a lot. It's still over the next two to three years, it could be wrong, but it doesn't. We're not planning on an appreciable move in still water. We're definitely looking at a number of different customers and different can sizes but for it to be appreciable we will probably announce that along with a facility expansion.
John Hayes: I think we'll take one more question, we'll take one more question if there is.
Operator: Perfect. Our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. 
Debbie Jones: Just one question for you guys. The repeated theme here is the growth for you in the industry and I imagine one of the challenges, it's going to navigate through this and bring people into the company to start up these facilities and then retain them and this is a much bigger cash than maybe it has been in the past. And so I'm just wondering how you do that? Do you do things differently than you were doing before. And how do you kind of ensure that you to sound cliched and preserve the culture at all?
John Hayes: Yeah, it's a great question. Let me start by saying we're actually working more than we ever have across as one Ball. In the aerospace side, as you know, 50% of the people at Ball, in the aerospace business weren't here two years ago. And so we talked earlier in our prepared remarks, a lot about training and development but also about mentoring and instilling the Ball culture. We're taking that mindset that we've done over the last couple of years in aerospace and bringing into the beverage can side. So we are in a much more proactive way then, we have, bringing people on earlier. So one of the lessons learned in terms of Goodyear, for example, is it, we cannot think about bringing people on three, four months ahead of time and no, think that they're going to be able to manage as complexity. So we're looking at six, bringing them six to nine months in and using a plan concept from a mentoring perspective. And really using that as the opportunity to instill the values that we, values and skill sets that we think are critical to the future.
John Hayes: Okay. Malika. Well, thank you very much. We thank you all for your participation and we look forward to a very healthy fourth quarter and a good start to 2020. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the call. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is recorded today Thursday, August 1, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you, Lila, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's second quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the Company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I will provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for the Company. Growth in our businesses continued at or reason above our expectations. Overall, global beverage volumes were up approximately 5%, and our aerospace revenues were up more than 30%. Across the globe can demand continues to increase as sustainability progresses from a special interest initiative to a mainstream lifestyle, and innovation and execution drive more customers to seek out solutions in all of our divisions. To say this is an exciting time to be at our company and we said before may be an understatement. With this strong growth, we've experienced short-term costs to serve this growth particularly in our North and Central American and South America beverage can businesses. In fact, we probably less as pointed to a volume growth on the table as we're unable to deliver to and service to our customers at the level we typically expect ourselves. To stay on top of this growth and mitigate our line conversions, other pattern freight and others short-term headwinds, we plan to deploy additional capital to debottleneck existing lines and build new capacity in order to provide for even greater growth and flexibility to supply our customer's needs at the levels that they demand. Scott and Dan will discuss our investment opportunities to grow profitably across our various geographies and businesses. In aerospace, the team continues to deliver on its growth ambitions. Contract performance is strong, hiring is up and we expect to pursue further investments in this business to keep up with the strong growth that we continue to see. From an earnings perspective, our results were up despite tough year-over-year comps given the 2018 steel food and can business sale and conclusion at the end sale agreement in South America. As I mentioned, our North and Central America segment was challenged with previously discussed U.S. aluminum scrap headwinds and sequential project startup cost. All other segments were at or above our expectations. We expect these near-term costs headwinds to mitigate as we progress through the second half of the year and continue to expect year-over-year improvement in each of our main geographies. Now key highlights for the quarter include, as I mentioned previously, overall global beverage can growth of approximately 5% driven by 13% specialty can growth. In fact growth in our three key regions North and Central America, Europe and South America grew 6% when you exclude the declines we experienced in Asia. Dan will get into this later. Today specialty can represent over 42% of our mix on a global basis. The growth is prevalent our largest markets with North and Central America up approximately 4% year-over-year, South America up 12%, and Europe up 7%, while EMEA was down slightly due to continued difficult macroeconomic issues in this region. We received antitrust approval for the sale of our China beverage can business and we expect the transaction to close later in the third or fourth quarter depending on other governmental approvals around tax closeouts and foreign exchange flows. Our aerospace revenues were up over 30% and operating earnings were up 55%. While we don't expect this level of growth to continue, we do expect revenues to be up nearly 25% for the full year and operating earnings should continue to grow at revenue growth rates. Aluminum aerosol was up low single digits with new product innovation worth continuing. We continue to focus on raising awareness on sustainability, the benefits of aluminum packaging, and proactively investing in and offer aluminum packaging solutions to our customers. One interesting note regarding in a growth is that while many new products continue to move in the cans, our growth today has not been meaningfully impacted by any conversions of existing brands from plastic or other substrates to aluminum beverage cans, particularly the nonalcoholic categories including CSD and water. That said there have been several public announcements regarding such conversions that Dan will discuss and they will begin to hit the market later this year or early next year. In addition, this fall we will launch our new infinitely recyclable brandable aluminum cups that will make their commercials debuts in college and professional stadiums during the fall football season. With an addressable market of over 90 billion units globally, a third of which are in the U.S., we're incredibly excited about this new innovation product launch. Stay tuned for further media announcements. So in summary, we continue to see strong growth across our various businesses and while we've been challenged with short-term costs of service growth, we believe these headwinds will begin to moderate and dissipate as we move through the second half of the year. We have many exciting opportunities in front of us that set us up -- set our business up well going into 2020 and beyond. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of deploying capital and supportive growth opportunities, increasing EVA dollars in earning over time through higher revenues above cost growth, driving more mix shifts and especially containers, growing new innovative aluminum packaging products like the cup and expanding aerospace, all with return of value to our shareholders mindset. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks, John. Across our global operations, our team is navigating tremendous growth, complexity and incredibly tight supply demand conditions. Sustainability and new categories are fueling customer demand. And looking ahead, when existing products convert from single-serve PET to cans in 2020 and beyond given the recent announcements by two of the world's largest beverage brands, the growth for beverage cans will accelerate. In the near-term and until we have more assets up and running, costs to serve the surge in growth dampened in the North America's performance, given the U.S. aluminum scrap situation we called out last quarter, and pushing our existing plans and new lines to the maximum to keep customer in cans. Turning to growth. Our second quarter global beverage can shipments were up 5% and excluding declines in China and EMEA, global volumes were up 6%. However, comparable operating earnings were down slightly year-over-year due exclusively to the previously disclosed U.S. aluminum scrap issues and continued U.S. line inefficiencies. Completion of the South American [ENS] manufacturing agreement, macroeconomic issues in EMEA and some Euro FX earnings translation headwinds. All-in, these issues impact the comparable global beverage earnings 55 million in the quarter, with roughly 35 million in the North America business, 14 million in South America and 5 million in Europe. Across the globe, our teams kept pace with tremendous growth in Europe, Brazil and North America, which as John mentioned, is still experiencing operational and logistical inefficiencies given a tight U.S. industry and higher than anticipated growth in Brazil. The unfavorable impacts of U.S. aluminum scrap, logistics and customer ordering complexities have largely been addressed in contracts renewing in 2020 and beyond. Before I move on to the segment commentary, a brief update on some internal talent moves. After decades of successfully leading numerous Ball regions, we recently brought Colin Gillis over from Europe, and he will now be leading our North America operations. And Colin's European role will be backfilled by Ron Lewis, who is joining Ball from Coca Cola European partners, where he was their Chief Supply Chain Officer. Ron worked in the coke system for nearly 20 years, and we have known him throughout that time. His experience and leadership will be a great addition to our team. Moving to the individual segments, Ball's North American segment volumes were up 4% in the quarter, continuing double-digit growth in spiked seltzers, wine, craft beer, new water brands and developing categories of fitness energy drinks and spirits and premixed cocktails, and cans led to year-over-year growth and specialty. Inventory levels for our specialty portfolio are low and every plant in our network is running at maximum utilization. Given the combination of strong growth, the upcoming transition of traditional products such as still water from single-serve plastic to cans, the demands on our existing operational assets are such that we will not be able to sustain current growth rates without additional investment. Conversions, wind speed ups and additions at existing facilities in Georgia and Texas are in process. We look forward to offering new products and more specially aluminum can and bottle capability to support our customer's growth. Following these investments, our plant teams will gain some operational breathing room across the system, allowing us to get costs in line and with previously negotiated contracts favorably resetting at the beginning of 2020. I fully expect strong earnings momentum across North America in late 2019 and beyond. Turning to our South American segment, volumes were up 12% in the second quarter, led by incredible strength in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, the completion of the [ENS] manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction led to just slightly lower second quarter earnings. Higher than anticipated Brazilian volume growth led to incremental logistics costs. Comps will improve as we move toward the fourth quarter, which is the seasonally strongest quarter for South America. Our expansion in Paraguay is on track for late 2019 startup and the 2018 expansions of Argentina and Chile or performance expectations. And similar to North America, overall, South American industry trends remain strong with cans. New products and brand launches for beer, wine, energy and still watering cans as well as multiple brewery expansions will support additional investment across the industry and specifics of all a new customers multiple brewery expansions will support additional capital in Brazil, including a multiline greenfield facility. Europeans beverage earnings were up 16% in the second quarter due to volume growth and improved year-over-year operational performance despite a 5 million unfavorable operating earnings translation impact in the quarter. Volumes increased 7% in the second quarter despite mixed weather during the quarter. Cans are winning and customers operations continue to add new can filing lines. For 2019 contributions from our new lines, the year over impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and plant cost initiatives will provide further year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion as we progress through the balance of the year. Looking ahead, we will leverage our existing Continental Europe network with near-term line speed ups. While in Russia, we are executing a capacity expansion strategy in the short, medium term to support in country can grow. Turning to EMEA and Asia, the demand environment was softer than anticipated, as Middle Eastern conflicts escalated in the quarter. Operationally, the plants have lowered their costs and focused on controlling what they can control. And as John mentioned in China, Ball has secured antitrust approval and has begun the multistage closing process for the Chinese manufacturing plant sale to ORG. In summary, global beverage can demand momentum has continued in our three largest regions of North and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply demand globally for cans is tight and our commercial sustainability and recent talent moves will benefit Ball going forward. As John mentioned earlier, the amount of growth we are seeing today and are securing into the future is amazing. We will invest wisely with an eye on EVA returns and a proper pace relative to customers long term needs. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks Dan. Comparable second quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share was $0.64 versus $0.58 in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 results reflect $0.04 comparable earnings per share diluted impact of the July 2018 sale or U.S. steel food and steel aerosol business. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage can shipments and solid aerospace contract performance. A lower effective tax rate and lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. steel food and aerosol business and low lower year-over-year end sales in South America and U.S. scrapping startup costs as Dan just outline. Net debt ended of the quarter of $6.5 billion and reflects our typical seasonal working capital build and ongoing share buyback. We continue to anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as the buyback stock and invest in our businesses and pay dividends throughout 2019. Close to 90% of Ball's balance sheet debt is a fixed rates and we've reached our post-Rexam target leverage levels. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and provides ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs. As we think about 2019, our 2019 financial goals originally laid out in mid 2016 are largely intact. With the North American scrap and operational headwinds that we faced in the first half, that makes the full year $2 billion of EBITDA challenging to hit. Having said that, our second half expectations haven't changed as the scrap and operational headwinds begin to moderate and our unit volume growth continues to show strength. We'll exit this year on a $2 billion EBITDA run rate. Given all the excellent growth opportunities and dependent on the pace of CapEx spend and incremental pension funding, we see 2019 free cash flow being in the range of $1 billion. Full year interest expense will be a little bit more to $310 million. Full year effective tax rate and comparable earnings will be in the range of 19% to 20% and corporate undistributed will likely run just under $75 million, representing benefits from strong overall cost management and the benefits of our shared services structure. We anticipate benefiting from this low cost structure in 2020 and beyond. Year-to-date, we've executed nearly $400 million of repurchases of stocks and paid out approximately $80 million in dividends. The accelerated stock repurchase program that we announced earlier this year continues to be executed. Following the year-to-date run up in the stock, we get asked a lot about capital allocation plans. The significant long-term growth opportunities we have in cans, cups and aerospace will require growth CapEx over time. And despite this growth CapEx, we continue to flow meaningful amounts of free cash flow like always we will manage for the benefit of our long-term shareholders, when you invest in volume, you invest with us. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business which is now reflected in other non-reportable results, and as I mentioned earlier, global volumes grew 1% in the quarter. Industry dynamics are beginning to change and we continue to see opportunities to broaden our global footprint either through bolt-on M&A or greenfield investment. These opportunities varied by geography. We are proud of the progress the team is making on innovation and sustainability initiatives. As I mentioned, our aerospace business reported 31% revenue growth and 58% operating earnings growth on solid contract performance partially offset by incremental labor costs. In addition, we welcome nearly 600 new aerospace employee year-to-date and we anticipate adding at least another 600 employees by year-end. Total aerospace headcount recently surpassed 4,200 people. Our focused remains firmly on on-boarding these new employees, further expansion of our Colorado facilities and executing on our strong backlog. Looking forward to the new two-year U.S. budget agreement further underpins the growth that we see, and aerospace now has the potential of growing its earnings in excess of 20% 2019 and with contracted backlog levels exceeding 2 billion and our won not booked backlog at 4.8 billion, the future continues to look bright for the foreseeable future. While we make great strides towards the 2019 financial goals originally laid out mid-2016, our longer term prospects have never been brighter. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in a global aluminum packaging and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders. We look forward to receiving our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal in 2019 and over the next several years. While we're striving in the short-term to manage costs and squeeze as many cans at our existing operations, we're completely immersed in our long-term growth plans and increasing value creation for our shareholders. Our ability to succeed is because of our people, our culture, EVA mindset, our healthy balance sheet and exceptional products and technologies. We will continue to responsibly invest in our businesses for the long-term and do what is best for Ball and our shareholders long-term success. And with that, Lila, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: John, the view that you'll be able to grow earnings beyond the 10%, 15% EPS range over the next few years. I guess what kind of volume assumptions underlie that on the bev can side? And can you give us any detail on maybe customer commitments you secure that give you confidence that you'd be able to reach that volume number?
John Hayes: First, with respect to volume growth, as we said in the first quarter, historically, we always thought this business to be plus or minus globally about a 2% unit volume growth around the world and we think it's double that. We've been outperforming that relative and I think in the very short-term, we can continue to see that. But I think over the long-term, 4% unit volume growth is a good way to think about it. And if there's upside to that, we're going to be spending more capital, because we assume it's going to be good at EVA return projects to meet our customer's needs. In terms of specific customers in the contract, we don't get into anything. But for example, the new plant we're building in Brazil is secured by a new long-term customer. In North America, here we've been, as I mentioned in my comments, we've been leaving growth on the table because we haven't been able to serve incremental. So the demand certainly is there. We just need to get our supply caught up, so we can get a little breathing room and give our operational folks more opportunity kind of slowdown the conversions as they've been experiencing, which have been increasingly short-term, which happened increasing the short-term headwinds that we talked about.
Anthony Pettinari: And then, Dan, you talked about 55 million of headwinds in the quarter from operational inefficiencies, and you broke that out between North America, Europe and LATAM. Any view on what that number could look like in 3Q? And then just directionally, would you expect those headwinds to abate in all three of the regions that you mentioned? Or could they intensify or be relatively stable, say on that in 3Q?
Dan Fisher: I think we're very hopeful that the 35 in North America in particular will dissipate. And we've got plans in place on the metal scrap issue that will start to trend in a more favorable direction. It will still be a headwind year-over-year, but it'll be less of the headwind than we saw in the first half. The performance in our inefficient lines, we had two conversions that took place in the quarter. And then we still have, we're still a little behind on two lines and the Goodyear startup. We're seeing progress there. So I think that momentum will continue through the quarters. I don't know if it dissipates entirely in 3Q, but it will continue to progress in the right direction heading into certainly beginning of '19. And then really, Europe FX that we described, I probably can't give you much guidance there. And the 15 million that I quoted or the $14 million in South America is, that will dissipate in the second half the year the last as it relates to the [ORG] amortization.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Ghansham Panjabi: First off on the 13% increase in specialty can volumes in 2Q. John, can you sort of break that out by region? And then you also mentioned growth came in above your expeditions for the second quarter. And I am sorry if I miss this, but which region in particular surprise you to the upside?
John Hayes: Well, I think the momentum continues to answer your question. First, in North America, especially volumes were all single, upper single digits. As I said, they could have been higher, but we just didn't have enough cans to get out in the marketplace. I know, South America was very strong, was low 20% growth, in the specialty and even in Europe we're seeing a lot. What, fundamentally what's driving this, as you're seeing all these new categories and all these new products moving to the specialty containers and that's what we get most excited about. Ghansham, as you know over the past 5 to 10 years, we've really been a put a focus on putting supply of specialty containers into our system. And that only continues to accelerate. I think to answer your broader question about where were we surprised. I just think overall, global growth in a very seasonally strong quarter up 6% of you exclude China. And when you think about that and we left growth on the table for, we could have very, if we had the capacity, we very easily could have replicated the first quarter. But we did. And that's why you're we're talking about putting more capital in.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, then just based on your current projects you know that you've announced including line speed, speed up and debottlenecking. How much incremental capacity will your footprint generate in the developed markets going into 2020? And then up the new categories that you're benefiting from, how is the filling location dispersion different relative to your legacy customers? I'm just trying to get a sense as to how logistics costs are different for these new customers. And also, it may impact your capital allocation plans willing to join the new capacity going forward?
John Hayes: Yes, I would say by mid 2021. What we're signaling here is somewhere between $4 billion to $5 billion of additional capacity. And the reason 2020 is a difficult comment for us is I think, in Texas specifically that is the most difficult environmental permitting area that we deal with anywhere in the world. So, you can't even start civil engineering projects until the permitting, is officially signed off and that could take as long as the year. So 2021, I've got good line of sight that the new facility the two lines and the speed ups that are all in process will be up and running. And we should be executed against those by mid-2021. Maybe 60%, of what I've described falls in the second half of 2020.
Scott Morrison: So, the best way to think about it, if you break it into line speed up versus lines versus new facilities, kind of a third, a third, a third is the best way to say it. Line speedups will -- that will be able to help us out for most of 2020, certainly in the summer selling season in North America. And as Dan said, the lines between the lines are putting in North America. One, we have a pretty good line of sight that should be able to help in the second half of next year. And then the other one in Texas is dependent upon the permitting. And then as we go into South America, thinks it's really more for 2021.
Ghansham Panjabi: And just the new categories in the filling locations? Thanks so much.
John Hayes: Yes, definitely benefiting from new categories in North America. And the one of the investments will be targeted to a new filling location. The rest of the incremental investments will be falling into existing filling locations.
Scott Morrison: And Ghansham, as you know, we don't talk about specific customers, contracts and/or growth plans, but we are aware of a variety of specific customers that are adding, filling, can filling, capacity whether it's North America, whether it's Europe, and we're dovetailing our geographic investments with those. And so, there have been some customers that have been, having to buy cans from us, and one geographic location, ship them across [audio gap] country to another one where they fill it. We're aiming and looking to work with them on streamlining a lot of that. So, it will not only help us but it will also help them.
John Hayes: I think one last question on the new category expansion or one last comment is. We absolutely are looking at what products and what customers are winning in the market and which months we want to be with. And those definitely played into some of these expansions and investment call us.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please go ahead.
Edlain Rodriguez: John, question for you. I mean, you'll be adding new capacity. Your main competitor is adding more capacities, like gaining concerns that the industry may be attracting too much capital too soon, or do you feel that volume will be strong enough to absorb it all over the next couple of years?
John Hayes: We feel pretty darn strongly that the growth in the various markets is more than sufficient to cover that up. As I mentioned, just giving context here. In North America, it's approximately 100 billion can market has been growing at 4%. That's 4 billion cans right there alone in any given year. You multiply that over a couple of years and next thing you're looking at 12 billion of new capacity and that's 8 to 12 new line. That is why we're getting out ahead of me as you all know we've invested depends on where you look, but across our whole system globally, we've invested in 11 in line so we're last 18 months and we've been able to keep up with live growth, but not completely old. And so, what we're doing is this is just the next phase trying to get out ahead because I know we believe strongly that by 2021, that in given everything that our customers have been talking about that's in the pipeline right now that we see this growth continuing. And that's not even talking about the broader picture of this whole anti plastic sustainability and that continues to accelerate. This is where we're going to be talking about more capital as we go forward, also.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay, and in terms of capital allocation, so that new and all those investments you're making. Are they going to be coming at the expense of share buyback? Or do you think you can still do that $1 billion that you've talked about over the next couple of years share buyback?
John Hayes: Here is the way we think about it and I'll turn it over to Scott a minute, but when you talk about this growth, as we all know, we've talked about this. Our DNA is approximately $550 million. And we set our maintenance of no growth capitals in the range of $250 million. We've also said people have asked over time and how much does it cost for new line and it varies tremendously by region and what capacities you want to put in. But if you say up roughly, a new line is approximately $75 million. And you get anywhere from 800 to a 1 billion cans on it depending on how many swings you have in that. That means to keep up with this growth on a global basis. You're talking about a growth for us on a base of 105 plus 1 billion cans as growing 4%. That's about four new lines a year. And if it's a 75 million, that is about 300 million. So you later on top of that, you get 250 maintenance plus 300 of growth, that gets about DNA, then you layer on the growth that we have for aerospace. And then you grow on cups and other things even quickly see how we get the kind of 700 million. If that global beverage can growth continues, and we need to put more in, we have the capacity to because then I'll turn it over, Scott now. Even with all this elevated CapEx, we're still generating a tremendous amount of free cash flow.
Scott Morrison: Yes, I think we're going to continue to invest in our business on all these projects where we can grow EVA dollars grow our earnings, we're going to continue to be buying back or stock paying dividends. I think the 50% increase earlier this year is pretty strong evidence of that. And I think we'll be both kind of a consistent buyer of our stock, but also an opportunity to repurchase of our shares and take advantage of volatility. And so that means that any quarter to we may buy more or less depending on that volatility. But we're going to continue to invest in our business and return a lot of capital back to the shareholders.
John Hayes: Yes, let me just reiterate, over the last 20 years, we have done that exact same model. We've invested in our business. And we've generated a tremendous amount of our shareholder, value for shareholders by being consistent allocators of capital back to our shareholders. Yes, we have elevated CapEx, which is exciting, because that's going to provide the growth. And we also have the flexibility to be consistent, and over the long term and returning value to shareholders.
Operator: The next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the commentary. I just wanted to ask a question kind of a point of clarification to start. The additional 4 billion to 5 billion cans of capacity Dan that you said you think you'd get to on an annualized basis by mid 21. Does that include capacity, does that include within the number for aluminum cups or does it not? And similarly, I thought it would have, but given John's commentary earlier. Does that include anything for any of these still water conversions or not?
Dan Fisher: I would say cups. No, it's not in there. And still water conversions. That's it. We don't have much built into that 5 billion. And as you imagine, George, we're having very different conversations with the customer base. All the 3 major markets are incredibly tight. And so if there was going to be a move in the water, and there are certainly conversations about that. It will require some significant collaboration between us and our customers to make the supply chain, they'll have to invest in doing, they'll have to invest in potentially different logistics structures and warehousing, and we'll have to add capacity for him. And so those conversations would be in very early innings right now.
George Staphos: And I would take it probably not prudent to size what the opportunity could be either for cups or for still water, maybe not 21, but 22, 23, because it obviously, so you don't have a full agreement yet on the water side. You can't bring in permitting. You can't bring in CapEx yet. But is there a way to size what it could look like maybe in 22, or 23?
Dan Fisher: Yes, I'll let John comment. It would be difficult. It's a massive market. I think single-serve waters 500 billion units and global cans is 300. So, a 2% move, 3% move would require a very different investment pattern for us. On the cup side, we are commercializing the product. It will be in some sporting venues now. The thing that we're trying to get our head wrapped around is exactly the outputs that will come from a massive line or footprint, expansion. We're working through those and those details right now. So given you commentary on the specific volumes for the investment still a little premature, but we'll know that the next 60 to 90 days, I think.
John Hayes: Yes. George just amplifying, the cups are completely agreed on the water side. But just on the cups as I mentioned in my comments, around the world in terms of the addressable market for this, it's over 90 billion units, a third of which are in the United States. This will come at a premium aluminum's not inexpensive, but what we see is so far is a very strong willingness to pay a premium for a sustainable product, particularly as college campuses and professional sports venues go plastic free.
George Staphos: Understood. I thought that some of the investment and lines that you're talking about now would include some capacity for cup is that incorrect. So if, I know, you're commercializing, you're doing some pilots this coming football season. Am I mistaken that if you really go full force with this, that the investment really hasn't been lined up yet for that, those revenue streams?
John Hayes: Yes, that is correct. We have already put in a pilot line that we're currently serving for this fall, but to really scale it out. It requires a new investment that we have not announced yet.
George Staphos: Okay. Thanks for all the back and forth on that. Last question on investment and I'll have one shorter term one, and I'll turn it over just out of fairness. So, the return on capital that you're seeing out of these new investments, is there a way to say whether it's, perhaps a lesser rate than what you've seen, but you're getting so much growth, you're willing to take a lower return than what you've seen in the past? Are the returns on these new projects equivalent or above? What you've seen with returns on your last two or three year's worth of growth CapEx? And then separately and maybe shorter term, given all the growth you're seeing, what gives you confidence, which is the investor takeaway is why we should be confident that the startup costs and all the other variable expense that's been sort of a record has been something that will dissipate by 2020. Is it mostly in the contracts? Or is it the learnings that you're getting from all of the work you're doing right now? What would it be? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Thank you. I'll answer the return question. First, the conversations that we're having with our customers are very different. I think John indicated this. And that is resulting at least all the projects that we've approved thus far or at North of historical norms returns on these projects. In Europe, North America and South America, the markets are tight. And so the conversations are, in many of those markets that used to have excess capacity, they're just very different. And so we should be doing better from a returns threshold standpoint at this point. Fair question and I think when John indicated, the three buckets of capital investments or how will get units, the easiest units to get our speed ups and conversions, the second most difficult are our full line expansions and the third are greenfield. And where we have admittedly struggled, whether it's Monterrey or it's Goodyear or it's Cabanillas over the last couple of years, we generally had an 18 month time horizon on seeing the commercialization of the products and getting up to a run rate. And I think it's probably going to take a little longer than that. And we'll probably communicate that more explicitly. One thing that we do know that we have to spend a hell of a lot more time on training. And the other thing and some of these markets, these are the first -- in North America, Goodyear is really the first market where we built a greenfield plant in 30 something years. So, we will get better at it. And I think we'll hire better. I think we'll train better. And we're fully committed to that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Good morning. Thank you. I think you just mentioned from the sustainability, you really haven't sort of seen a benefit yet then you kind of mentioned just Northern Europe, you're starting to see some customers convert from PET to can. Can you just talk about how significant that move is? Or just provide a little more color on that?
John Hayes: Yes, well, this is John. Maybe I'll turn over to Dan. We didn't say we have got a better from sustainability. All these new products, I think are being driven by sustainability. What we haven't seen in any meaningful way, is existing brands that are already in existing substrates converting to aluminum. We -- there have been some public announcements by customers, we are obviously aware of other investments that they're making for those conversions. And that's what gives us some conviction as we look forward into it. I do think that many brand owners are struggling as their retailers are demanding more sustainable products, and a reduction of their footprints, both environmentally and from a greenhouse gas perspective, and they're turning to products such as aluminum, and that's what I was talking about. You're absolutely right. In Europe, you're seeing it. I think you're starting to see it in North America. I think someone asked a question earlier about, how big could that be? We're in early innings. So, it's too early to tell, but so far so good in terms of what we've seen.
Tyler Langton: And then in terms of the corporate expenses, Scott, I guess, I think 16 million this quarter having a low-20s. Is that 16 million a good run rate going forward? And is that mainly from sort of the shared services initiative?
Scott Morrison: It's a ton of different things, but our run rate should be pretty good. I said it it'd end up kind of just under 75 million for the full year. We're benefiting -- we're doing a lot of things whether it's restructuring, legal entities. Some of the things we've done in pensions, shared services, it's all those things that are adding to that, basically lowering our costs that will get the benefit, not just this year, but into the future.
John Hayes: Let's not forget a couple of years ago. We talked about over the 2018 release, latter half of how '17, we're going to actually be making investments in standing up shared services, and we should start to get the benefits as we get into the second half of '19. And that's exactly what we're seeing. But to Scott's point, that's just one of it. There're hundreds of different projects that all incrementally may not look that exciting, but cumulatively they start to add up.
Tyler Langton: Final question in terms of CapEx, most of these projects and most of that, in 2020, just kind of how to think about CapEx for this year?
John Hayes: Yes, I think CapEx, we initially set around 600 million for CapEx. I think it could be more than that. I think next year could be a little higher than this year. And all of these projects, we just approved at our board meeting a week or so ago, 350 million of capital to be spent over the next 18 to 24 months to add capacity across our beverage system and another 150 in our aerospace business to keep up with the growth in that business. So I think we could spend a little more than 600 this year, and I think we'll spend a little bit more than that next year.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Just wanting to understand that the outlook statement of EPS growth of greater than 10% to 15%. It sounds like volume's potentially trending a little bit better than you thought. You also discussed contract renegotiation in the statement and the release, but you have experienced quite a bit of cost. So is it implicit in that statement that contract renegotiations and pricing improvements and mix is going to more than offset the logistics issues and the cost and that your inflation you're experiencing? Or is it a greater pivot to buybacks as well? Or maybe you can just sense what kind of goes of that segment.
John Hayes: Well, qualitatively, and I'm not going to hash through all the numbers because I think we've in one way shape or form talked about them already. But number one, we've had a variety of headwinds that we said, we're going to dissipate, certainly, as we get into the back half this year, but more importantly, going into 2020. So that's a source a year-over-year improvement. We also have unit volume growth that is much stronger than we historically have seen and/or anticipated. And the mix of that more specialty is a kicker on top of that. So that's a big data point relative to our historical 10% to 15%. You think about the growth and aerospace that we've been going it's been growing much stronger than we've historically have. There is other thing as well, but those and then you're talking about the new capital we're putting in and we're an EVA company, so we better darn well, we generating returns on that. So, you put all that together, and absence, just normal share repurchases, you can see your line of sight of why we feel bullish on the next few years.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And then just from another perspective, I'm just wondering South America, you guys experiencing very good growth there hasn't been some extra capital is coming there though. Any concerns that growth there could slowdown eventually and with new entrants and a little bit more capacity? Thanks.
John Hayes: Yes, we're probably less concerned about the new entrance just more concerned with the volatility of the region. But the reality is the movement and I think the things John, we've talked about this historically, but what you're seeing an accelerated growth rates in North America and in Europe is the sustainability impact. What you're seeing in South America, which is a real tailwind, and it should continue for some period of time obviously given the macro environment is remains somewhat healthy. If it's a shift from returnable glass, by the largest incumbent to cans meaningfully and they're making significant filling investments to support that. They have last year or the last two to three years in that marketplace by premiumization of beer and all of that going into specialty aluminum packaging. And so they have made a conscious decision to move away from returnable glass. And so that's why you're seeing these accelerated growth rates in that marketplace. And they're committed, as best we can sell to doing that for a long period of time. So we like the growth trajectory in that market in particular. And also further underpinning it over the last few years, we've actually seen very strong growth, but that was despite overall consumption of beverages to be down. I can tell you years in the second quarter 2019, beer, total beer consumption, irrespective of what package type it was in, was up by 2% software and was also up by 2%. That's the first time in a long time, those have been positive. And so we had good growth underpinning with negative overall volume. And now it's turned positive, then you layer on with and so that's why we feel constructive over the next several years.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And last follow-up on free cash flow. Assuming that you do grow EPS in the 10% to 15% or above range, given that your investments look like increasing your CapEx outlook, would you expect slightly lower free cash flow growth? And how should we think about that?
John Hayes: No, not necessarily because I think we'll get -- As Dan talk about, the projects that we're investing in and the mix of those projects gets better. And I think the earnings acceleration will offset some of the growth in capital over the next few years. So I don't necessarily seen free cash flow are going to be hit as we go forward.
Dan Fisher: Yes and the other thing I'd point out is actually, cash flow from operations is going to be growing quite strong. And when you really think about free cash flow is a function of the cash you generate from running your business, less the maintenance CapEx, you need to support that business and then plus or minus growth capital and that growth capital could be M&A, it could be Greenfield investments as we talked about. So, we actually over the long-term that growth investment is a one-time type of thing, and so yes, in 2019 or 2020 or '21, we may have elevated CapEx, but it's one time growth CapEx that's going to accelerate the free cash flow from operations.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Kyle White: Just curious if you guys, what kind of volume impact you saw from the weather conditions in the quarter? And then what have you seen in July, any impacts from kind of the heat waves that we're seeing?
Dan Fisher: No issues in North America, I assume that's where the questions coming from, but we did see in the second quarter, kind of some dissipate about as good as our volumes were in Europe, the weather wasn't on our side and that is certainly turns so. But from a weather perspective, as long as it's not over 95 consistent, people are going to drink candy products. I mean, that's kind of the temperature range we usually see.
John Hayes: And then standpoint in Europe, we did get qualitatively, the volumes were quite strong. But we do think that they were more muted than they otherwise would have been because of bad weather. You go into July it's actually got incredibly hot. So, it's almost too hot for people stay indoors, but having said that volumes continue along the growth pace that we've always talked about. So there's for different reasons, it really hasn't impacted it over the longer term, we're going to have short-term dislocations because weather good and bad.
Kyle White: And then turning to aerospace continues to grow nicely. The won not booked backlog close to about 5 billion. Can you just provide some details on these backlogs and kind of the typical timeline that we should expect them to materialize into one contract and materialize into actual sales?
John Hayes: Yes, it's truly across the board when you look won not booked. We have things such as I'll just give you 2 book ends. We have on one hand, the shorter term in that is contracts we have one for specific satellites with specific customers in the classified arena that because the government didn't have a budget, they couldn't sign an agreement. Now that budget is behind us, it significantly improves the prospects over the near term that we will go on contract and that will move from one not booked into a funded backlog status. On the other stream, we do all the sensors that are on the fuselage and wings of the F-35. That contract will go out to 2030 or 2040 in the various lots that we have produced. Some of them will move in the short-term to from one not booked to funded backlog. Others will stay out there for a number of years as these planes continue to be built. So those are just two extremes. And there's hundreds of programs in it that have similar characteristics within those parameters I just laid out.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. The line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley is now open and interactive. Please proceed with your question.
Neel Kumar: Sorry, I was on mute. I just had another question on aluminum cups. Do you have a preliminary sense of what the receptivity of customers is to cups and aluminum versus plastic? And are there any other new revenue opportunities outside of beverage cans that you're considering?
John Hayes: Maybe I'll take the first one. We've done a bunch of quantitative and qualitative research that says. This could be very -- there could be a lot of upside here. I think what we've seen at a high level that people see the experience of the container as much better than all the existing alternatives, they see a colder, they see a sturdier, they see a willingness to pay more as a result of that. And so everything that we've seen says, yes, there could be a lot of interesting upside in here. And as it relates to other innovation innovations, we always have other innovations pretty consistently revolve around the markets in which we currently serve. And so this is for beverages. I would not anticipate us going into food, for example, which consciously made the decision to exit that, but we have a lot of things in the pipeline. Now, Dan, do you anything to add?
Dan Fisher: I would say, I mean, obviously, you're presenting this in kind of the entertainment space and food service space. And look, we are a 100 for 100 in terms of the percent of showing this cup to a potential customer and then wanting to place an order right now. We're turning down and we're allocating is what we're doing. But where you'll see this is entertainment venues, and you'll see the sports venues where there is a massive push to have a green facility.
Neel Kumar: Very helpful.
John Hayes: It further helps leverage us on the college campuses, for example, because when college campuses in terms of sustainability, that is probably the greatest area, when you think about demographics, you think about people 18 to 25 years of age. So those are probably the, those that are most conscious about sustainability. And when college campuses talk about going plastic free, yes, they can convert their soda. Yes, they can convert your beer. Yes, they are starting to convert their water, but they never had an alternative from us in terms of costs. Now they do. And so that's what we've been talking about them using this as an opportunity to accelerate going plastic free that their customers being the students are asking for.
Neel Kumar: Great. That makes sense. And I was just wondering if you can also update us on how sustainability conversations with customers have been progressing aerosol. I recall you mentioned those conversations started surfacing in the space in the first quarter of this year. So any update there will be helpful.
John Hayes: Yes, as I said in the first quarter and it kind of continues, there is discussion but it's further behind the beverage category. I think sustainability and recycling in the personal care space is more and more difficult. They have many more resins. They have many more colors within those resins. And so, as they try and think about how they're going to deliver their products in a sustainable world, it's just taking longer, it's much -- I won't say easier, but you can see a have a much more clear line of sign when you're talking beverages, and you see what you need to do. I think it's a little bit more challenging when you get to the aerosol side, but I still think there's great potential. It's just we cannot point to you right now any specifics like we can in the beverage. Any specifics in the aerosol sides that we said that is a direct result of sustainability.
Neel Kumar: Okay, and then just lastly. With specialty can growth of 30% and global volume growth of 5%, your portfolio make is about 43% seems to imply that traditional can volumes came down during the quarter. Is that generally a fair characterization that all the growth came in specialty cans?
Dan Fisher: Yes, overwhelmingly. I mean, relatively flat, some slight decline especially in EMEA and Asia contributed to that, but almost overwhelmingly all the growth came from specialty and that's what you, that's what was reflected in that mix.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Brian Maguire: Good morning everyone. John, back at the Investor Day, simply a long time ago now back in October. You've talked about just one of the challenges in adoption of the cans historically was just the difference in the price point at the retail level between the beverage bottles in PET for example versus aluminum cans. Just wondering, as you've seen this take off in growth, how you think customers are getting around that? And presumably input costs are up, you're doing an admirable job of renegotiating contracts to capture the value you guys create. Do you see customers being able to kind of price appropriately to maintain or improve margins on cans? And just a general kind of how do you see the growth and specialty helping customers with that price conversation?
Dan Fisher: This is Dan. Good question. I think this lends itself to, when I think when John describing this. He's really talking about kind of core brands shifting out of high margin packaging, and it was established, because higher retail prices as they put on those packages and plastic. The growth that we're seeing is coming in specialty packages, new products. Those are still being launched by the large CPG companies. And they're being launched at a far greater rate. And I think we've been touched on it's basically 2x, the amount of new product launches in both North America and parts of Western Europe that are going into cans versus the historical rate of about 35%. Those products are -- they're able to garner a higher price point, which is -- has not been much of a conversation because they are in some of these emerging categories like fitness energy, spiked seltzers. So, they're able to step into cans with new products at really nice margins. And although they probably won't say this, they won't say it publicly. They also don't want to compound an issue in their supply chain by putting more plastic into that supply chain. And that's why we're inferring there's absolutely a correlation to sustainability.
John Hayes: And the only thing I'd add on top of that is even with the existing grants, which I was specifically talking about. Dan's absolutely right. That's why especially growth is going so much. But let's not forget, there's many of our existing brands, they have put packaging and whether it's a 7.5 ounce here in North America or 250 ml or 150 ml in Europe. And they've been able to ride that price curve up to reduce and/or eliminate the retail price per fluid ounce delta between their plastic offerings and their specialty can offerings.
Brian Maguire: And your comments just about the forward look on can opportunity to, maybe take some share from other substrates in those traditional markets. Are we at the point where the concerns around customer perception on sustainability overwhelm more challenging retail price point or the fact that cans costs more than plastic? You mentioned you haven't seen much benefit today from such substitution, but the forward look sounded positive there. Are we just seeing your inner conversations with customers that really sustainability is trumping economics in these new decisions?
John Hayes: They won't necessarily say that directly, but what we do know is the investments in cans going lines are happening at a massively accelerated rate versus historical norms. And we also know that some of our major customers are putting in a lot more cans filling capacity over the next two years. So, the combination of those two would suggest that there's absolutely contemplation that they need to get out ahead of this for a potential move whether its regulation or they're willing to take a slight margin dilution by moving into aluminum. I think there's -- in addition to all, but I think there's a recognition of the consumers requiring it that's the most important thing.
Operator: So the final question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Chip Dillon: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on the cup introduction that you're going to roll out. Obviously, the water bottle is very similar to an aluminum beverage can for beer, let's say, but the cup there is different concept, and I just didn't know if you were able to use similar machinery or if you had to go out and either put something together on your own or buy a different type of technology or set of equipment to make aluminum cups.
John Hayes: Yes, great question. What I'd say is there's parts of it's similar but a good chunk of it is very different. This has been in development for nearly seven years within Ball. And we think there's a lot of proprietary to this, that we'd rather not disclose. But, it's very easy to make cups when you're banging in about 100 or 200 per minutes, but the key is to do it at scale to get to a price point that actually opens up the market. We think we've done that and that's why we started with a pilot. We wanted to test it with three or four weeks in the pilot. Things are working well with brand new technology in parts of it. And so, I think it's a -- and that's what gives us a lot of hope, but it is it's similar but different than making a beverage can.
John Hayes: Okay, Lila. Well, thank you very much for everyone's participation, and we look forward to a great second half of 2019 and as we go forward. Thank you all for your support.
Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Ball Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, participants are in a listen-only mode and afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is recorded on Thursday, May 2, 2019. It's my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir
John Hayes: Great. Thank you Emma and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and COO of Global Beverage. I will provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for the company. Overall, we were pleased but not satisfied with our quarterly results, with overall global beverage can demand up over 8%, which is the highest it's been in a very long time and our aerospace business continues to deliver on its growth ambitions. Offsetting this growth was the previously mentioned conclusion of the end sales agreement as part of the Rexam acquisition in South America and some short-term incremental costs that weighed on results in North America. Dan will address these transitory costs related to efficiency headwinds for two of our new lines in our Goodyear, Arizona facility and the impact of aluminum scrap costs in his comments later. We expect volume growth to continue while our costs become more in line as we move through the year. Now key highlights for the quarter include, as mentioned previously, overall global beverage can growth of approximately 8% with specialty can growth of approximately 20% and standard cans flat, further highlighting that our focus on specialty cans is paying off. In fact, specialty cans now represent over 43% of our mix on a global basis, which is up from 30% in 2016. The growth was across the board with North and Central America up approximately 6% year-over-year, South America up a bit more than that and Europe and EMEA up in the low to upper teens, respectively. Our customer discussions about shifting products into cans from glass, plastic and multilayer paper-based containers have only accelerated and Dan will go into more detail about what we see going forward. In addition, we received the antitrust approval of the sale of our China beverage can business and we are on track for second half 2019 closing. Aerospace revenues were up over 20% and while we don't expect this level of growth to continue, we do expect revenues to be up over 15% for the full year. Finally, aluminum aerosol was up low to mid single digits as the sustainability discussions migrate to this segment as well. Now speaking of sustainability, Ball has focused on a variety of efforts over the past number of months to raise awareness on sustainability, educate consumers on the benefits of aluminum packaging, aid customer shift to cans and proactively improve our own environmental footprint. Key initiatives that we have focused on year-to-date include engaging with customers, governments, NGOs and others on the sustainability advantages of aluminum packaging, including presenting at the World Ocean Summit in Abu Dhabi, supporting employee-led recycling and community cleanup events around the world and launched new events in Argentina and the Persian Gulf, just to name a few, launching a campaign to educate youth about recycling, if you can, choose a can, facilitating various sports and cultural venues to shift to aluminum packaging, including utilizing Ball's reclosable aluminum bottles for still water, developing new infinitely recyclable brandable aluminum cups for use in stadiums, venues, colleges and other channels where plastic cups are used and to make Ball and our products even more sustainable, announcing agreements to transition 100% of our North American energy usage to renewable sources by the end of 2021, making Ball one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the U.S. As we go forward, we see the momentum growing in each of our businesses throughout this year. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing EVA dollars and earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, by focusing on our value over volume strategy, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace, all with the return of value to our shareholders' mindset. And with that, I will turn it over to Dan.
Dan Fisher: Thanks John. And as John has already highlighted, we had some pluses and minuses to start the year. On the plus side and without a doubt, sustainability is having a favorable impact on customer demand and given customer conversations, it will in the future as well. On the minus side, certain inflationary costs to respond to the surge in volume growth cannot be fully offset in the U.S. given the aluminum scrap market spreads and a couple of new lines not quite hitting our targets. Turning to growth. Our first quarter global beverage can volumes were up 8%, though comparable operating earnings were down 6.5% year-over-year due to the $33 million impact of the previously disclosed completion of the South America end manufacturing agreement, which will anniversary in mid-2019 and the late year 2018 U.S. line inefficiencies continuing in the first quarter. We can and we will do better going forward. Across the globe, our teams kept pace with tremendous growth in Europe, Brazil and North America, which in some regions created some operational and logistical inefficiencies given the tight U.S. industry and higher than anticipated growth in Brazil. The impact of widening aluminum scrap spreads in the U.S. has highlighted an area of exposure in certain customer contracts, which will be or has already been addressed for agreements renewing in 2020. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North America segment volumes were up 6% in the quarter. New categories led the way with wine, spiked seltzers, energy, crafts and water experiencing double digit growth and lower calorie light beer being stronger than year-over-year. Given the strong growth, we experienced higher than anticipated line conversions in our new Goodyear, Arizona facility which, in a start-up environment, created higher cost than anticipated. This combined with the aluminum scrap issues described earlier, dampened our results and while headwinds related to scrap will continue until we can fully pass these on, we expect our operating performance to improve as the year goes on. Turning to our South American segment. Volumes were up 11% in the first quarter, led by incredible strength in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, the completion of the end's manufacturing contract, required as part of the Rexam transaction, led to lower first quarter earnings and higher than anticipated Brazilian volume growth, led to pockets of suboptimal logistics patterns to honor customer demand. Comps will improve as we move forward with second quarter segment earnings down just slightly to reflect the mid-year anniversary of the end's agreement completion. Our expansion in Paraguay is on track for late 2019 start-up and the 2018 expansions of Argentina and Chile are contributing to results. Overall, the South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories. Looking forward, we see additional customer conversions from returnable glass to cans, aiding growth in 2020 and beyond. European beverage earnings were up nearly 7% in the first quarter on difficult year-over-year comps, given the timing and location of the 2018 World Cup, a $5 million unfavorable operating earnings translation impact and start-up costs associated with two new lines and multiple specialty line conversions in the quarter. Volumes increased 10% in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2018. Cans are winning as customers shift their package mix into cans. As a result of new can filling lines being installed across our customer's operations, we look forward to continued good market growth. For 2019, contributions from our new lines, the year-over-year impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and plant cost initiatives will provide further year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion as we progress through 2019. Turning to EMEA and Asia. The demand environments in Turkey and India improved and operating performance in our Saudi joint venture stabilized. And in China, Ball has secured antitrust approval for the Chinese manufacturing plant sale to ORG. In summary, global beverage can demand remains robust in our three key regions of North and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply/demand globally for cans is tight and commercial and sustainability initiatives will benefit Ball going forward. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I will turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks Dan. Comparable first quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.50 in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2019 results reflect $0.03 dilutive impact of the July 2018 sale of our U.S. steel food and steel aerosol business. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global can volumes and solid aerospace contract growth, a lower effective tax rate than expected offset by the sale of the U.S. steel food and aerosol business and lower year-over-year end sales performance in South America and U.S. cost inflation, as Dan just outlined. Net debt ended the quarter at $6.5 billion and reflects our typical seasonal working capital build and ongoing share buyback. We continue to anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as we continue to actively buyback stock and pay dividends throughout 2019. Close to 90% of Ball's balance sheet debt is at fixed rates and we have reached our post-Rexam target levels. We have an additional $850 million of stock to buyback by the end of 2019. And in 2019, we will pay roughly $185 million in annual dividends, which reflects last week's dividend increase. Looking forward, the company remains committed to repurchasing the shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions and we will closely monitor growth trends and growth CapEx returns to determine how much additional growth CapEx will be spent beyond 2019. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and our recent amend and extend of our credit agreement provides ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs. As we think about 2019, we continue to strive for full year comparable EBITDA of $2 billion, free cash flow in excess of $1 billion after CapEx in the range of $600 million, full year interest expense a little north of $300 million, with full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 22% and corporate undistributed should be just under $100 million, which is roughly flat with 2018. By investing in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on M&A, repurchasing stock and paying quarterly dividends, we continue to put the cash machine to work for the long term benefit of our fellow shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business, now reflected in other non-reportable results and as I mentioned earlier, global volumes grew 4% in the quarter. We continue to see opportunities to broaden our global footprint. Sustainability is also a driver in this business as some consumer product companies pursue aluminum alternatives to plastic. We are proud of the progress our team is making on innovation, operational improvements and employee engagement to further improve this high-returning business. Our aerospace business, as I mentioned earlier, reported 24% revenue growth and 20% operating earnings growth on solid contract performance, partially offset by incremental labor costs and the start-up of many of these new contracts. In addition, we welcomed 300 new aerospace employees in the quarter and we anticipate adding another 600 employees over the next 12 months. Our total aerospace headcount recently surpassed 4,000 people. Our focus remains on onboarding these new employees, readying the facilities for further expansion and most importantly, executing on our strong backlog. Now as we look forward for the company, we are one quarter of the way through the year and while we still have much to do to achieve our 2019 financial goals originally laid out in mid-2016, our longer term prospects continue to be bright. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace while also continuing to return significant capital to shareholders, following the Board's announcement to raise the quarterly cash dividend by 50% last week as well as our recent $50 million share repurchase authorization. We still expect to acquire $1 billion of stock in 2019 and we look forward to exceeding our long term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal. All of this is possible because of our people and our culture. We will continue to do what's best for Ball and our shareholders' long term success. And with that, Emma, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: John, you got a couple of quarters where it seems like you have had some growing pains in terms of meeting a stepped up pace of demand and I am wondering just from a big picture perspective if we are moving to a world where bev can vols are maybe closer to mid single digit growth and low single digit. How confident are you that, not only Ball but really the entire supply chain, whether it's the aluminum producers or your freight providers, are going to be able to kind of meet that higher level of demand?
John Hayes: Yes. It's a good question. Two things. First as it relates to Ball, recall, the acceleration of this growth has happened really right as we were in the midst of optimizing our footprint. So we had a number of plants that we were taking down over the last year or so in a number of lines. In fact, 11 lines, I believe, across the world over the last 18 months or so. And so any time you have this growth much higher than you are anticipating, when you are going through change, it adds risk to it. That's a little bit of what's happened. We are largely out of it as we look forward. We probably will have a little bit more in the second quarter. But as we move to second half of this year, we really expect to see all the benefits that we said. On a broader basis, from a supply chain perspective, you raised an excellent point because I am confident in our ability to make the cans, but what we are increasingly focused on is on the filling side of our business, making sure there's enough filling capacity to fill the cans and more importantly on the metal side, making sure there's sufficient metal globally but even regionally, particularly here in North America. The tariffs that were implemented about nine months ago haven't helped the situation. And we have gone from a situation where we had four or five metal suppliers that we relied on increasingly, we have doubled or tripled that, if not quadrupled that, given the shortage of aluminum, rolled aluminum here in North America. So that's added complexity into the whole system. And we have been working very diligently with all of our key suppliers to make sure that they have sufficient capacity to realize that the growth is endurable, it's sustainable and it's here right now.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then is it possible to size the earnings drag from the scrap spread issue that we could see in 2Q or maybe the remainder of 2019? And then I think Dan indicated the issue will be addressed or has been addressed in customer contracts. Is it possible to say how far along you are in that? And you have some contracts that are three to five years. Is it something that's going to take multiple years? Or just any thoughts on that one?
Scott Morrison: Yes. Anthony, this is Scott. On the drag on the first quarter, the scrap issue was probably about $10 million in the U.S. and it's really only a U.S. issue. That will continue in the second quarter, but it gets better in the second half as some of our supply gets switched to different suppliers and becomes a little more competitive. And I will let Dan talk about the customer side.
Dan Fisher: Yes. Anthony, I would say on the customer side, I would say about 25% to a third of our North America business has this exposure in 2019. Two-thirds of that has already been contracted. The other are basically annual contracts that get renewed at the beginning of 2020. So it's within our control to re-up those contracts with a very different pass-through mechanism.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. I will turn it over.
Operator: Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. Thank you. Good morning guys. A quick one on sustainability. As you look ahead over the next couple of years and if we believe you, as the can gains market share, like how do you take advantage of that, given that you practically sold out? Are you contemplating capacity expansion projects in all the regions? Like how do you take advantage of the higher growth?
John Hayes: Yes. Well, we actually have seen this coming for the last 18 months. We have been talking about it for a couple of years and we truly believe the acceleration of it is actually going faster than we had thought. But recall, as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we have invested meaningfully in our business to prepare for it. And so as we sit here in the short term, we are very confident that we have the capacity. What we are more focused on is actually the whole supply chain, as I said earlier, the filling side as well as the metal side. I think longer term, meaning beyond 2020 going into 2021 to 2023, we see a variety of opportunities, but we are only going to be investing in that capital if we can get the appropriate returns. So maybe I will let Dan talk a little bit about the granularity there.
Dan Fisher: Yes. And I think, just to piggyback on that and maybe it's a more nuanced view, John has talked multiple times even at the Investor Day about needing to move our customers in PET that need to move, they also need to make sure that they get profit pools reestablished. And so when you look at our specialty growth just on the first quarter year-over-year, that's where a lot of that movement is happening. And we were up 20% in the globe on our specialty volume growth. Remember, over the last two years in the footprint reestablishment, we have taken out 12-ounce capacity and we have added back in specialty in anticipation of selling this through to our customers and it's starting to come to fruition. Now it's happening, candidly at a faster rate than we anticipated. And to John's point, we are constantly looking at our footprint for investment opportunities with customers and the returns have to be there in order for us to step into those.
John Hayes: And just to give you one last context. As part of our planning process, Dan and his team has really looked out not only two, three years but looked out 10 years and really looked into every one of our facilities and said where are those areas of low-hanging fruit, if you like to call it, we can speed up lines? What are those facilities that we can add lines into the existing bricks-and-mortar? And then where are those areas that we need to look outside? So we have a very good idea of short term and long term incremental capital and big capital, where we could invest if we get the appropriate returns.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. And one quick one on Brazil. Like are you gaining market share at the expense of glass? Because it seems like there is some dispute between what you say and what the biggest glass competitor is saying over there?
Dan Fisher: Yes. The answer is yes, from returnable glass. And what is happening in that market is, that market is transitioning to premiumization. There's been a couple of new market entrants over the last couple of years that have moved to pure malt, that have upgraded their ingredients profile and they have exclusively gone into cans. So the predominant player in that marketplace that overwhelmingly has a majority of returnable glass share, is having to change their ingredient profile on their beer composition and they are having to address from a competitive response standpoint, they are having to move to cans. And that is going to be an appreciable movement over the next three to five years. And so in the comments, when we said demand was ahead of what we thought, it's all playing into the response from the incumbent there and moving more into cans.
John Hayes: Yes. One other data point just on the first quarter and this is Nielsen data, but overall beer consumption increased a little over 1% in Brazil while can demand increased 20%-plus. That's just on the beer side. On the soft drinks side, consumption declined a couple of percentage points and can demand actually increased 1%. So that, by definition, means the can is taking share from other packaging substrates.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Matt Krueger: Hi. Good morning. This is Matt Krueger, on for Ghansham. How are you?
John Hayes: Good. How are you, Matt?
Matt Krueger: Good. So first, I was just hoping that we could take a drag around the globe and just take a look at what your budgeted volume growth outlook looks like by region for 2019? And if there's any notable factors that we should consider as we move just in terms of the quarterly cadence of layering in that growth.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think where we were this time 100 days ago was, we thought kind of mid single digits in Europe, South America and maybe a little north of that in North America. I think North America is more or less in line with what we thought. Of course, we are in April here heading into peak season or May, sorry, beginning in May. South America has moved a little bit ahead of that and so has Europe: South America, based on the comments I made on the last question as it relates to beer and the premiumization and the shift to cans in the Brazilian market. And then in Europe, it was really an energy movement and continued shift, I think, in sustainability and all that. I don't have a lot of data points to suggest that. But the growth rate certainly was ahead of what we anticipated. As long as weather holds in the northern part of Europe, we feel like we are poised for some decent growth ahead of that 4% or mid single digit growth.
John Hayes: Yes. Matt, your question is also, I think, is a more important one longer term because I think the megatrends around sustainability. This is not just a 2019 event. I say that because we have had more conversations with existing customers who are talking about converting from other substrates into cans. But more importantly, we have had the most number of conversations with new customers that have never been in cans that want to convert. And whether it's the spiked seltzers, whether it's some of the categories Dan mentioned or even still water, which we are seeing very strong interest in as this whole sustainability issue rises to the top. And so I think this is a multiyear, if not decade, type of conversion that will play out.
Matt Krueger: Great. And then understanding that you are entering this higher growth phase in the business, can you talk about what your targeted operating leverage is across these new sales volumes that you are seeing? And then how do you think you are performing currently with all the start-up costs, et cetera, versus your ultimate kind of operating leverage goal on that new business?
Dan Fisher: Yes. Well, I think in North America, as we said, I think we can do better. I would think we should be at historical levels, if not a little better, if we can extract kind of the commercial benefits that you should see with the supply/demand market that's as tight as we have. The challenge, fundamentally in North America, just to take a step back and walk through what we have done in the last two years, we have closed multiple facilities and we have started up seven new lines here in the last 18 months and that's not an insignificant challenge. You throw on top of the fact that what John just indicated, where we probably moved from a half dozen metal supply programs into roughly 20, that's coming from all parts of the world. So I think managing that, focusing more on the supply chain, getting that stabilized and as you said, moving into this kind of growth paradigm, not only with our supply base but our internal employees and our processes, I think we should be performing at historical leverage fall-through.
Matt Krueger: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Continuing on, we now have a question from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on, I guess, Europe and South America. I mean if the growth is kind of mid single digit plus this year, with your current capacity, can you support that for the full year? Or would you need to either speed up lines? And sort of would you expect, if you had to do that, I mean are there any sort of cost headwinds associated with that?
Dan Fisher: No. Great question. We fundamentally have gotten through it from a capacity standpoint because keep in mind, we are just leaving peak season. So as we head into the fourth quarter next year, that will really be kind of pre-build, et cetera. And so we will be fine for the next six to seven months. I am actually heading down there in the next two weeks to go through a pretty extensive footprint analysis on that very question. But as John already indicated, if we are not going to get the returns, we are not going to add capacity. But yes, we will certainly, heading into next year, if we see growth rates at this particular juncture, we are going to have to look at incremental speedups, et cetera, potentially on the backs of this movement or the substrate mix that continues to kind of candidly surprises us a little to the upside.
John Hayes: Yes. Don't forget also that, Dan's comments were directed largely towards Brazil, but don't forget that we invested in a new line in Argentina as well as Chile last year. And we will, in Paraguay, are having a new facility start-up late this year. So that's actually helping us to bridge some of that gap.
Tyler Langton: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just with Goodyear. I know sort of like two of the lines are taking a little bit longer to ramp up. Can you, I guess, give a rough estimate of how much that's costing you in sort of executions for the balance of the year? And then does that, I know it was always the goal was to get $50 million of benefits from Goodyear this year. I mean is that something you can still achieve for the year? Or with these pressures, does it get pushed out a little bit?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think the cost drag in the first quarter is $5 million and that should decline as we move through the second quarter and hopefully will run in well as we get to the back half of the year. Full year, the $50 million, we are a little bit behind in where we wanted to be. But we have every intention and every expectation that we will be able to realize the net benefit when we get up and running. And remember, the two lines were overcomplicated by having to switch sizes on those large two. So that's difficult when you are starting out and you have got a new workforce. So as we smooth out that production capability, I think all of that gets better and gets to our original expectations.
Tyler Langton: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.
George Staphos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
George Staphos: Good morning Dan. So I guess the first thing I wanted to do is come back to the comment and it's been touched on a few of the other questions and answers, on I think, Scott, you said monitoring CapEx relative to returns. So I think in some ways that's self-evident what you are seeing. But can you talk about how that might play into the other cap allocation goals that you have for the next couple of years, including the buyback that you have talked about? And when would we see from you that you have enough visibility, one way or another, in terms of monitoring that CapEx and what it means for 2020 and 2021?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I don't see that our CapEx needs are going to change our return of capital to shareholders. We had a nice bump in earnings this year. We are going to get a nice bump in earnings next year. Our leverage is down at three times by the end of the year. So we could definitely spend more capital and still buy $1 billion of stock. I am not overly concerned about that. We have the good fortune, George, you have been around a long time, where we have been able to invest in our business, do M&A and return a lot of value to shareholders. And I think now we just have a bigger cash engine to be able to do that with. So we are not and in terms of incremental capital, Dan talked about his trip to Brazil. We have got another meeting here in the next week to talk about all that, to John's comments about incremental capacity, where we could speed up lines. So it's too early to tell where that might be and what that might result in. But rest assured, we will be putting capital in the ground where we are going to get sufficient returns. And I think it's going to add to that earnings machine that allows us to continue to buy back and return a lot of value to shareholders.
John Hayes: Yes. And let's not forget, George, also just our goals for 2019 is $1 billion of free cash flow and that includes $600 million of CapEx. And that $600 million, our maintenance, state-of-the-art maintenance CapEx is probably in the range of $350 million. So embedded in even the $1 billion of free cash flows is $250 million of growth. And so if you just extrapolate that out with a growing cash flow from the earnings, you can see it may be plus or minus a little bit, but it's not a big mover.
George Staphos: Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. The second question I had and again, it's been touched on a little bit in some of the other Q&A, very helpful. On the one hand, we hear from the other substrates about how they are finding they need to educate the consumer. And this has been of our premise. It's kind of a battle for the hearts and minds of the consumer here that's important in terms of plastics versus paper versus glass versus aluminum. If you buy the premise of this, how do you maintain aluminum's advantage when everyone else is now ramping up their "education process"? What makes you comfortable that you don't lose what's been an advantage to-date? And relatedly, Anthony touched on this in his question, how do you maintain the security on the supply chain? And specifically, what are the aluminum companies telling you right now about their willingness to invest in more can sheet capacity when the last few years they have talked a lot about auto and other things that they claim to make more money on but obviously are a little bit more cyclical?
John Hayes: Yes. George, let me take the first part and then I will turn it over to Dan on the aluminum supplier side. Let's remember this, to the consumer this is not about cans versus glass versus plastic versus paper. This is about sustainability and doing right for the world. The aluminum beverage can, far and away, is the most sustainable, from a recycling point of view, both in terms of its ability to be recycled and the economics about recycling. The consumer gets that. So unless something fundamentally changes there and we keep our ears to the ground and eyes to the ground quite often on this, unless fundamentally something changes there, I think the aluminum can is always going to win out and I believe the consumer is seeing that. Now as it relates to the aluminum supply and aluminum suppliers, Dan, why don't you take that?
Dan Fisher: Yes. George, good question. As you can imagine, we are having a number of conversations with our supply base. And I think the comment that you introduced in there is something that they are very well aware of. Maybe they weren't aware over the last two to three years. But the movement in the automotive, it's massively cyclical. There is a slowdown afoot. And I think there is a growing desire to find another diversification outlet to put capital to work. Some have, it's a more difficult discussion than others because they are so wed, to save time, publicly with some of the automotive statements. But it's clear that there are a number of folks that are absolutely willing. And keep in mind the return thresholds on that in a tighter supply/demand market. We are having very different conversations with them, longer term conversations. And I think they are seeing a very different tone and tenor out of us. They see the upside of the sustainability message. And I think folks are going to be willing to put some capital to work.
George Staphos: My last question and I will turn it over. When we look at some of the incremental costs that you have incurred this quarter and expecting until the second quarter because of the growth in the can, thank you for parsing the details on the aluminum credit and the like, is there any embedded cost that is non-variable and for which you could not get out of easily? In other words, have you needed to hire more people? Is there more fixed costs that you have built into the beverage can business because of the growth outlook that doesn't necessarily step down quickly 3Q and 4Q? Thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Yes. George, the short answer to that is no. There's nothing structurally that has changed related to that. As you rightly pointed out, these have been just short term growing pains.
George Staphos: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.
Neel Kumar: Hi. Good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
Neel Kumar: In terms of your customer conversations, has there been any changes in terms of the customer order patterns this year versus last year, where it seems some money was left on the table because the industry was placing more adjustment time inventory orders?
Dan Fisher: Yes. There's definitely been. And I think there's a couple of beer companies and alcohol companies that have substantially outperformed expectations. They have changed their buying pattern in North America. We have had a number of really good conversations. You can even see it on the balance sheet, we are carrying kind of record levels of inventory right now in anticipation of peak season. So we are in a much better position. Now whether or not we have placed the right bets with our customers on which products they are going to sell through from Memorial Day through Labor Day, well, that's kind of always the gamble, right, in terms of peak season in North America. But I think we are in a lot better position heading into peak season than we were on previous years.
Neel Kumar: That's helpful. And then related to the beer market. We saw a pretty strong pickup in alcohol can shipments in North America the past couple of quarters. Has there been any improvement in the underlying beer market that you have seen? Or has that really just been driven by substrate switching?
Dan Fisher: Not a lot of improvement in the beer market. There was one of our customers that probably did a little bit better branding and pass-through and had some easier comps year-over-year. And they have also changed their, you can see it in their advertising, they have changed to multiple can sizes in specialty and sleek formats. So I think that's all helping. But what we are seeing is and we have talked about it probably for the last couple of years, the big beer houses, they have woken up to the fact that they need to sell what the end consumer wants. And they have done a really nice job of pushing out new innovative products, alcohol related. But whether it's the seltzers or different kombuchas or different types of spiked cocktails or mocktails, all of those are continuing to win in the marketplace. And I see more innovation, not less innovation, as John indicated, more into cans. And so we are excited about all of that going forward.
Neel Kumar: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks and good morning.
Dan Fisher: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Gaffner: Dan, as we look at the volume growth in North America first quarter and sort of fourth quarter of last year, obviously accelerated. Because it is coming, a lot of it, from new product launches, how much of that is really based on underlying end market demand versus your customers filling the channels based on these new product offerings? Just trying to get an understanding of the sustainability of the growth at that particular level.
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think it's definitely selling through. Good question. It's not channel stuffing. And the other thing and I think John indicated with this is, as it relates to sustainability, a couple of years ago, new product launches in North America, the can would take roughly 30% to 35% of the share of all new products from a package mix standpoint. It's now moved closer to 70%. And so it's not just the new products. It's that the new products are overwhelmingly going into cans. They are selling through. Now some will sell through and some won't, right? And we will have to deal with that added complexity. But the reality is, it's like where we see the most appreciable sign of the sustainability movement. It's not necessarily a shift from existing products that have been regulated out. It's all the new products that are coming out. They are innovative. They are new. They work well with various can portfolios and different applications from that standpoint. And that's where we are benefiting from. But right now, it's overwhelmingly the spiked seltzers and things that have gained a lot of traction last summer. It has distribution space and it's selling through. I would continue to see that through the summer.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. And then when you look at the manufacturing footprint, I mean, going back to one of the previous questions on operating leverage on new volume. I mean, clearly or not clearly, but maybe you can just tell us, I mean, Goodyear, I would assume, is one of your largest if not the largest facility that you have. Is there opportunity on a go-forward basis, as you continue to invest capital in some of these regions to have more centralized production such that you could maybe leverage some of the volume growth a little bit better than you have historically?
Dan Fisher: There is definitely an opportunity to do that. It's all going to be about, it all relates to what is the product and what's the end market price point of that product and how much freight can that product absorb. So if it's $3 a unit on a shelf and it's an energy drink, they can absorb a heck of a lot more than a $0.99 still water product. And so that comes into the equation on that. But leveraging fixed cost, multiple lines, multiple conversions, leveraging your staff, leveraging your overhead structure and candidly leveraging your supply chain and your inventory levels, all of those things will become more and more embedded in how we think about expansion moving forward.
John Hayes: Yes. And Scott, this is John. The other thing that we like where we are and we have talked about this, in all the three major regions: North America, Europe and South America, our network of footprint is by far larger than anyone else. And so we have the ability to look at incremental speed-ups in those 20 or so facilities in North America versus a new line and where to put that. So you have network effects of all those things. It gives us more options and more levers to pull as we are thinking about where to make product and where to ship product.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks for the color. Just lastly, John, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned lack of filling capacity or filling capacity coming online slower than maybe demand for cans is coming up from the consumer. Intra-quarter, there was an announcement about you co-investing with one of your customers around filling capacity. I mean, should we start to see that more and more co-investing on filling capacity so that you could ramp up your customer's capacity at the same rate that the end the market is ramping? Thanks.
John Hayes: Yes. Well, a couple of thoughts. Number one is what you are specifically referring to, recall that Ball is not really putting any real capital in. What we are doing is creating enablement. Enablement for our customer to be filling and enablement for us to actually have the cans to be filled. And so I would expect that, much like we talked about the whole supply chain, I would expect that you should think that we are thinking about the whole supply chain on the filling side and on the metal side as well. Whether or not the investment, we make investments into that is all about our core businesses making and selling and marketing cans. So it's an enabler and can, on a standalone basis, generate good economic returns, we would certainly consider that.
Scott Gaffner: Perfect. Thank you.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.
Connor Robbins: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Connor Robbins, sitting in for Brian Maguire. I just wanted to back to the 2019 reiterated guidance there. Obviously you mentioned some of the headwinds with Goodyear as well as some of the aluminum scrap stuff and then maybe tracking a little bit less than that $50 million benefit that you expected from Goodyear. Just wondering if there was any other offsets that you guys expect in maybe another segment to bridge to that?
Scott Morrison: Yes. For the full year, I think aerospace continue to do extremely well and probably has upside from what we originally thought. I think the European market is doing really well. We are getting hurt a little bit from a currency standpoint as it translates back into dollars in Europe, but I think that will do well. We are seeing very strong demand we saw in South America. And EMEA and Asia are doing okay. So I think across the board, our businesses are probably in better shape now, absent the softness that we had in North and Central America. But all the other businesses, including aerosol, are probably better across the board than where we were coming into the year.
John Hayes: Yes. And I will just make one final comment on it. Obviously, we put out our 2019 goals way back in 2016. We are not running the company only for 2019. We are running it for 2022, 2024, 2030. This is a long term sustainability play. While we wish some of these short term headwinds related to the aluminum as well as the Goodyear start-up, we wish they had not hit us. They did and it's reality. But we are focusing on maximizing the opportunity both short and long term for our stockholders.
Connor Robbins: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one other on some of the specialty can growth. It seems like you guys mentioned there's some pretty strong growth there. But you did mention in the press release, mix metal costs to serve some of the double digit specialty can growth in that North and Central America segment. Just wondering if this is more related to operational items? Or is there maybe not enough capacity that you guys have that's outpacing some of the demand expectations you have? Or just kind of a little more color there.
Dan Fisher: No, the two lines in Goodyear have multiple can sizes on them. And yes, we are not running as we anticipated and that certainly contributed to some challenges in terms of needing to get those cans from other locations, out-of-pattern footprint, running more over time in locations. So a collective drag by not having those two specialty can lines running where we thought they would entering the year.
Connor Robbins: Okay. Great. Thanks for the details. I will turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on where we are in the sustainability adoption period. I guess it appears that growth has been a little bit quicker than expected. I guess what are your expectations for volume growth across different regions, I guess, going forward? Do you see that moderating? And has there been, say, a pull-forward on the sustainability front? Thanks.
John Hayes: Well, I think we covered this a couple of times earlier on this call. We think we are in the early stages of a long term secular change because of sustainability. And I do think that as we look forward over the next period of time, then we can debate whether it's three years, seven years, 10 years. You are going to see a lot more of the sustainability debate in front of us. And it's our job to try and capture with the most sustainable package in the world, capture as much of the incremental growth from new products Dan was talking about as well as conversions, whether on still water or other things that have a very, very low exposure to cans currently. There's a huge long term opportunity for us in every region.
Arun Viswanathan: Yes. So it's fair to assume that, I guess, global bev can growth should kind of remain in the 3% to 4% range for a little while. Is that fair?
John Hayes: No. I think we have said over the past year, we think over the long term, without sustainability, depending on region, it's anywhere from 2% to 4% growth. So what we are saying is, at a minimum, that's just the upper end of that growth and it could be a little bit more depending on how things break.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Great. And then just a quick question on capacity. I guess this aluminum can sheet has been tight for a while and it looks like it will be again just given this growth and I guess same with can capacity as well in North America. Where do you guys come out on investments there? Do you think more investments on the can sheet side will be coming? And similarly on the can side itself, how do you kind of view supply/demand right now or the supply in North America? Thanks.
Dan Fisher: Well, I mean, supply from a rolling metal standpoint, we are importing metal right now. So yes, there needs to be capacity increases. There's plenty of metal capacity, but managing boats and different supply chain levers all around the world is not the most efficient and the most agile way to do that. So we are in a number of conversations to help our metal supply base, figure this out along with us. We will continue to invest in this. We have seen it for a couple of years. The reason, again, that we are up 20% in specialty growth is we have made significant investments over the last 36 months on specialty line investments. So we are able to step in at some of these opportunities. As John has indicated and as Scott's reiterated and I am telling you again, we are looking at EVA-accretive opportunities and investments and there are a number of conversations going on with the customers right now. We will continue those. We are not going to put any money in the ground unless we get an appropriate level of return.
Arun Viswanathan: Understood. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.
Mark Wilde: Hi. John, I wondered, first of all, if you could just put a little more color on exactly how that three-way joint venture in Arizona is working? I think I heard you say you weren't actually putting any capital into that business.
John Hayes: Yes. Let me tell you what I can in a public forum. There's been a great relationship between this customer, their filling partner and us as a can partner. And so we have entered into a filling operation. And you know any time you make a manufacturing facility, the best way to optimize the economics is think about the throughput and maximize the throughput of that. I think there's going to be third-party filling capability in this as the customer ramps up and that third-party filling capability. We know those customers that need to fill cans that may not be the customer that's investing and they are allowing us and the joint venture to pursue those. So we are in charge of the third-party filling of the demand from that filling location.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's fair. And when I think about just Red Bull and juices, which I think are kind of the two products that have been announced, is it fair to say that that plant is probably going to be running a very high proportion of specialty cans?
John Hayes: Yes.
Dan Fisher: Although exclusively.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then when we were out in Boulder in early November, I think you made a real point of talking about how the can manufacturers need to help replace the kind of the profitability that a beverage company might have in other packaging formats like PET bottles right now, which are very profitable for the soft drink companies. Where are you in that process, you think, of convincing them that these alternative formats that you have got can replace those profit pools so that they end up being made whole?
John Hayes: Well, I think the greatest proof point we can talk about is the 20% global growth in specialty and the flat standard 12-ounce volumes. And so your question is really better answered by our customers that are actually putting it on the retail shelf. But we have given them, there's a reason why we make over 40 different sizes and it's giving our customers variety so they can look at whether the package is right in a 7.5-ounce container, a 10-ounce container, a 12-ounce, a 14-ounce, a 16-ounce and everything in between. And so we are going to continue to do that. And that's going to mean, as Dan has mentioned earlier, that's going to mean more complexity. And we need to get paid for that complexity. But if it's helping the customers improve the profit pool of aluminum as the consumer is demanding more aluminum, good things typically should happen.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And last thing along this line. It just seems like the craft beer market has moved pretty rapidly into cans and it seems like they have held their pricing. So I am just curious, do you think this is having an effect, let's say, on these Mexican beer companies that are still shipping to the U.S. predominantly in glass that they look at what's going on with craft? Craft has gone into cans and its held premium pricing such that maybe we will see more of the Mexican beer moving into cans?
Dan Fisher: Yes. I think the one particular customer that you are probably talking about, we have a really strong relationship with them. Keep in mind, there's a ton of, there's an iconic image associated with that particular bottle. And I think there's some real, they believe there's some real market value associated with that. That being said, almost all of their new products that they are introducing are all in cans. And so it may not move appreciably the one core product that's in glass, but everything else that they are launching from an innovation standpoint is coming in cans. And we are in constant contact with them on an innovation standpoint. So your point is valid. I just think some of these iconic shapes are very difficult for a marketing organization to move from appreciably.
Mark Wilde: Yes. Understood. I know what that image is.
Dan Fisher: Yes. We are drinking more of those. I am sure it's the same when the weather warms up here.
Mark Wilde: Yes. All right.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Wilde, for your question. Continuing on, we now have a question from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Ms. Jones, it appears your line is muted. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Debbie Jones: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about aerosol, a couple things on that. You mentioned kind of a low to mid single digit growth. I am assuming that's in line with kind of industry trends. We haven't talked about it a lot in a while here. So I wanted to get an update on that. And then what do you think the opportunities are from the sustainability perspective in terms of categories where you could see growth from that? And then lastly, just as this fits into your portfolio, is it something where you would expect it to become a bigger part of Ball over the next two or three years. Or the opportunities in beverage cans are really dominating the capital allocation from an EVA approach?
John Hayes: Yes. Let me try and tackle those quickly. Number one, yes, it's in line with, overall, the industry growth that we are seeing as best as we can tell. Number two, I do think the whole category that aluminum aerosol plays in is probably further behind the sustainability journey than the beverage world. And I say that for a couple of reasons. There still is a tremendous amount of plastic in the personal care markets. That plastic is even more difficult to recycle because it's often different resins and multiple resins. And so I do think that the opportunity for the aluminum aerosol category to grow relative to the other substrates, is even perhaps greater in that but it hasn't caught on yet as much as beverage. And last but not least, it's difficult to answer your question about will it become a bigger part of our company or not. From a pure organic point of view, if this was a couple of years ago, I would have said yes, probably. But when you have 8% global beverage can growth, we look at it as a bottoms-up issue, not a top-down issue. So we don't target things to get bigger or smaller. I would have said aluminum aerosol has relative growth profile that was better than beverage cans. But if I had said that several years ago, I would have been proven wrong.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Then the next one is -- go ahead.
Dan Fisher: And Debbie, building on John's comment there, you go into a grocery store within North America, you have two aisles that are beverages. You have got 15 aisles of cosmetics. They are all in plastic. We have a number of conversations with retailers on it. They see the issue. They see it coming and they need help. And so I think there will be more and more opportunities in spaces that are tangential, that we can bend metal and we can handle different apertures, et cetera, that we can step into. Those are, to John's point, it's not moving as fast as the beverage side of things, but stay tuned.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And I guess I wanted to ask about the comment you made about the aluminum cup. I guess that it's pretty early stages, but you did mention it on this conference call. So I was wondering if there's any encouraging signs that you are seeing? And also just to get a sense of what type of capital is involved with something like this.
Dan Fisher: Aluminum cup.
John Hayes: The aluminum cup. Dan, do you want to take that?
Dan Fisher: Yes. We are making really good progress from a development standpoint. We have made investments from a pilot standpoint, Debbie. We will be launching it into a -- we will be commercializing it this fall on some college campuses and some entertainment venues. Moving forward, there is a ton of conversations and commercial appetite for it. We have hired a dedicated general manager for that business and we are building a team in and around that. It's full speed ahead. It's similar in terms of the economics to a can line, maybe a bit more and almost very similar to the output of a can line just in terms of the economics. This is very early stages. We haven't solidified that. But in the engineering, drawings and things that I am seeing to really step up the capital investment, the good news is we will have an opportunity to leverage some of our existing infrastructure and overhead structure to pilot that. I will let John fill in more on some of the other things that are happening on that.
John Hayes: Yes. Strategically, we are very excited because on its own merit, there's a huge opportunity. But there's also a lot of leverage because many of those venues, whether it's college campuses or sports stadiums or museums or other things, as they talk about trying to go plastic-free, cups are a big part of it and beverage containers are a big part of it. And they don't want to just do one or the other. They want to go plastic-free. This provides us a portfolio where they can completely dedicate their beverages to going plastic-free and that's what's exciting about this.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Thanks for the update. I will turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Thanks everyone. Good morning. Just one more on sustainability, Dan or John. Do you know what the recycled content of the aluminum you are buying is? And consequently, what the recycled content of the cans you are selling is? I have seen some data on Can Central and the like, but I am just wondering if your suppliers actually give you that information.
John Hayes: Yes. It's not the right way to be looking it, to be quite honest because aluminum is fungible. So you can take an aluminum can, melt it down and it can go into a bicycle frame or it can go into a window frame. And so I do know that, to answer your question directly, well over 50%. It depends upon the supplier. But well over 50% is recycled content. But I would strongly encourage everyone not to be thinking of that because 100% of aluminum is recyclable and can go into a wide variety of products. And that's why there's such a great benefits, recycling benefits of aluminum.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. And John, I think you said on the last call, your customer negotiations for next year were nearly complete. Could you give us an update on the status of those negotiations? And consequently, what type of commercial benefit you are expecting next year and beyond, if possible?
John Hayes: Yes. There really is no update relative to what we said 90 days ago. And I said we are still in the documentation. So when we have something to tell you that's more than what we have, we will tell you.
Adam Josephson: Thanks for that. And Scott, I think you mentioned earlier, you are expecting earnings to be up nicely this year as well as next year. Can you just give us a little more context for that comment? Is that just based on volume expectations or otherwise. Just I think you talked about next year as well and I just wanted to flesh that out a little bit.
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think we will be able to fix the issue that we are having around scrap in next year, with the contracts that we are entering into. I think we will get out beyond the learning curve of some of these start-up lines and plants that we are experiencing this year. I think we will see more volume and more growth across the business and weighted more towards specialty. And some of those new commercial contracts kick in next year. So I think all of those things lead to improved results, nicely improved results as we get into 2020 and 2021 and 2022. And so we are in a pretty good spot and we are pretty excited about the future.
Adam Josephson: Thanks Scott.
John Hayes: Emma, this is John. If there is one more question, we will take that, but we are over our allotted time.
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. We actually do have one final question. This comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead, sir.
Chip Dillon: Hi John and Scott. Good afternoon now for us. Thanks again for all these great details. No one, I don't think, unless I missed it, asked about aerospace. And you talked about such a huge potential backlog. And it looks like this year, a reasonable place to be, last year, you did $1.2 billion in revenues, maybe this year is over $1.3 billion. What kind of years could we see in 2020, 2021, when you talk about especially that shadow of $4.9 billion? I know it's lumpy and it gets spread out. But can you give us some parameters around that?
John Hayes: Yes. Thanks, Chip. You are a good wingman for us because aerospace is very, it's an exciting time. And you know that's a long-cycle business. And what I mean by that is the visibility is much further out because of the won not booked and because of the contracted backlog. What I would tell you is the growth profile we see this year, we see continuing for the next couple of years at a minimum. And that's kind of over the next three to four years. So you should expect kind of a 15%, 20% growth and with comparable margins as we go forward on it. So it's really exciting. We continue to bid on things at a rate faster than we ever have before. We continue to grow the people and the facility side at a rate faster than we have ever done before because we see the opportunity set as we moved from components and sensors to full satellite, become a full mission partner for our customers. Those trends are only continuing. So as far out as we can see, these trends will continue.
Chip Dillon: And will the mix, either in terms of type of customer and I know mostly that's U.S. government, will that change? And will the character of the contracts be materially different, that is the mix of fixed price versus cost plus?
John Hayes: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. You always have nuances. But from a strategic point of view, they should not.
Chip Dillon: Okay. All right. Thanks for the help.
John Hayes: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you sir. And Mr. Hayes, I will turn it back to you to continue your presentation or for your concluding remarks. Thank you, sir.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you Emma. Thank you for everyone participating. We look forward to accelerating our momentum as we move to the second half of this year and we appreciate your continued interest.
Operator: Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you. Have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer-session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 31, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s full year and fourth quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company’s news releases. If you don’t already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today’s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Global Beverage. I’ll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we’ll finish up with some comments on our aerospace business as well as our outlook for the company. 2018 was a strong year for Ball and its shareholders. Strong global demand for our aluminum beverage and aerosol packaging products, growth in our aerospace business and a strong long-term focus on earnings and cash flow performance allowed us to return approximately $850 million to our shareholders, which was well above our original expectations dating back to 2016. Our fourth quarter results were slightly below in our own expectations due to some transitory issues in our North America and Central America beverage segment that Dan Fisher will comment on. Yet as we look forward, we like the position we’re in. We have good momentum in terms of our volume growth. We’ll begin to reap in earnest the footprint activities that we have implemented and largely completed. We have a clear line of sight to achieve the $2 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow that we set out as a target in 2016, we just need to execute. And all of our free cash flow will be returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2018, we continued to actively adjust our overall manufacturing footprint. And since we closed on Rexam acquisition, we’ve rationalized eight facilities globally with four in the U.S., two in Brazil and one each in Germany and in Italy. We started up three state-of-the-art beverage can facilities in Arizona, Spain and our joint venture in Panama to cost effectively meet growing demand in these regions. We’ve installed or are installing additional specialty can capacity with new lines in our existing facilities in Argentina, Chile, Switzerland, Serbia, Texas and Mexico in addition to a number of other smaller speed-up projects. We’ve grown our aerospace backlog 26% to over $2.2 billion, while also growing headcount by over 35% to approximately 3,700 people and the company continues to expand our aerospace infrastructure to meet growth of this important segment. We’ve divested our U.S. steel, food and aerosol business into a 49% owned joint venture and realized approximately $600 million in cash. And we announced the sale or Chinese beverage can business. As we look more deeply into 2019, we are on the cusp of achieving better value for our standard beverage can products as the majority of our negotiations for the next 18 months are largely concluded which much of this value to be received beyond 2019. We are well invested to capture global growth for our specialty product portfolio. We are benefiting from the final phase of initial acquisition related cost-out programs. We are embarking on additional efforts to streamline global processes. We are commercializing the sustainability benefits of aluminum packaging to provide our customers solution -- solutions versus environmentally challenged substrates. And we are initiating additional products to further expand our aerospace infrastructure and testing capabilities. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth by focusing on our value over volume strategy in standard containers, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace all within EVA and return value to shareholders mindset. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace, while also continuing to return significant capital to shareholders following the board’s recent $50 million share repurchase authorization as well as achieving the 3.5 year plan we laid out in mid-2016 of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow of $2 billion and $1 billion respectively. Thanks to all of our employees who helped our company achieve these results as well as win numerous customer awards and recognitions including inclusion on the Dow Jones’ Sustainability Index and the recent humbling recognition of being ranked number one on Forbes Magazine’s List of America’s Best Employers for Diversity. All of this is possible because of our people and our culture. We’re proud of our 139 year history and we’ll continue to do what’s best for Ball and shareholders’ long-term success. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks John. Our global beverage business comparable operating earnings were up 3% year-over-year on full year global volume growth up 2%, offset somewhat by plant start-up costs, higher freight and the late year plant inefficiencies. Our global teams kept pace with notable growth in Europe, Russia and North America, which at times also created some operational and logistic inefficiencies given an oversold U.S. industry and strong demand in the UK, Nordics and Russia. We left some money on the table in 2018 and with new plants now 80% to 90% up their line curves that should flow through in 2019. Moving to the individual segments, Ball’s North American segment volumes were up 4% in the quarter. New categories led the way with wine, sparkling water, craft and spiked seltzers experiencing double-digit growth. And 2018 was truly a tale of two halves. Demand lagged in the U.S. during the first half as mass beer slowed, while in contrast, other customers struggle to properly gauge consumer demand for new product introductions during the busy summer selling season, ultimately leading to tight supply demand for specialty cans in the second half, leaving little room for air. At the same time, we were experiencing such growth; U.S. aluminum suppliers struggle to provide quality metal to us and this issue wasn’t resolved by year-end 2018, leading to plant network inefficiencies late in the year, resulting in our North American business producing lower than expected results despite strong volume growth. So far this year, the suppliers delivering metal we can run and our plant inefficiencies in the affected plants are improving. In order to ensure that this does not occur again, we have focused our efforts on ensuring that our metal suppliers doing the necessary things to deliver quality metal on time, exploring other metal options despite the aluminum tariff situation and by working with our customers to lay down safety stocks in this seasonally slower part of the year and ahead of what we anticipate will be a very strong year in North America. Given our customers’ current demand profiles, we anticipate selling 2 billion more units in 2019, while also reaping the net $50 million of fixed cost savings following the successful decommissioning of three plants and wrap up of our four line specialty point in Goodyear, Arizona. Turning to our South American segment, as expected, our Brazilian volumes were flat versus the industry being up 6% in the fourth quarter. Ball’s 2017 decision to forego some can business in Brazil and the completion of the INS manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction lead to lower fourth quarter and full year earnings. Looking forward, this second half 2018 trend will continue in first half of 2019 until we anniversary these items. Overall the South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories. Our expansions in Argentina, Paraguay and Chile are on track and we are excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America. With these expansions benefiting second half 2019, full year 2019 should be roughly in line with full year 2018 performance. European beverage earnings were up 29% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year. Volumes increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Cans are winning as customers shift their packaged mix away from plastics and into cans. Tailwinds such as this, the new facility in Spain coming on line successfully and the closure of our one line San Martino, Italy facility earlier than planned led to a strong finish in 2018. As we look forward, continued good market growth, the addition of two new lines in Switzerland and Serbia along with several other specialty line conversions scheduled to be brought on line in early 2019, the year-over-year impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and planned cost initiatives will provide further earnings growth and margin expansion in 2019. Turning to EMEA and Asia, the demand environments in Turkey, Egypt and India improved, but were offset by regional volatility and poor operating performance in our Saudi joint venture, which led to meaningfully lower volumes in the region and operating earnings down by more than $20 million year-over-year. And in China, the business remains cash flow positive and Ball continues to actively manage the business ahead -- excuse me, of its sale to ORG, which following regulatory approval should close in the second half of 2019. In summary, global beverage can demand remains robust in our three key regions of North America and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply demand for U.S. standard containers in certain specialty sizes is tight and commercial and sustainability initiatives will benefit Ball going forward. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I’ll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks Dan. Comparable full year and fourth quarter 2018 earnings were $2.20 and $0.55 respectively. Details are provided in the Notes section of today’s earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-K. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across our businesses, a lower effective tax rate than expected and slightly lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. food, steel food and aerosol business and lower year-over-year performance in North America and South America as Dan just outlined. From an overall cost perspective, our people have been doing a great job with our SG&A as a percentage of sales at an industry leading 4.1% for the full year. Also we mentioned on prior calls the timing of the U.S. steel food and aerosol sale versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares was slightly dilutive to earnings in the second half of 2018. Net debt ended the year at $6 billion and we anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as we continue to actively buyback stock and pay dividends throughout 2019. Close to 90% of Ball’s balance sheet debt is at fixed rates. And we’ve reached our post-Rexam target leverage levels with net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3 times as of year-end, leaving us well positioned in a rising interest rate environment. Our 2018 stock buyback exceeded $700 million and we paid approximately $140 million in dividends. In 2019, we expect to buyback $1 billion of stock and pay roughly a $135 million in dividends. As of yesterday, we have already acquired roughly a $100 million of stock in 2019. Looking forward and including 2018, our plan is to buyback approximately 18% of our outstanding shares by mid-2021 or approximately $1 billion of stock annually in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Once completed, we will have successfully repurchased the 75 million shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions. As we think about 2019, we continue to expect full year comparable EBITDA of $2 billion and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion after CapEx in the range of $600 million, full year interest expense of approximately $300 million and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 24% for all of 2019 and corporate undistributed should be roughly flat with 2018 levels. By investing in our businesses pursuing bolt-on M&A, repurchasing stock and paying quarterly dividends, we continue to put the cash machine to work for the long-term benefit of our fellow shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it back to you John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks Scott. In 2018 our aerospace business reported 21% revenue growth and 15% operating earnings growth on solid can performance, partially offset by the start-up and ramp up of many of these new contracts and new hires. As part of this, we welcomed 900 new aerospace employees, of which 42% were diverse hires. Given recent contract wins, we anticipate adding at least another 600 employees over the next 12 months. The entire management team has done a great work to ensure our new people are on-boarded, mentored and trained, our existing people feel part of this success, our facilities are fit and ready for the added throughput and our processes are redesigned and resilient enough for the higher standards expected, all while delivering on our financial commitments. Looking forward, aerospace is poised to grow earnings in the range of 15% in 2019 and with contracted backlog levels exceeding $2.2 billion and our won-not-booked backlog at $4.7 billion, the future looks bright for at least the next three to five years. As a corporation I truly believe we are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. We continue to manage our asset base with an aviated mindset. We are leading more efforts on our sustainability initiatives to ensure our aluminum packages are positioned as the environmental solution for our customers’ brand portfolios and we are supporting the rapid growth of our aerospace business. We’re controlling the things we can control, managing headwinds and leveraging our strong free cash flow to invest for the long-term and consistently return value to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. We continue to reaffirm our 2019 goals of $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. And in 2019, we look forward to exceeding our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal. And with that, Chris, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Yeah. I was wondering if it’s possible to quantify the impact of the supplier issue in North America for 4Q and maybe for 1Q if there is an early view there. And then you spoke about you know step you’re taking to kind of guarantee supply going forward with your suppliers. Do those initiatives -- is that -- does Ball incur costs as a part of those initiatives or just any kind of color you can give there would be helpful?
John Hayes: Sure. In the fourth quarter, as I said in my comments, in first quarter I don’t anticipate any ongoing inefficiencies, this was really marked by late October November. One supplier and it’s a toll relationship with the customer approximately $10 million of the impact is centered around that. Now we are in -- we’re in discussions with this particular supplier and the customer and hope to kind of reconcile that issue and the only issue there was we couldn’t get to the proper accounting treatment in the fourth quarter to recognize the offset.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I’d just add on to that. Those are the direct costs and there is many other indirect costs because it force freight rates to be higher because various plants were down as results of that. And so, that’s just the direct cost, but I think it probably had twice the -- double that was for the full impact what happens in the fourth quarter.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, okay. So it sounds like there is still an impact for out-of-pattern fright in 4Q. I guess same question for 1Q has that kind of dissipated or is there still a freight headwind in 1Q?
John Hayes: No, not ongoing in 1Q. And I guess to answer your other question, it’s we do have people that are certainly supporting the ongoing efforts there, but you’re talking about four to five folks and there’s no ongoing costs by us to help support that initiative.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, okay. That’s helpful. And then maybe just one quick one for Scott, I’m sorry if I missed this. But for the full year free cash flow guidance is there assumption on working capital embedded in there?
Scott Morrison: There’s not much. We’ve gotten tremendous benefits in the last couple of years. So there is not much benefit expected from working capital on those numbers for $1 billion of cash flow in 2019. It’s really the earnings growth, kind of tax effect the earnings growth and then a couple of hundred million dollars less in CapEx from this year to 2019 gets you to the $1 billion or over $1 billion.
Anthony Pettinari: Understood. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Staphos: Thank you. Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the details. I guess -- and congratulations for the year. I guess the first question I had is around growth. And so, in the last quarter we saw some interesting patterns in terms of can shipments and some of the end market data. One of things that we had heard recently is you’re seeing some pick up in beer consumption partly driven by the new labeling as consumers are starting to sort of look at beer versus alternatives. Are you hearing that or not really from your customers? And then relatively in terms of growth, there was a big pick up in can growth in the fourth quarter in non-alcoholic. It would seem that most of that was around the newer beverages categories that you have sighted, but how much of that is also, at least a part of it was, but -- and how much of that do you think is being driven more by sustainability and the shift out-of-plastic to can specifically within North America? And I have a couple of follow ons.
Daniel Fisher: Sure George. This is Dan. And I would say we didn’t see any -- in North America specifically in big beer versus craft beer versus the other beer categories, we didn’t see anything markedly different than can than what we’ve been seeing for the last several years. Craft beer continues to grow, cans continue to win share there. I would say the new alcoholic categories and the new non-alcoholic categories and product launches, those are disproportionately coming up in cans and that we’ve got IRI data and even Euromonitor data that would suggest that that’s a pretty sizeable shift from new product launches even 18 months, 24 months ago.
George Staphos: All right.
Daniel Fisher: We would believe that sustainability influenced. Our customers aren’t telling us that specifically, but everything would indicate. They’re launching new products in specialty can sizes. They’re garnering better price points. And I don’t know why we continue to build on in already huge issue for a couple of large CPG companies by launching new products and PET. So that’s our view is that is a sustainability move. I think it’s fairly significant, but we think that’s got a lot of tailwind for a longer period of time.
George Staphos: Okay. I mean it remains to be seen, but we’re hearing that even the megabeer guys are starting to see some pick-up in demand, we’ll see if it plays out actually or not. In terms of John…
John Hayes: Definitely in other parts of the world, we’re definitely seeing hectoliter expansion for the first in Russia, for the first time in Brazil. And I think they’re putting more dollars behind the promotional and advertising in big beer in North America tailwind to fourth quarter what we’ve seen to start the year, but whether that trend continues and for how long that will be something we’ll keep our eye on.
George Staphos: Okay. Thank you. John if you could repeat again what you were saying about your value over volume efforts, the commercial activity, the progress, I think that you’ve seen so far. I think you mentioned that some percentage, some large percentage of your contract renewals for the next 18 months are largely done. Can you go back over the details that you had in your formal comments and what implications we should be drawing from that to the extent that you can related to our own forecasting entries, forecasting of all results?
John Hayes: Yeah. George as I said, I think I’ll be repeating myself, but the vast majority of our contracts to come due in North America over the next 18 months are largely concluded. And we signed the agreement not necessarily, but we’ve reached commercial agreement and now we’re getting to the documentation thereof. As you know, many of those kind of kick in at the end of 2019 going into 2020 and that’s why I said the majority of the value of that will come after 2019.
George Staphos: Fair enough. Let me leave it there and I’ll turn it over to the rest of the queue. Thank you.
John Hayes: Thank you, George.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks. Good morning. 
John Hayes: Good morning.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Scott Gaffner: I think you said before that your freight transportation costs in the U.S. had flattened out, but when we look at the recovery from 2018 you had fairly significant headwinds on freight costs. Are you able to recover meaningful amounts of that in 2019 based on the current faster mechanisms you have or do you have to wait more until 2019 when you get contract reset?
Scott Morrison: No. Scott, this is Scott Morrison. We have PPI escalators in our contracts specifically in North America that will -- there’s a catch up to it so we’ll catch up with the PPI escalation and we’re seeing moderation of those other headwinds.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. Dan when you mentioned some weakness in Saudi Arabia, I mean I think you said Turkey, Egypt, India all improved, but Saudi was still weak. Is that a new trend or is that just a continuation of the sugar taxes that were put in place or soda taxes that were put in place in Saudi Arabia over the last year or so?
Daniel Fisher: Just, yeah just a continuation of the sugar tax degradation in that area. Everyone else is -- and it’s -- we feel like it’s stabilized in Q4 and starting off on a piece of foot, but just a stabilized environment. We’re not going to see any appreciable uplift in that country or a JV relationship there for a period of time.
John Hayes: Yeah. And Scott, this is John. I’d just -- financially I’d just point out, you can clearly see that in the equity line where that -- you’ll see the negative impact of that. And Dan can provide you more details.
Scott Gaffner: All right. Last one for me just in the prepared remarks you mentioned 2 billion units of volume growth in North America. Can you remind us what the 2018 number of units in North America were? And then on that volume growth, should we assume that most of that is actually coming in specialty versus 12 ounce? Thanks.
John Hayes: Yeah. I think it will continue to be a similar composition from a specialty standard can, probably a little richer on the specialty is those are the new lines that we put in place. We were kind of mid-to-$46 billion approximately in terms of unit volumes sold. So you put two on top of that in North -- Central America.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Matthew Krueger: Hey, good morning. This is actually Matthew Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
John Hayes: Good.
Daniel Fisher: Good. Thanks.
Matthew Krueger: Good, good. So my first question is can you provide a bridge from the $1.83 billion in EBITDA generated during 2018 to the projected $2 billion for 2019 just in terms of any major puts and takes like volume contribution or cost savings initiatives, et cetera, et cetera? 
John Hayes: Sure, let me take a shot of that. So if you think about aerospace, given their growth, we expect them to be up $30 plus million in EBITDA. So you’re starting at $1.830 billion so that’s 30. North America and Central America, we talked about $50 million of fixed cost savings on a full year basis, 2 billion more units of volume with better mix and the rest is the PPI pick-up that I mentioned earlier and moderation of headwinds. All that toll should be something in the neighborhood of a $125 million on a full year basis. Europe, we’ve been able to --they’ve done a great job of improving their margins year-on-year. We’ll get probably another $40 million of growth in EBITDA from both cost out and volume growth. South America is probably pretty flat and then EMEA and Asia up a little bit. So kind of a slight positive when you combine those together. And then aluminum aerosol or probably can and a little bit of upside in corporate costs. And then you have the absence of the tinplate business for seven months. So all that tolls to a little bit over $2 billion.
Matthew Krueger: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then just expanding a little bit on the cost savings programs, how should we expect the $50 million in cost savings to flow through the North America business kind of on a quarterly cadence? And then can you detail on any of the other cost savings initiatives that we should expect to impact 2019 region-by-region in a similar fashion?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. I would say in North America, all of the facilities are shuttered and our Goodyear facility is probably closer to 90% through the start-up phase. So absent any kind of marginal cost impact in Q1 as the continued ramp up for our Goodyear facility, you should see that almost on an annualized basis streamline throughout the year, the $50 million.
John Hayes: And then maybe a qualitatively on the other cost initiatives if we go through Europe as Scott and Dan had mentioned, Europe has done a very good job from a cost out within the plant perspective. We have the San Martino that came down towards the end of the year. And we also have a lot of transformation from a G&A perspective. And as Scott alluded to, we’ve done a very nice job overall as a corporation on the G&A and particularly in Europe, so kudos to all of them. I think in South America, we are lapping as Dan said, some headwinds in terms of the INS contract, as well as foregoing some of the business that we were benefiting in the first quarter and even first half of last year, but they’ve done a great job on the cost side. And I think we’re going to have some headwinds year-over-year in the first half of this year, but you’re going to see it reverse in the second half of the year. So I think that’s going well. We talked about EMEA and the issues going on there and there’s a lot of effort and focus and working with our joint venture partner Saudi to right size that business and really participate in the growth of Turkey, Egypt and other places like he said. And then lastly in North America, Scott mentioned -- Scott and Dan mentioned the $50 million. We also have been putting a lot of effort on making sure that from an efficient supply demand point of view that we’re minimizing any of that out-of-pattern freight that we experienced last year.
Matthew Krueger: Great. That’s very helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Neel Kumar: Hi, good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Neel Kumar: I was wondering if could you talk about what plants in particular were impacted by the aluminum issue and you still generated 4% volume growth in North America despite the downtime at the affected plants. So how are you able to increase production at your other plants given that they were likely already running at capacity from the oversold industry?
Daniel Fisher: Well we, number one to answer your question, we drew down inventories to do that. We’re not going to go into specifics of what plants were affected, that’s not what we do, but recall that we only have a limited number of metal suppliers. And so, any given -- a metal supplier probably serves multiple plants and you should think about it that way.
Neel Kumar: Okay. That’s helpful. And then in terms of the commercial opportunity you’ve talked in the past about some contract renegotiations in Europe in 2019. Could you give an estimate of what percent of contracts could be up for renegotiation there?
John Hayes: Well, we -- I'm sorry. What year, at the end of 2019, did you say?
Neel Kumar: For the end of 2018 and 2019?
John Hayes: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, approximately a quarter or so of our European volume was renegotiated and we’re pleased with where we are right now.
Neel Kumar: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on European volumes and I guess up 8% this year. Could you just talk a little bit about I guess what was Russia and what was Europe and then just kind of thoughts for this year, as you know it’s tough comps, but I guess you’re still seeing good growth and benefiting from substitution, so just some color there would be great?
Daniel Fisher: Sure. In Russia as you recall had the World Cup and strong summer and benefited from actually some legislative actions in Russia moving away from some larger PET. And so, they grew at approximately 20% for the year. In Central and Eastern Europe we had one customer, large customer that grew nearly 10% that we have a sole supply relationship with. And then we stepped into the new Cabanillas facility, we stepped into a new contract. So in the second half of the year you saw Iberia grow year-over-year north of 10%. That was contractual volume. But you saw solid growth low-to-mid single-digits in the Nordics in the UK and other parts, but the three large areas that really drove our volume were Iberia, Central and Eastern Europe and Russia.
John Hayes: Yeah. Just to add on to that and it gets to an earlier question about the whole sustainability. You know some of the bigger -- what’s perceived is more mature markets. Just to give you context and I think about the UK, I think of France, I think of Germany. In the fourth quarter alone the UK was up 7%, France was up 7.5% and Germany was up around 20% so that is on relatively flat overall liquid consumption. So I think that strength does reinforce our belief around this whole sustainability movement.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Thanks. And then Scott, could you just update us sort of the shared services savings I don’t know if there was sort of lump in sort of the segments when you provided the sort of the EBITDA bridge before, but just what you’re expecting there?
Scott Morrison: That’s really kind of spread everywhere. So there’s some of it shows up in corporate, but some of it shows up in the business. So we don’t really break it down that way, but that’s part of the improvement across the board. When you look at the operations as John mentioned, the cost out that they’ve done in South America and Europe and in North America as well. So it’s kind of spread across the board.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Right. Thanks for taking the question. You know you guys had talked about kind of 2% to 4% bevcan volume growth over the next little while; obviously there were some issues in Q4 related to metal. But how do you feel about that forecast, any potential upside or downside given some trends in non-12 ounce and maybe you can just give us your view and also tie that in with your regional expectations? Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. It’s a great question. I would say my lean would be based on what we saw in the second half of the year, what we saw in Q4 particularly and in conversations with our customers and anticipated forecast going into next year and even through our strap pulling period. There would be reason to believe that we could grow at an accelerated cliff above what we’ve -- kind of historical norm would have been. So, and I think a lot of that is just probability affecting and assessing the impact of sustainability and how fast that will move. That’s the biggest question mark, but we’re certainly excited about it and believe we’ve got more tailwind there than anything else.
John Hayes: Yeah. As Dan had mentioned, just the full year our global volumes were up a little over 2%, but in the fourth quarter they were up 4%. So I think that’s a good proof point in terms of the momentum we’re seeing.
Arun Viswanathan: Appreciate that. And just as a follow up, in Brazil, have you noticed any changes in the market? Have things gotten better or worse and any thoughts around political shifting that would affect that? Thanks.
Daniel Fisher: We’ve been actually reasonably encouraged by the political shift. We know that -- and from an overall market, you have the new entrant, but with the growth rates that are there and I think John’s commented on this historically, it doesn’t take much growth outside a 4%, 5% and the markets start absorbing all the excess capacity that was introduced. So we think heading into 2019 and the plan period here that market is definitely tightening and there is reason to believe that there is margin expansion opportunities going forward.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Maguire: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Brian Maguire: I just wanted to come back to the comments around the $2 billion can production growth in North America in 2019. Just wondering if you could give a sense of how much of that is just replenishing the inventories you drew down in the quarter due to the aluminum sheet issue. I ask because it seems like the end markets probably aren’t growing that much even with the upsurge we saw in the fourth quarter can shipments in the U.S. were up less than a million this year. So just wondering if that comment is indicative of you guys expecting to take a little bit of market share here in 2019 or are you expecting the market growth rate to kind of meaningfully pick up from where it has been the last couple of years?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah, I would -- good question. I would look at it as -- keep in mind in 2018 we shut our three facilities, we stood up new four line can plant; we added some additional specialty capacity in Conroe all with an eye towards contracting that volume which we have done historically. So there is a piece of this where we’re stepping into increased specialty volume. It’s been contracted; there is good line of sight there. We do think the market is going to grow at an accelerated rate in North America versus what we saw in 2018 largely on the basis of the second half movements and new product introductions. The 2018 versus 2019 for us, we will grow at an accelerated rate versus the market. But again, those are contracted volumes that were initialized by our footprint.
John Hayes: Yeah. And I’d just layer on top of that. Remember over the last some years we’ve put an extremely large focus on specialty. And we can go West Coast to East Coast, North to South and we have a network and footprint that we think is better than any of our peers. And as a result of that, as these new product introductions and the shift from standard containers to specialty, it falls right in the sweet spot of what we’ve been focused on.
Brian Maguire: Okay. I appreciate that. Just as a follow up, this one might be a little bit of an accounting one. But Dan, I think you mentioned the $10 million impact in the fourth quarter from the aluminum issue that there was a toll in customer and there was just some of the accounting didn’t let you recognize maybe offsetting compensation in the quarter. So do you get $10 million back in 2019, is there some kind of pass through or compensation from the customer here?
Daniel Fisher: We have to wait until we resolve the issue and then we’ll let you know.
Brian Maguire: Okay. But anything embedded in the 2019 outlook or the $50 million kind of comment of fixed cost saving, I guess that will be separate, but just anything embedded in the 2019 outlook for that?
Daniel Fisher: No.
Brian Maguire: No? Okay. I appreciate that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Debbie Jones: Hi. Good morning. I’m going to be the another person asking on the $2 billion can number you threw out there. But could you comment on -- is this really being driven on the specialty side by a couple of customers shifting into specialty or using it or are you seeing this is very broad-based? And then also how much of the growth in 4Q and the number that you’re throwing out for 2019 do you think is related to the sustainability efforts of some to your customers?
Daniel Fisher: Just to parse out the sustainability one, but if we’re -- it could be 1% to 2% of growth in specific markets where this is a bigger issue and it’s more broad, it’s in Western Europe, it’s in the UK and it’s starting to manifest in the U.S. The other question was on specialty and I would just -- Debbie I would reference the fact that in North America we have 800 customers. So it’s across the entire breadth of those customers, it’s not a singular focus of one or two, it’s everyone’s moving.
John Hayes: Yeah. And as -- in the fourth quarter our specialty was up 13% in North America. And when you look it’s everything Dan just said, it was traditional CST, it was spiked seltzer, it was beer, it was energy, it was all new categories, emerging wine, seltzer waters et cetera. So it truly is broad-based.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Thank you. And second question, there has been an announcement of a new can plant in the Europe, I think in Belgium with the new entrant and we’ve received a lot of questions about it. So I wanted to just see if you had any thoughts on it. I do think that the European industry is growing enough to absorb this, but I think investors are a little confused as how to think about it and how it might impact some of the larger players there?
John Hayes: Yeah. Well, I might point out a couple of things. The overall can industry in Europe grew by in the range of 4 billion units or so in 2018. It’s our best understanding that this new entrant is a small one line facility in the Benelux region focused on one customer that’s going to be using standard containers. So you have to put this in context. I do think as we look forward, we’ve -- as Dan had mentioned, we have some new capacity, obviously Spain coming up, but we’ve put some new lines in Serbia as well as Switzerland. And so we’ve been growing. And so we fully anticipate other people that are going to be investing to meet the demands of the market.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Thanks. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please go ahead.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Edlain Rodriguez: Just one quick one. I mean you seemed pretty confident in achieving your targets for 2019, but when you look at everything that’s going on, like what do you see like the most risk in achieving those targets?
John Hayes: Well, I mean this is John Hayes. Maybe I’ll take this. I think a lot of what Scott Morrison laid out in the bridge is in our control. Obviously we had some metal issues in late 2018; we’re out of our control. We have been very focused on making sure number one the situation getting better; number two, we have sufficient supply; and number three, we’re working on other alternatives longer term so that we have a plan B if something like that were to happen. Obviously this whole sustainability provides big tailwind for us, but if for some reason there is a big dislocation in the demand side of our business around the global that could have an impact. But I will point to the financial crisis of 2008 when our volumes in the worst quarter were down 4%. So we don’t expect that to happen. I think really the biggest risk to us is our ability or inability to execute on what we have in front of us right now.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. That makes sense. That’s all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris -- excuse me, Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Chip Dillon: Yes. Good morning, everyone. I thought I’d be the first one perhaps to ask the question about what your, one of your fastest growing businesses which is aerospace. And you mentioned some pretty large growth initiatives there including the employee growth and I believe you said the income growth of 15% 20 versus 2018. However, it looks like looking at your backlog that we could see either several years of that kind of growth or maybe it could even accelerate in 2020 and 2021. And so, obviously not knowing everything, but just given your current line of sight, what kind of progress do you think we will see in 2020 and 2021 especially given the 30% plus increase in the employee base?
Daniel Fisher: I think the logic you just laid out is sound and we would agree with that with one caveat. Our government, we rely on our government to be operating efficiently and funded effectively and we just have come out of the longest of furlough in the history of the U.S. government there is potentially that going forward. It has not affected us to date, but strategically when you’re running the deficits that we are, something is going to give. That’s why we talk about both funded backlog which is money good and then won-not-booked. And as we said repeatedly over the last six or nine months the won-not-booked we feel good about, but there is some risk to that going forward and that affects the 2020, 2021, 2022 timeframe. And so as we sit here today, the thing I would be focused on the most is about that because the rest of it’s in our control.
Chip Dillon: Got you. Okay. That’s very helpful. And then just quickly, as -- you guys give us great data for example on volumes and periodically you tell us your mix with specialty versus standard. It just seems with especially the categories that are growing that you’re seeing so much more growth now in the specialty area. And I didn’t know like for example, if we took this the 2% companywide growth last year, is it fair to say standard or down, I don’t know mid-single-digits and specialty waiver took that? And just so that we get a better view or sense of what the mix is doing?
John Hayes: Yeah. Chip, I’ll tell you this, our specialty globally grew for the year at around 9% and it’s approximately 39% or 40% of our mix. So when you do the math you can see standard had declined. And that’s why, to Dan’s point, we took out three facilities in North America in 2018. That’s why we closed the San Martino, Italy plant which was a standard container. So we’ve been managing this mixed shift as we go forward. And that’s why we’ve been investing on all these specialty lines.
Chip Dillon: Okay. And last one quickly, as you look out past 2019, you’re giving -- CapEx is coming down, you’ve listed a lot of growth opportunities you wanted to jump on top of. Again, based on your line of sight, is 600 something we would -- you would -- would be a good best guess for 2020 or are there reasons it could go up or down from what you see today?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Chip, I would use 600, I think it’s a good proxy. We really -- there is a lot of growth in there, it’s probably up $50 million from where we were six months ago in terms of accelerating things and kind of bringing them to the left to take advantage of some of this growth. I would use that as a decent proxy, but if the sustainability thing really takes off, we could spend more money, but we’re going to do it just like we’ve always done with the mindset of putting capital to work where we’re getting the right returns.
Chip Dillon: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Good morning. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Dan just a couple of questions on the sustainability topic again, I think Brian was asking about your outlook for the U.S. market, it was up 0.6% last year and you’re expecting that to accelerate and you saw the acceleration, particularly in the fourth quarter. Do you tie that directly to this sustainability move that you’re talking about? Is there any other reason why you think shipments meaningfully accelerated in the fourth quarter and that you’re expecting them to accelerate in 2019 versus 2018?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. It’s a good question. I don’t think I have the answer, but my thesis would be it’s largely because of sustainability. I mean we know that the large CPG players in particular, they don’t have a very attractive mix shift. I mean some of their CEOs were getting beat up pretty good over in Davos a week ago. And the one thing we can point to, Adam, I just keep coming back to new product launches. We’re seeing much more activity in and around innovation from a can perspective and we’re dealing with the marketing groups in the large CPG companies and we are attributing it to in North American, Western Europe, UK, the Nordics to sustainability being a fairly significant driver of that.
John Hayes: Yeah. Just one little proof point, this is on more the alcohol side, but craft beer is our best estimation that for the first time ever cans as a share of the packaged mix is now over 40% in the craft market. Our volumes in craft are still up well in excess of 30% despite overall volume of craft, meaning liquid volume up only about 1%. So that sustainability, we can’t point to any specific fact to tell you that’s the case, but I do think that there is a consumer trend out there that’s much more focused on us.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. And Dan just on Europe, I think you said volume was up 8% for the year if I’m not mistaken and forgive me for missing this. Did you give any expectation for 2019 in terms of European volume? And again, how much of that -- how much of whatever growth you’re expecting would you attribute to that same sustainability movement?
Daniel Fisher: I would think it’s going to be a little off that. I mean keep in mind it was unprecedented weather conditions and a lot of big beer drinking jurisdictions, but you know I could see mid-single digits. And again, I think where we play and where our network is we may grow at a faster rate than the overall market just because of our customer mix, Russia continues to be incredibly strong, we’ll lap our Iberian new contracts and the standup of Cabanillas. But I’d say market -- you know 4% to 5% we could do better. That’s certainly our plan and our hope.
Adam Josephson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Deanna Stottler with Ball Corporation. Please go ahead. Looks like line has disconnected.
Daniel Fisher: Chris, unless there is any other questions I’d recommend we conclude.
Operator: Okay. We do have one more question in the queue from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. 
Mark Wilde: Good morning, John. Good morning, Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: Just curious to come back to Europe, how much capacity do you have or how much could you grow in 2019 just given your capacity base?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. It’s a good question. We have, as indicated in the prepared comments, we have added a couple of lines one in Serbia that just came on line actually last week, I was over there earlier this week. Another line in Central and Eastern Europe that one is ready to go, we haven’t flipped the switch on. And then ramp up curves in basically in Spain stepping into improved efficiencies there and approved efficiencies across the rest of the jurisdiction.  But we’re certainly tight; we’ve got a couple of pockets of opportunity to continue to grow. But keep in mind, historically we’ve always got speed up opportunities, we’ve got a laundry list of areas where we can spend minimal capital. And we’ve waited for this tailwind and it’s here now. And so we’re not going to miss out on volume opportunities at the right price.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And Dan I’m just curious over in Europe in terms of bottled waters or whatever picking up. I know that you’ve got a lot of people that are interested in looking at the format, but I wonder whether capacity constraints right now make it hard for some of those customers to make a large move. So what kind of conversations are you having, and is there a potential that we could see one or two very large moves over there at some point or do you think it will be just more kind of incremental?
Daniel Fisher: There will absolutely -- yeah, there will absolutely be the opportunity for large moves. The constraint is not necessarily on our end, it would be some of those major customers making filling investments in their infrastructure. So we wouldn’t be the deterrent for those moves. I mean we’re in front of a number of them right now as they’re contemplating shifts. There is an off a lot happening from independent start-ups that are driving that inertia from some of the big CPG players. I do think that that is something that we’re having conversations on, something that we believe will happen. It will probably start at the high end of the water market, but you know depending on what legislation hits and single use water bans that are popping up that conversations happening everywhere now, something will be a catalyst for a major move and we will have enough time hopefully to move into that in a meaningful and a smart way.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then if I could, Scott, you mentioned the PPI escalators. I’m just curious, PPI I think kind of has been moving up maybe 3%, 3% plus, but you might had a much bigger move in freight cost. So will the PPI really catch you up for freight this year fully?
Scott Morrison: Good morning, Mark. It probably won’t offset the -- if you look back -- kind of probably what timeframe you’re looking back, but if you look back at our incremental freight cost all of 2018, the PPI will offset a large portion of that, but not all.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks very much. Good luck in 2019.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Daniel Fisher: Okay.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 1, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, Melody, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our CFO, and Dan Fisher, our Senior Vice President and our COO of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with some comments on our aerospace business as well as the outlook for our company. Let me begin by thanking those of you who came to our Investor Field Trip earlier in October. It was great spending time with many of you and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us articulate how and why Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in its global beverage can aluminum aerosol container and aerospace businesses, consistently return significant capital back to our shareholders and grow our diluted earnings per share 10% to 15% over time. For those of you who were unable to attend the field trip, the slides and transcript of the webcast briefing are available on our Investor page at ball.com under the Presentations tab. Now turning to third quarter results, momentum continues across our businesses. On an apples-to-apples basis, comparable operating earnings were up 14% year-over-year, excluding the sale of the U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses completed on July 31. This was despite a few headwinds that we'll get into in a moment. In addition, a higher-than-expected effective tax rate driven by currency movements, which Scott will go into in a few minutes, also impacted us. We continue to execute our strategies of achieving better value for our standard products and higher growth for our specialty products, pursuing cost-out programs, completing growth capital projects to fuel future earnings growth, and commercializing on the inherent sustainability attributes of metal packaging to provide our customers solutions versus other substrates. In addition, we've put $600 million of proceeds from the food and aerosol sale to good work, acquiring stock and paying down debt, allowing us to reach our targeted leverage levels ahead of schedule. Now moving on to segment results in the quarter, volumes in our North and Central American beverage can business were up year-over-year, driven by emerging beverage categories as well as double-digit specialty can growth, which Dan Fisher will elaborate on more. In addition, we continued to execute on our long-stated need to secure more value for the supply of our standard products. Offsetting some of this tailwind, we continue to incur out-of-pattern freight and start-up costs related to the final two lines getting up to speed in the new Goodyear, Arizona facility. Our plant optimizations in Chatsworth, California and Longview, Texas are complete with both facilities closing this past quarter. Our South American business delivered solid performance, despite the previously-disclosed transition away from ends contract and loss of certain can volumes in Brazil. This will be more pronounced during the seasonally-strong fourth quarter and normalize as we move into 2019. Our European business continues to sequentially improve on its performance through cost-out and volume growth. We completed the start-up of our new plant in Cabanillas, Spain and we announced the intention to close a one-line facility in San Martino, Italy and expand our specialty capabilities in our Nogara, Italy beverage can plant in the North. While we still have more work to do, we are seeing the margin expansion opportunity in this segment that we articulated upon the completion of the acquisition in mid-2016. In the aluminum aerosol side of our business, global volumes were up over 7% in the quarter and this business continues to operate quite well. Our aerospace business continues to add to its record-high backlog, winning additional contracts throughout the quarter and even since our October Investor Field Trip. And lastly, we continue to focus on our G&A costs, which have continued to trend down as a percent of sales and now currently stand at 4% of revenues. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, by focusing on our value-over-volume strategy, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace, all with an EVA and return of value to shareholders' mindset. While we're dealing with a few short-term factors outside of our control, including higher freight rates and tight metal supply in the U.S. and a more volatile global economy and foreign exchange environment overall, Ball's businesses are uniquely positioned for consistent long-term growth and strong free cash flow in 2019 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Our Global Beverage business operating earnings were up 11% year-to-date. As John mentioned, our global teams kept up with strong demand for beverage cans across Europe, Russia and North America, a welcome improvement but one that created incremental freight costs above plan, given Ball's support of an oversold U.S. industry, while we completed the planned closures of Chatsworth, California and Longview, Texas, and the ongoing ramp-up of the next two lines in our Goodyear, Arizona facility. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North America segment volumes rebounded, up just over 2% in the quarter and profits were up notably, given the lack of hurricane disruption versus third quarter 2017. New categories led the way with wine, sparkling water, craft and spiked seltzers experiencing double-digit growth. Our North America team dealt with an incredible amount of capital projects, plant rationalizations, specialty can growth and freight cost growth through the first nine months of the year. Everyone is looking forward to having the planned operations network move out of project mode, and ultimately, benefit from fixed cost savings and reduced start-up costs in late 2018 and beyond. Embracing complexity is what we signed up for. It is where the growth is and even more economic value. We also are experiencing some short-term supply dislocation from certain metal suppliers that we expect to manage through during the fourth quarter and which should alleviate by year-end. Turning to our South American segment. As expected, our volumes were down 3% in the quarter due to Ball's 2017 decision to forgo some can business in Brazil. During the quarter, we also completed the ends manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction. Both of these actions have been discussed since mid-2017. So the business performing only $7 million lower in the quarter versus 2017 was an accomplishment. South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories. FX volatility across the region impacted the effective tax rate in the quarter, but did not impact the industry demand trends or segment profitability. Our expansions in Argentina, Paraguay and Chile are on track and we're excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America. In short, our business is being very effectively managed and is well positioned for 2019 and beyond. European beverage earnings were up 14% year-over-year on double-digit volume growth. Europe is ground zero for the war on plastics and we are beginning to see customers alter their package mix away from plastics and into cans. The near-term capturable opportunity we discussed during our Investor Field Trip is happening. Tailwinds such as this, the second line ramping up in Spain and the completion of G&A transformation projects will provide additional earnings growth in 2019. The demand environments in Turkey and India are stable, but were largely offset by anticipated demand volatility across the remainder of our Middle Eastern business. And in China, the business remains cash flow-positive and Ball continues to execute its disciplined approach in this country. In summary, while we continue to deal with a couple of lingering headwinds, the heavy lifting on several of our large global projects is behind us. Supply-demand for U.S. standard containers and certain specialty sizes is quite tight, and we are experiencing progress on commercial initiatives and commercializing sustainability which will benefit 2020 and beyond. Thank you, again, to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2018 earnings were $0.56 versus $0.52 in 2017. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across our businesses and lower corporate costs, offset by the sale of our steel food and aerosol business at a higher effective tax rate, the effect of which was $0.05 year-over-year. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was largely related to foreign exchange gains for tax purposes. This relates to managing our balance sheet in various regions. For 2018 key metrics, we expect CapEx in excess of 700 million, free cash flow in the range of $800 million, full-year 2018 interest expense around $300 million. The full-year effective tax rate will increase to 25% based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform and currency movements. And corporate undistributed is now expected to be in the range of $100 million for the full-year 2018. We put the July 31 cash proceeds from the food and aerosol sale to good work, acquiring stock and further reducing debt. Given the timing of the sale versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares, it will continue to be slightly dilutive to earnings in the fourth quarter. Prospectively, on a full-year basis, the transaction will be neutral to slightly positive related to diluted earnings per share, due to the incremental share repurchase, and positive to EVA dollar generation in 2019. Net debt ended the quarter at $6.1 billion and we anticipate year-end net debt closer to $6 billion, as we continued to actively buy back stock during the fourth quarter. Roughly 86% of Ball's balance sheet debt is at fixed rates and we've reached our post-Rexam target leverage level ahead of schedule with net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.2 times as of quarter-end, leaving us well-positioned in a rising interest rate environment. The cash flow continues to be strong and year-to-date through yesterday we've repurchased a net $525 million worth of stock or 13.8 million shares. By year-end, we expect our stock buyback to exceed $700 million, in addition to paying approximately $140 million in dividends. Looking forward, over the next three years, our plan is to buy back approximately 18% of our outstanding shares by 2021 or approximately $1 billion of stock annually in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Once completed, we'll have successfully repurchased the 75 million shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions. In addition to investing in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on M&A and paying quarterly dividends, that's truly putting the cash machine to work for the long-term benefit of our fellow shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported higher revenues and operating earnings, driven by solid contract performance, partially offset by incremental labor costs and the lower accruals related to the start-up of many of these new contracts. We continue to expect aerospace will produce material operating earnings improvement in the fourth quarter as new contracts ramp up. Year-to-date, we have hired approximately 800 new aerospace employees and anticipate adding another 200 to 400 employees over the next 12 months following recent contract wins. The team has done an excellent job managing this rapid growth. With contracted backlog levels at a record $2 billion and our won-not-booked backlog now exceeding $5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion since our second quarter call, the future looks even brighter for aerospace over the next three to five years. As a corporation, we truly are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. We continue to manage our asset base with an EVA mindset approach. We are leading more efforts on our sustainability initiatives to ensure aluminum packages for beverage and aerosol are properly positioned as the environmental solution for our customers' brand portfolios, and we're supporting the rapid growth of our aerospace business. We're controlling the things we can control, managing headwinds and leveraging our strong free cash flow to invest for the long-term and consistently return value to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. We continue to reaffirm our 2019 goals of $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. And in 2019 and beyond, we are positioned to grow diluted earnings per share 10% to 15% over time. And with that, let's move on to the Q&A. Melody, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: A quick question on Europe. I mean, volume, nice pick up, 10%. Like, how sustainable is that? Like, where can growth be in 2019-2020 as you're seeing some shift into cans from other substrate?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, that's a great question. I think 10% had all of us very excited. That was unanticipated heading into the quarter. But mid-single digit growth, given our footprint in Russia and also the sustainability lift, we're having conversations with customers today and we think that that is a very real tailwind. Relative to what we would expect on the PET shift specifically, it is still going to require investment both from our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we can capture all of it and with the speed. But I think this is a short-term, mid-term, and a 10-year journey that we will continue to benefit from.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And just one quick follow-up on Brazil, especially like on FX. Most of your competitors seem to be having FX issues over there in the P&L. Like, how come we're not seeing those headwinds hitting your P&L?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Our business is really a dollar-based business pass-through and then we hedge our net working capital position because we have our dollar functional entity down there. So, that's why the tax rate was actually higher because we hedged the balance sheet. And when you get a lot of volatility in a currency in a short period of time, we're going to have gains that are taxable and that's why our tax rate actually was a little bit higher. But actual transactional FX is not a big deal to us typically.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all of the commentary and detail. I wanted to dig a little bit into North and Central America and how the performance trended versus your expectations, particularly is there a way for you to parse for us what the start-up out-of-pattern freight, et cetera, inefficiencies were, given your footprint initiatives and given the volume trends that you saw?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. George, this is John. Why don't I quickly start? I know freight. Let's just focus on that. On a net freight basis, net of what we passed through our customers, we had a $15 million headwind year-over-year in the quarter on that alone. So, just to give you a magnitude of that. The startup, as you know, we had started up the Goodyear facility in the second quarter. So we had a little bit of tailwind. Off the top of my head, I don't know exact, but it was a few million dollars. But I think the biggest part of it was the freight.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I'm sorry, you're saying that was a tailwind or that was a continued inefficiency in the third quarter on the start of it?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, continued inefficiency.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And George, one data point on that, the market was flattish and we were up 3%. Some of that was the backstop of supply disruption from some of our competitors. And so those unanticipated volumes also built on that.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That makes sense. That makes sense. Second question I had, I know it's a little early to talk about 2019, but I was curious if you could help us a little bit with how the segments should ultimately build out into that $2 billion EBITDA goal and where we should see the most movement. As we sit here today, I think your LTM comparable EBITDA is about $1.890 billion. There's probably little bit of a tail-off when we get to the fourth quarter because last year you had such a strong performance in Latin America. So, that $150 million or so, whatever the right number is, how should we see that fill out the various segments pro rata? And is Latin America down next year, based on some of the comments you're making? Or did I misread that? Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over from that.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: George, this is John. Why don't I kind of start and let's first talk about aerospace. We have meaningful growth in aerospace. And so we've told the world we're going to make in excess of $105 million, $110 million, in that range kind of this year, and we expect 15% growth on that. So there's call it, round numbers, $15 million right there. I think as you go into the aluminum aerosol side, we continue to see growth. Now that's not huge, but we're talking call it $10 million. So that's $25 million. And then when you get in the beverage can business, just the footprint in North America alone, all things being equal, we've said is $50 million...
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: ...which Dan also mentioned. And we expect to get further growth in North America, particularly on the specialty sides, and margin up in that business. And so we're going to see some improvement in North America related to that. And, as we've talked about, we're actively managing the freight situation. So we should be able to eliminate any negativity there. And if we can get some tailwinds around that, that would be a plus. Then you go over to Europe and we're closing our San Martino plant. We really haven't gotten any of the benefit from the Cabanillas, Spain start-up. We've got the sustainability that Dan talked about. And we also have the G&A that Dan talked about, in addition to the continued growth. So, that's a big chunk of it. To answer your question specifically in South America, we expect year-over-year growth in South America. It's going to be a bit muted because of this ends contract that we're losing this year. So, remember, we had it for the first half of this year or even a little bit longer than that and we won't have it. But we do expect kind of flat to improved growth there. And then, in other places, corporate and the others, that's the bridge effectively.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Congrats on the strong performance. I just wanted to go back to overall beverage can volumes tracking about 3% in the quarter, a very strong result in Europe. It looks like the industry is doing a good job of offsetting megabeer weakness with mix shift elsewhere and in growth elsewhere. I guess is that a fair characterization? And as you look out over the next year or two, do you expect kind of overall global bev can growth to be in that low-single-digit range from here on and what are the differences between regions? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I'd say, first things first, big beer in North America, we have that at kind of down 1% in the quarter. So, not all that significant. Obviously, Mexican import is kind of built into that number that helps to offset that. So, as long as that trend with folks like Constellation and Heineken shipping in products continue to grow, and we participate obviously heavily with those customers, then that helps to offset the declines. And as we've said multiple times on the call, the big beer for one of our customers that's vertically integrated is largely contained into their system as opposed to ours and our competitors. We've kind of earmarked, as we're heading into kind of our strat plan season, 2% to 4% growth globally for the beverage can. The one area that's most exciting though to us and it's hard for us really to calculate is the potential share shift substrate penetration in Europe and in North America. So, over the medium- to long-term, we're bullish in those two regions in particular with the potential for can to PET shift. And then, in South America, Brazil and Argentina and even Chile were incredibly strong here in the last 12 months to 18 months. I suspect that will modulate a bit and get back to kind of historical norms. Southeast Asia will continue to be strong. China will be flattish to slightly up but, obviously, we'll take a discretionary approach in terms of capital investment to pursue that. But, overall, I think the tailwinds of plastic are going to be a benefit to us going forward and I think this 2% to 4% growth range is something that we're fairly confident in and we're certainly putting plans in and around that.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. Appreciate all the detail on George's question. So, I guess, just curious if your discussion around commercial opportunities in North America is built into those assumptions? You called out, say, $50 million from footprint and some growth above that. Is there a possibility for potential upside there due to the commercial opportunities or is that embedded in there?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No. I think you should expect beyond 2019 is when you'd see any of the commercial activities in our North American business. And we talked about that in our October Investor Day.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Morning.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): A couple of questions on North America. Your volumes were up 2%. I was wondering if it's possible to parse that out between U.S. versus Mexico. And then, you specified metal supply dislocations that you expect to normalize. Just what's driving that and was there a real impact to earnings in 3Q?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: No. And I'll take the metal question. This is one mill in North America and we've had our team meeting on a pretty regular basis since kind of third week of September with the team there to kind of work through the production issues that they've been facing. As it stands today based on everything I know, we'll be able to manage through this and have a clean slate heading into 2019. Right now, not a lot of disruption but it's certainly something that we're managing and we're keeping a close eye on.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And then, on the North America volume side, I'll quickly take that. The U.S. volumes were flat to up very slightly and as we said there were some headwinds around big beer. CSD was relatively flat but we saw some good growth in energy and water and craft and wine, flavored alcoholic beverages. And then, Mexico was really added to get to that 2% growth. Remember, Mexico is very important to us, but as a percent of the total North America, it's about 10% of the volume.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just switching gears, you indicated you're beginning to see customers in Europe alter the packaging mix from plastics to the can. And understanding it's very early days, is it possible to say what beverage categories or countries this is occurring in? And do you have a sense of is this shift really being driven by the beverage producer, or the retailer, or the customer? Any kind of thoughts you could give there would be helpful.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Sure. I would say customers and products that are heavily-weighted to plastic, those customers are concerned because they're getting pressure from end consumers, retailers and the threat of legislation. And all of those things are certainly being factored into some of the larger beverage customers that do have an overweight to plastic, and obviously they're trying to manage their risk profile going forward. And the conversations that we're having are about in the medium- to intermediate-term, helping to make sure that we have supply for them. I don't know if I'd see a significant move in 2019, but I think it would be on 2019 I think things would start to show up. But specific things, even like water, and we mentioned this in our Investor Day, we've seen 100% growth in the UK, off of small numbers but it's still water's moving into cans. You can bet that every category is looking at whether the can is a viable alternative and if they can de-risk their plastic portfolio.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes. Hey. Good morning, John and Scott. First question is on just the tax situation. It sounds to me this higher tax rate tied to working capital was one-time, but could you sort of give us an update on how we should model taxes both in the fourth quarter and next year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, I said the full year rate would be 25%. So the fourth quarter would be a little bit lower than that. This has happened before but it's unusual. We had 40% movement in a couple currencies and that's really what drove the impact in the quarter. So, to have a $0.05 impact in the quarter is a pretty big deal. That is unusual and I would say it's not something you should model going forward. It is a bit one-time.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just to remind us on CapEx, north of $700 million this year and talking about the $1 billion in buybacks for three years plus the $700 million this year, that makes sense how you get that 76 million shares bought back. How much CapEx roughly should we assume is embedded in that for each of those three years?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, we've had a big build in the last couple of years and I think, when we acquired Rexam, we really had a three-and-a-half year game plan of things that we wanted to do. And I would say with the latest announcement of a closure, we're kind of getting close to the end of that three-and-a-half year game plan. But all that could change. So I would expect CapEx to normally fall a decent amount going into next year. But the sustainability thing is a bit of the wild card. If that really takes hold and when it takes hold, that could require more capital going forward, but I think we're going to like the result of that capital. So it's a bit early to call that.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I got you. I got you. But in other words, you're either going to have lower CapEx and get the $1 billion, or you might – maybe it'll slip a little bit because it's such a higher return to pursue some of these projects if you see the sustainability thing take off?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Definitely. We're not going to walk away from good profitable opportunities where we can put capital to work and earn more EVA dollars.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, the last thing, just when we look at the aluminum aerosol business, you mentioned it grew 7% in volumes this last quarter, which I think it's been pacing at that rate for a while. Is that something that should stay in that range or is it sort of seeing an unusual pop right now and then maybe it normalizes, I don't know, low- to mid-single digits? What would you do as you look out a couple years?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, I think we can debate whether it's 5%, 6%, 7%. But in that range – and you have to break it down by geography. We're growing very strongly in India. As you know, that's a few-year-old plant. And as particularly on the deodorant side, that begins to take hold in India, we're seeing very strong growth. And just to give you context, our growth today really hasn't been with the big multinationals. And so, we're starting to see a lot more growth with the multinationals. So we think that's sustainable. You go down into Mexico, which services not only Mexico but also here in North America, and again it's the same thing. We've been growing mid- to upper-single digits in that region off a big base because of the continued penetration on deodorant and other categories for all of North and Central America. And then you go into Europe and the growth is a little bit lower there because it's more mature and it's more penetrated, but we're still seeing good growth there. So you add all those up and then, if we do anything else on the bolt-on acquisition in Greenfield, I think it's only going to accelerate from that 5% to 7%.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on South America. I know you mentioned volumes were down 3%. Do you know what your volumes would have been like if you excluded the conclusion of the end sales and then that loss of business, would you have seen growth?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, let me take that. That's two different issues. One, we were talking about can. Can demand for us was down 3%. You're talking about ends. And remember, because of this contract manufacturing situation, we were selling more ends than we were can. So, when we talk about volume, we're always talking about cans.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So, that 3% drop excludes the ends.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then on Europe, I guess, EBIT – or comparable operating earnings were up $10 million. I think you also had the volume growth and I guess pricing benefits from sourcing and synergies. Were there any offsets I guess from either FX or pricing or start-up costs, just any detail there would be helpful?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Why don't I quickly take that? A couple of things. Number one, remember that we had the start-up of the Cabanillas plant. So, that was a headwind relative to the cost structure just in the near-term we're largely out of that. Number two, remember even in 2018, we had some contracts that still have year-over-year price declines. So, that's a headwind as well. And then, maybe I'll turn it over to Dan because then there was a lot of freight and other things because the volume was so high.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Exactly. The last point is, certainly didn't anticipate 10% growth and we kept all our customers in cans, but it certainly cost us a little bit with ramping up Cabanillas and not having a full supply chain available to manage that. So there's an element where you trigger to a higher growth rate and it becomes hard to kind of leverage and get the flow-through on some of that, those last cans. We are shipping cans a lot further than we typically do just to keep up with the demand.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Your line is open. Please proceed.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First was just a quick follow-up, Scott, on corporate expense, what was the commentary on 2018 corporate expense and how we should think about it going into 2019?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: It should run about $100 million for the full year for 2018. So it'll bump up a little bit in the fourth quarter. We true-up a lot of benefit things in the fourth quarter, so expect it to bump up a little bit, but around $100 million for full-year 2018. And then 2019, too early to tell. But we're at a good trend and we would expect that trend to continue into 2019. We'll see how much.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. And then, Dan, a little bit of a question on sort of the secondary packaging, I mean, we've obviously focused a lot on the primary package being cans versus plastic PET bottles. But when you look at it, there's also a big push on secondary packaging and maybe in some places getting away from paper-based packaging options and moving more towards plastic wrapper, glued all the cans together. How do you think about that in relationship to your offering? And does that cause any additional complexity in the system that you think about as you move towards 2019 and beyond?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Good question. I mean, short answer, no. I mean, we typically work with our customers on their filling operations, and whether it's packaging or exactly the pack mix and the size and the scale of that relative to their thought process. We're pretty dialed-in. And I would say plastic is definitely something that's being contemplated about moving away from, because that's waste in terms of how the retailers view that. And so I think your comment on glue and even the cardboard, those would be more sustainable products that are being contemplated. And so, we're in those discussions with our customers and shouldn't see an impact on us.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And last one for me, when you look at it, some of your major customers have run decent size promotions in 2018. I mean, how do you think about channel inventories and sell-through on some of those newer products? Is it still going strong or should we expect any sort of inventory adjustments as we move into 2019 on those programs?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: North America specific I think is what you're talking about.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Correct.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I'm pretty bullish on – the reality is we could have sold through a heck of a lot more spiked seltzer, had the supply chain talked a little bit more. And I think so what we'll do is we've got a number of customers moving away from historical view on just-in-time inventory. So we can do some pre-builds and things of that nature. So we can get folks set up for success in peak season. So, sometimes the shortness and the inefficiencies in the supply chain and the lost revenue for some of our customers allows us to have a much better dialogue and help them succeed, and that's the kind of conversation I'm seeing right now. So, pretty excited to see what happens in peak season next year.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good. Thanks. How are you?
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good. Good. So I'm still trying to wrap my head around the metal supply issue. Is this more a supplier having trouble with production, or is this a contract issue that's specific to Ball? And then, what gives you confidence on being able to manage through this during the fourth quarter, and will there be any incremental costs specific to this supplier situation?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It is with one supplier, and it was I think specifically their cast house. And so, like I said, we've got a number of folks that have a ton of depth and knowledge with rolling mills, and they've been in, and they've evaluated the situation. And at this point, we've been managing kind of hand-to-mouth. We haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of line productions, but it's just the managing of the day-to-day, the lower daily coil inventory. And all of those things, again, we're managing through them, but they could be concerning if we don't continue to do that.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, no expectation for a cost impact, correct?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Not .
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, moving on to Brazil. So, one of the key soft drinks players in Brazil had mentioned a pull-forward to volumes ahead of the elections in 3Q. Did you feel any impact from any pull-forward in the region? And then how do you feel about 4Q volumes in South America just as we sit today?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'll take the first one. Actually, no is the answer, do we see any pull-through. In fact, in the third quarter, I know overall industry volumes were down in the soft drink side of the business. So we don't see any impact. And as we go in the fourth quarter, Dan, do you want to take that one?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. At this point, I think Q4 and even Q1 peak season down in South America, the only thing we can tell right now is we're running and making every can we could make right now. So it's a little premature to really understand the sell-through. Kind of tail-end of December, beginning of January is when those year-over-year comps and growth rates will start to kick in. But right now we're seeing a really good production build and pull-through from our customers and now it'll just be what's the sell-through. The one caveat in South America is Argentina. We're going to continue to see growth but we'll just see it at a slightly slower rate than we had seen over the last 12 months.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. That makes sense. That's very helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You had talked a little bit about the things you might need to do as you see this shift more aggressively into metal from plastic. But I'm curious how what's happening right now may differ from other shifts to metal that you've seen in the past. Do you get the impression that this is something that would be more immediate or is it kind of similar to past things where there'd be test runs on shifting into the new substrate? And then just trying to understand how flexible your system is to manage this?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Debbie, this is Dan. This would be more pronounced because the level of investment that would be required from our customers to convert plastic lines into can lines, there wouldn't really be an availability to move back and they'd have to set up the retail channels in a way that it would be pretty meaningful kind of that one fell swoop, if you will. We would probably see that in Europe first is the reality.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Europe, you addressed the volume improvement which was pretty nice. I'm just curious, is the 12% margin, is that the right margin? Are you happy with that? I mean, if I look historically, that's a big improvement. I'm just trying to get a sense of what else there is to do in that region going forward if anything?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: No. I think at the outset of the planning phase and where we embarked after the Rexam acquisition, we knew we had a three-year to five-year journey to kind of get back to where the Ball business was prior to the Rexam acquisition, and we still have some opportunities and some growth from a margin expansion standpoint. Stepping more into specialty, becoming more efficient in our manufacturing footprint, making sure we have the right capabilities in the right locations to kind of further diminish the freight disruption, G&A opportunities that we've touch on on the call. So there's still I think a couple years of margin expansion just by kind of getting back in line with what we would have seen historically in our previous European business.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And Debbie, this is John. If you kind of take a step back and recall that, and don't hold me to this number in 2016, but the margins in Europe were well below what we expected and they were in the 9-is%, if I remember correctly. And we said we think we have a line of sight to get to the kind of 12%, 12%-plus margins that we had. I mention that because if 2016 was about 9%, 2017 was about 10%, 2018 is about 11%, and then 2019, we still have all these cost opportunities that Dan just mentioned. So there is the runway that we always talked about.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Morning.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Dan, just one on the North American bev can industry. I may have misheard you, but I think you said the industry is oversold right now. If so, what are industry operating rates compared to historical averages? And why would the industry be oversold if demand is flat to slightly down and when I don't think you've reduced any net capacity?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Well, we have reduced net capacity, and we mentioned that in the Investor Field Trip. I think we took out eight lines and put back in five lines. Secondarily, you're talking about more conversion lines. So you lose efficiencies when you're building or you're putting out into the market more specialty products. So, multiple products off of one line, you're making less can. So, all of that is having an impact on supply-demand.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Operating rates?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: You know what, let me take this because, Adam, the operating rates, when you ran standard 12-ounce and ran them forever, it was a metric that even we use. We don't use that anymore because to Dan's point, if you have, I'm just picking this as an example. If you have one line and you're making six conversions in a year, and then you have increased demand on the spiked seltzer, and all of a sudden you go to nine conversions, you're making a heck of a lot more money than you were on standard 12-ounce, but your operating rates as defined historically are lower than that. So, what I would tell you is, given all that complexity, we are operating as good as we have in the past, but by definition, the "operating rates" are lower.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, John. Just a couple others. On the plastic issue, what are the brand owners, the Cokes and Pepsis of the world, telling you in terms of their preference for cans versus PET? I think at your Analyst Day you talked about the fact that they're actually making more money on PET than can. So, what are they telling you in terms of what their preferences are and what their intentions are in terms of shifting among substrates in the future?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, I think it's largely what we talked about at the Investor Day that historically their profit pools were much bigger on the PET side relative to cans, and through the use of specialty cans, we've been able to meaningfully close that. You layer on top of that with what's happening with the consumer and retailer about pushing more of a sustainable product, and that's exactly what we said at the Investor Day is what our customers are telling us.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And just one last one. Just in terms of your customers, again, some of your large beverage can customers are struggling pretty significantly to the point that the largest brewer in the world just had to cut its dividend in half last week because of weakness in the global beer market. And to what extent do you think your future growth and success is tied to that of your largest customers?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, again, we talked about that at length. Our biggest growth right now is happening in all these other categories and that's what's fueling our growth, not only in the United States but globally, and whether it's energy, whether it's water, whether it's craft, whether it's wine, whether it's spiked seltzers and other FABs, that's where all the incremental growth. And so, what we're seeing is if you think just as a big picture that, call it, 40% of our portfolio in North America is bigger beer, 40% is soft drink, and then 20% is the other categories I just mentioned, yes, the big beer is declining, but remember the can is winning relative to overall volumes. So the can, this quarter, good example, overall volumes for big beer were down 3%-plus, but yet the can was only down 1% because it continues to take share. On the soft drink side, through the use of specialty, it used to be declining, it's relatively flat, and then we're seeing double-digit if not higher growth on that 20% of the portfolio.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Morning.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just wanted to come back to the really strong volumes in both Europe and North America on a relative basis. And the spirit of the question is really just trying to figure out if there are some difficult comps that you would have a year from now. But in Europe specifically, was there a meaningful impact from the World Cup? I know it's been a couple of months since it happened, but just wondering if you saw a deceleration in trends sort of as the quarter went on that would sort of make for a tough comp next year? And then, in North America, you mentioned this year some of the others in the industry probably didn't build inventory to anticipate some growth in some of these sparkling water markets you're talking about. Do you anticipate them to build inventory a little bit differently for next year and such that you might not have some of this spillover business next year?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Good question. I'll start with Europe first. I would say Q3 was less impacted by the World Cup, I mean very little impact. I think what surprised us to the good was the replenishment and the sell-through that was happening in Russia. The can continues to win there and we're continuing to sell through at a pretty brisk clip. How effective that will be next year, and the very good weather that we had through all of Northern Europe and Central Europe, that will be the wild card for comps I would say, less so than is the can winning, are we securing additional substrate penetration, new category launches. All of those things we're seeing really nice tailwinds on. I would say weather will be the wild card for us if we're going to have something similar there in the Northern Europe for an extended period of time. And then, on U.S., I actually feel pretty bullish about next year because I think we and our customers, and if you're following any of the CPG companies in North America, they'll tell you they probably left a little bit on the table this year by trying to manage the just-in-time inventories as opposed to pre-building stock. And so we're having those discussions to set up our customers for success in a more meaningful way next summer. And by all indications, they're feeling pretty bullish about things like spiked seltzers and sparkling water and some of the other new categories that you saw but probably didn't see the extent to which they could have sold through because, candidly, the supply chain wasn't set up to deliver those products at the amount that the end markets would have pulled.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. Just a follow-up on costs in North America. I think you talked about next year getting $50 million of year-over-year improvement from Goodyear and the consolidation that you'd be doing on the manufacturing side. Just wondering does that $50 million include the sort of duplicative cost you have by still having those plants up and running this year? Is that sort of an all-in year-over-year benefit you'd expect? And then, on the freight side, some of the spot rates have started to tick down a little bit. That could just be seasonality. But just wondering if you're seeing or expecting any flattening out or even maybe potentially lower freight rates going forward?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think the $50 million is more or less net once we got full ramp in Goodyear. And there are a number of things that we're working on relative to freight rates both contractually. And to your point, yes, 3% growth during a ramp up period of Goodyear and qualifications and additional conversions, we hope that that normalizes and we pick up some efficiencies just by running our system more effectively next year, absent start-ups.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Your line is open.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks, guys. One last question on Europe. Obviously, you're sort of expecting at least in the near-term growth to sort of moderate there. And I appreciate it depends on where some of the growth materializes. But when you look at your footprint and assuming growth continues even at, call it, a 3% to 5% rate, would this translate into more line additions as it sits right now looking at the footprint or would you be talking about more brick-and-mortar? And sort of asking in the context of, looking back to CapEx over the past few years, it was a little bit elevated, call it, $500 million to $550 million. What type of return capital is embedded in that sort of a CapEx figure versus sort of your maintenance and safety environmental spend?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. It's a great question. In the near-term, it's more lines within existing bricks and mortar. That's the short answer. And our folks have gone through every one of our facilities, and knows whether it's a full line, whether it's just a couple extra pieces of equipment, how much output can we get within the existing bricks and mortar. That's our near-term focus. I think to both what Scott and Dan were talking about earlier, if longer-term there is a much more pronounced growth that's sustainable, we will look at bricks and mortar. But as we sit here today, that is not on our near-term horizon.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Helpful, John. And then one last one. It seems like you guys tweaked the language a little bit in terms of M&A pipeline or at least allocating capital that direction, appreciating that those things are more opportunistic or episodic in nature. But are there parts of the portfolio – I mean you talked about aluminum aerosol where you look to I guess allocate that capital. I mean I know the beverage business is pretty well filled out in a couple different geographies.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Perhaps, I think, you may be reading a little bit too much in the parsing words because nothing fundamentally has changed.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Melody, why don't we go? It's getting near top the hour. Why don't we just go with one more question if there is – are anymore?
Operator: Yes. We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Guys, just a point of clarification, the specialty growth that you saw in the quarter that you said was double-digit, was that for North America or was that for the platform globally? That's question number one. Question number two, especially with your beverage customers, how many roughly would you say as a percentage-basis have already established sustainability goals by 2021 or 2025 or what have you? And how many have yet to establish such goals? Just curious about that. Thank you and good luck in the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. George, this is John. To answer your question on specialty, it's both.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: We're double-digits both in North America as well as globally across the system. With respect to sustainability, the vast majority of our customers have either put out specific goals by 2025 or 2030, or they have established an intent over the next years to finalize such goals.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And George, there's nothing fundamentally specific about substrate mix shift in there. And so, that's the difficulty of trying to parse through some of the data relative to when you can anticipate this. That's why with some of our partners, we're getting indications because they're starting to plan and they're doing mindful planning about how many lines, how many can lines, and where? And so those conversations, like we mentioned in the Investor Day, are happening. They were not happening a year ago, they're happening today.
George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. I mean our sense is a lot of those initial goals, as they were set out, the customers were beginning to be concerned whether they can actually hit them or not. And so, that may be one of the reasons that you're seeing the intensified discussion. But anyway, thank you and good luck in the quarter, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you, George. And thank you, everyone. Melody, I think we're concluded.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Ball Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday August 2, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you, Malika, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company's news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global Beverage Packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business as well as the outlook for our company. Momentum continues across our businesses. Comparable operating earnings were up 11% year over year, as we continued to execute our strategies of achieving better value for our products through higher returns for our standard products and higher growth for our specialty products, aggressive cost-out programs in both our fixed and variable costs, and completing several large growth capital projects. Our comparable operating earnings improvement was despite a number of headwinds, including higher U.S. freight rates, an 11-day Brazilian trucker strike that affected shipments in May, soft domestic U.S. beer volumes, and to a smaller extent, currency. Our aerospace business continued to add to its already record high backlog, and its prospects have only grown with time. In addition, in this quarter we announced and subsequently closed on the sale and formation of a joint venture for our U.S. tinplate food and tinplate aerosol business to Platinum Equity, where we received approximately $600 million in after-tax cash proceeds and will retain a 49% interest going forward. This transaction was the right thing for the business and for Ball Corporation, and it will allow us to immediately free up capital that was generating below our 9% after-tax return on capital threshold while retaining future upside in the business. The transaction does not include our global aluminum aerosol business, which continues to win around the globe relative to other substrates. Our LTM comparable EBITDA through June 30, 2018 was $1.87 billion, and we are making progress toward achieving both our EBITDA and free cash flow targets in 2018 and 2019. Our deleveraging has been ahead of schedule, and we've been actively repurchasing our stock and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, a commitment we made when we embarked upon the global beverage can acquisition. As we continue to leverage our scale to further promote aluminum packaging growth through sustainability initiatives, I invite you to read our biennial Sustainability Report, scheduled to be released on August 7. We have an obligation to educate consumers, customers, retailers, and other stakeholders that aluminum packaging is the most sustainable package from an environmental, social, and economic perspective, and the choice for consumers of all generations. Our products are on the right side of the environmental debate, and that is certainly a tailwind for Ball, not only in beverage packaging, but also in our aerospace business, where much of our civil work is focused on creating and disseminating environmental intelligence. Now moving on to the results for the second quarter, our South American business delivered solid performance despite the trucker strike in Brazil, which cost us approximately $10 million in comparable operating earnings. Our European business continued to sequentially improve on its performance through cost-out and volume growth. Though our North American business continued to incur out-of-pattern freight and startup costs related to our new Goodyear, Arizona facility and lower volumes due to softness in domestic beer, other categories like CSD, crafts, sparkling water, import beer, energy drinks, wine, and other emerging categories continue to grow. And we've begun to execute on our value-over-volume strategy to address the long-stated need that our standard products do not generate the appropriate returns for the capital employed. Anticipated cost savings were also realized in our G&A, our Spain and Arizona startups, and the plant optimizations in Birmingham, Alabama and Cuiabá, Brazil are complete. Global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 5% in the quarter, and our tinplate food and aerosol asset sale was completed, as I mentioned earlier, this week. Lastly, our Aerospace business continued to grow its contracted backlog, and hiring continues at a very rapid pace. While the hiring surge and ramp up of new programs had a bit of a drag in the second quarter, we expect material operating earnings improvement over the coming quarters. So despite continued U.S. domestic industry volume declines and volatile volumes in EMEA, the strength of our business, its strong cash flow and EVA returns, and the continued progress on our efforts and initiatives certainly offset any such headwinds. We remain confident that certain customer-specific volume softness will in no way impact our ability to achieve our near-term targets. Within the last two weeks, we also received the good news that Ball was awarded exclusions on U.S. aluminum tariffs for certain countries' can sheet supply – great work done by our sourcing and government affairs teams. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, actively managing our supply and demand, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products, and expanding aerospace with an EVA and return of value to shareholder mindset. As fellow Ball shareholders, investors can count on us being good stewards of our capital and cash flow. All in, excellent execution by our global teams. Thank you to all of our employees for delivering on our commitments while dealing with the complexity of numerous projects and process initiatives to position our company for consistent long-term growth and strong free cash flow. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Our global beverage business operating earnings were up 9% year to date. As John mentioned, it was a busy and rewarding quarter across global beverage. Our team completed two plant startups on time and on budget. And we kept up with strong demand for beverage cans across Europe, Russia, and Brazil during World Cup, despite a few transitory hiccups outside of Ball's control like transportation strikes and brief CO2 shortages. Our global specialty mix remains at approximately 40%, and network optimization activities to balance standard can production and geographically position the broader specialty can portfolio in the U.S. are right on schedule, with Birmingham ceasing end production at the end of the quarter and Chatsworth and Longview slated to cease production by the end of the third quarter. All of this is possible given the successful startup of Goodyear's two lines in the first half and the ongoing startups of lines three and four by the end of August. Note that the U.S. network optimization just described results in no new net capacity, and Scott will address the CapEx to fully scale out the Goodyear plant. European process transformation projects to further improve our cost structure continue. And additional network optimization through the closure of one-line Cuiabá, Brazil plant will allow us to leverage equipment elsewhere in the South American network. Ultimately, we are aligning with the right customers and markets, expanding into new products and capabilities via our ever-expanding offering our specialty can sizes, leveraging our technical knowhow around predictive maintenance, light-weighting, and process improvement, and positioning our products as the most sustainable in the world. The economic value creation the can brings our customers is real and growing. Moving to the individual segments, Ball's North American segment profits were up slightly despite shipments being down just over 3%, all consistent with our first quarter commentary. Growth in Mexican imports, craft, sparkling water, wine, and energy is very healthy, but just wasn't enough to offset domestic beer volume declines, roughly $7 million of out-of-pattern freight and roughly $5 million to $7 million of startup expense in the quarter. Hats off to our North America team. There have been more headwinds than tailwinds this quarter, but that will flip in the second half. July beverage can shipments are strong and our supply/demand balance is tight. With this more favorable volume trend and a moderation of startup costs and out-of-pattern freight, the segment is positioned for notable growth in the second half and will also benefit from fixed cost savings in late 2018 and beyond following the previously mentioned plants closing late this quarter. Our South American business was unable to claw back all of the impact of the 11-day trucker strike, but given the scale and size of our Brazilian operations performing $3 million lower in the quarter versus 2017 was an accomplishment. Segment shipments grew nearly 5% and, as we've teed up since late last year, underperformed Brazilian industry trends in the quarter. Overall beer consumption trends in Brazil improved, and our customers continue to emphasize cans across South America. Our business is positioned well for 2019 and beyond. The timetable for expansions in Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile are on track, and we are excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America. As we have acknowledged the past couple of quarters, we continue to anticipate tougher year-over-year comps in the second half for our Brazilian business due to the profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract that supported the divestment business going away, tougher year-over-year volume comparisons and our value-over-volume response that played out in late 2017. Thanks again to our South American colleagues. We appreciate how effectively the team responded to the trucker strike and how quickly the business got back to normal. The European business earnings were up 14% year over year, and once again saw mid-single-digit volume growth, led by Russia and Continental Europe. Our new Spain facility is shipping cans, and near and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to our Ball's legacy business was or are on track. Transformation projects are progressing nicely and will contribute to planned G&A savings in 2019. In EMEA, demand volatility remains. Saudi continues to be difficult. And on the positive side, we are seeing a better operating and demand environment in Turkey and India. Our China business continues to be cash flow positive, and we'll continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this country. In summary, significant projects are up and running. Supply/demand is tightening, and contract renewals are on the horizon. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. You're doing a great job. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Comparable second quarter 2018 earnings were $0.58 versus $0.53 in 2017. Second quarter diluted earnings per share reflect solid operational performance across our packaging businesses and lower corporate costs, offset by higher taxes and slightly higher interest expense. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Net debt ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, $200 million lower than first quarter and after a net share buyback of $175 million through the first six months. For 2018, we expect CapEx to be in in excess of $700 million, as excellent progress on major projects allows us to bring spending forward. The increased CapEx along with the timing of the sale of the U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses at the seasonal peak of the working capital build will put our free cash flow in the range of $800 million for the full year. Full-year 2018 interest expense is now expected to be just above $300 million. The full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be approximately 24% based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform, and corporate undistributed will be just under $110 million for the full year 2018. Keep in mind that due to the sale of our steel food and steel aerosol assets versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares, it will be slightly dilutive to the second half earnings, likely in the range of $0.05. Prospectively, on a full-year basis, the transaction will be neutral to slightly positive relative to diluted earnings per share due to the incremental share repurchase and definitely positive to EVA dollar generation in 2019. The cash flow was strong, and year to date through yesterday we have repurchased 8.34 million shares or $318 million worth of our stock, just over a 2% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And by year end, we expect our stock buyback to approach $700 million in addition to paying out roughly $140 million in dividends. It's exciting to be able to ramp up our return of value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported higher revenues and slightly lower second quarter operating earnings results, driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up of new contracts, offset by incremental labor costs while we rapidly scale up our labor base. Our staffing levels continue to increase, and year to date we've hired approximately 540 new employees and anticipate adding another 200 to 400 employees over the next 12 months. The aerospace team has done an excellent job managing this large onboarding process without taking their eyes off the execution of our business. We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, world-class technology, and the best talent in the industry to further grow our aerospace business. With contracted backlog at record levels and our won-not-booked backlog at $4.3 billion, the future looks bright for aerospace for the next three to five years. And as I mentioned earlier, the compressed timing of onboarding such a large number of new employees temporarily compressed second quarter earnings, but we expect significant and material operating earnings improvement over the coming quarters. Now, as we look forward for our corporation, we are on track to achieve our targets. We are actively managing and oriented our asset base within an EVA-accretive approach. We are leading the charge to ensure aluminum packages for beverage and aerosol are the most sustainable packages on the globe. And our aerospace business is operating from a position of strength as we ramp up and scale out our people, processes, and infrastructure. It's been over two years since we closed on the largest acquisition in our company's 138-year history. We've delivered through some pretty interesting global economic and political dynamics. It's time to look beyond 2019. And with that in mind, we are having our investor field trip in Colorado on October 1 and 2. So please reach out to Ann Scott if you're interested in meeting our broader team and learning more about the "and beyond." For now, our balance sheet leverage is where we want it. The capital investments have been made. We are taking seriously the opportunities afforded us through our commercial, manufacturing, and supply chain activities. The outlook is on track. And we're a buyer of all stock. There's probably not much more to say. So with that, we'll turn it over the Q&A. Malika, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. And our first question on the phone line is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the details. I'll ask a few questions and turn it over and try to come back. I guess in terms of the outlook and guidance in relation to the transaction with Platinum, I think you mentioned, John – or Scott, that the back half of the year will be diluted about $0.05 just because of timing, and yet you're maintaining your outlook for 2019, recognizing I'm shifting gears a bit here. What within your ongoing fundamentals, your integration of Rexam is going sufficiently well that you can maintain the guidance even though this is a somewhat dilutive transaction initially anyway to earnings and to cash flow?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: George, why don't I take 2019, then I'll turn it over to Scott to give more color on the 2018? But when we started a couple years ago, we talked about the $2 billion and $1 billion in 2019. And that included our tinplate business, as you know. As part of the transaction, it was announced that for the fiscal year 2017, it reported EBITDA of about $78 million. And as you know, 2017 was not a good year in that business, so there was some growth. So embedded in the $2 billion was somewhat south of $100 million of EBITDA that we just divested. But despite that, things are going well. We are accelerating some of the capital that we're going to be able to generate that incremental value in 2019. And so we think we can close that gap and still maintain the $2 billion of EBITDA guidance and $1 billion of free cash flow, despite losing just under $100 million of EBITDA and equivalent free cash flow from the food and aerosol business.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And the dilutive nature of the transaction is really just timing because we'll start buying stock. We've got a lot of stock to buy in the back half of the year. And once we get to the end of the year, it should all be trued up. So on a full-year basis, it we really won't be dilutive going forward.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, I appreciate that. I think next question I want to just review is contracts, commercial efforts, and the like, and there are a couple more I think references to value-over-volume in this press release. I know you can't go contract by contract or give a lot of detail. But can you give us a little bit more in terms of the undercurrent in terms of your progress there? And I think you mentioned in EMEA, you have a bit more in the way of contract renewals. Did I hear that right, and how are those related? And then lastly, if you can, Scott, back to the CapEx question going up $100 million, can you comment at all, other than the amount of spending increment, where you're putting that capital? Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks, George. This is John. I'll start. That was a mouthful, I think. But first, with respect to our commercial strategies, for the past couple years, we have been very consistent, that said that the returns that are generated on the standard containers do not, for us, meet the hurdle rate to continue reinvesting in that. And so we have talked for a while now about our value-over-volume strategy. We also talked over the last couple conference calls that we have a couple of rather larger contracts coming up in Europe at the end of 2018 and in the United States at the end of 2019, and nothing has changed at all. We are in execution mode. And I will also say, though, that you also know it's Ball's policy that we don't negotiate nor talk about customer contracts in a granular level on investor conference calls. So the only guidance I can give you is we are right in the throes of what we've said for the last two years we'd be doing.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And on the CapEx front, our teams have done – all of these things were planned, George. It was just a matter of the timing of them. But our teams have done an excellent job of executing on the big projects that we have going on so we're able to accelerate the later phases of these programs. So Dan mentioned bringing up lines three and four here in the back half of the year in Goodyear, adding a second line to the Spain plant. We're adding a warehouse in Monterrey to support the growth in that business; and to support our aerospace backlog, moving up some of the build-out of some of our test facilities. So these are all above-average return projects. And frankly, I'm usually a capital curmudgeon in terms of spending, but the faster we can do these things, the faster we'll get the returns and the longer we'll get to enjoy them.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And maybe I can add some color to the capital just for the beverage piece, and then I'll address your EMEA contract question. Goodyear, just to scale it, Goodyear is approximately $250 million. Cabanillas, our Spain facility, is approximately $150 million. We put up a fourth line, mega-line to support our 24 and 25-ounce growth in Conroe. That's approximately $60 million to $70 million. And then you've got ongoing M&R in the range of $100 million to $125 million. So it's obviously some significant one-time capital throws but it's been contemplated. It's being executed against, and obviously it's going to allow us to qualify customers sooner and get after some of the fixed cost savings maybe a quarter earlier than we had anticipated. So, I'm really pleased with all of that. And then in EMEA, George, I would frame EMEA similar to contract lengths in North America. Our EMEA business, as you know, is principally Egypt, Turkey, India, and Saudi. And those contract durations are somewhere in the neighborhood of two to five years, so they don't turn over as frequently as, say, a China. And there are really no substantive changes in that market. It's consistent with where we entered the year and what we had contemplated a couple years ago in the guidance that we gave.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks, George.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just a question on the trends in North America. A lot of the volume headwinds have been well documented. It seems like your comments imply a little bit of an improvement. I think even July you said things are improving there. I just wonder if you could expand on that. What are you seeing heading into 3Q and what gives you confidence that we might flip to growth at some point in the near future in that segment?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure, you heard correctly. We saw strength in June and then that's followed through in July. And it's essentially April and May there wasn't a ton of promotional activity by the major customers. You've seen a lot of innovation in terms of new products and new categories being pushed, especially in the mega beer customer. And so we're seeing those, and so we think there's probably a shift of Q2 softness into Q3 strength. So I think it's just a timing issue if nothing else.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that makes sense. And then one question about the announcement on the can plant in Brazil you had to shut down. The volumes have been really strong in that region. I'm just wondering why they need to close it. I know it's just a one-line plant, so I'm guessing some of it's efficiency gains, but any impact of that to overall volume? Do you think you'll be able to house those customers from other plants, and any color on any fixed cost savings or margin shift from it?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: You've hit it on the head. Really, what we're doing is we're taking a one-line can plant, taking the fixed cost out of it, and moving that equipment into other facilities, so we're not necessarily losing any capacity. And we are taking out fixed costs. In the grand scheme of Ball Corporation, it's not a huge deal. But anytime you can take fixed costs out, that's what we look to do, and that's what we're doing here.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, thank you. I just had a question on South America. I guess it seems, at least versus our estimate, to have been a little bit better in the second half, especially when you take out the strike. Just when you think second half and I guess the full year, is it doing a little bit better, I guess, than maybe you previously thought, or just still in line?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I think it's largely in line. Q2 was so disruptive because of the 11-day trucker strike in terms of volume dynamics. But I would say volumes were better in Q1, hard to distinguish what actually happened in Q2 from a volume trend perspective. But based on what we're hearing from our customers, we think the can will continue to win, and we should do well in the second half. I would just reference my comments relative to the INS manufacturing agreement in the second half for year-over-year comps. I'm just speaking of volumes here.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: The only other thing I'd add is let's not forget that there's an election in Brazil this fall. And elections when they happen down in Brazil, they tend to create more volatility. So I think the caution you hear from us is really just more about an unknown than anything other than what Dan said that we know. It's just that these elections just create greater volatility. And it's not until the beginning of the fourth quarter that we're going to have this election.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And I think, Dan, you said, with the startup in North America, startup costs were $5 million to $7 million this quarter and then freight was $7 million. Do you have a sense of – I know you think it will get better – but in the second half, are just higher freight rates going to cause any pressure? I would think actually startup costs go down, but just any details around that would be helpful.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: June was definitely a spike in freight rates. I would expect to see some of that continue. In that $7 million out-of-pattern freight number that I indicated, probably $2 million to $3 million of that was self-induced really because of the startup costs. So I think that that number would be mitigated somewhat, but we'll continue to see headwinds on freight for the foreseeable future unless there's any kind of underlying changes. We should get the fixed cost savings like I identified. The startups are going extremely well. Some of the competitors I think have recently said they're looking to broker additional cans. We'll be the beneficiaries of that hopefully as a result of an excellent startup phase. So freight rates will continue, probably in line with what we've seen, but we've got a lot of tailwinds heading our way in the second half of the year in that business.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it, thanks, and then just a final question for Scott. Do you have – I know you're actually pulling forward some CapEx. And I know you had always used $500 million roughly as a placeholder. And I know it's early, but have you looked into 2019? Just do you have any thoughts on what CapEx could look like?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think we've been able to accelerate some of these programs that we had planned quite some time ago, so I think we'll see a meaningful drop in CapEx as we get into 2019.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think just to amplify that Dan did a good job of laying out the really big projects on the beverage side, and that added up to well in excess of $550 million. Layer on we're spending $100 million a quarter in aerospace alone this year on building out our manufacturing footprint here, that's where you can see how we're getting to the $700 million. And when you think about, as we sit here today, those big projects that are going on in 2019, most of what Dan referenced will not be there. Aerospace will still have some elevated expenditure, but not to the level it is now. So it should come down meaningfully from where it is this year.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I would expect it to be lower than depreciation next year.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. Okay, thanks so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks, everyone. Dan, just one question on your North American commentary, you mentioned your system is tight at this point. The segment was down 3% on volume in the first half of the year roughly. So I know you said July was better, but what exactly is causing the tightness given the volume decline you've experienced thus far?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I would say reference my comments just previously. But in April and May, April and May was just a function – it's promotional spend. You see significant declines in April and May on promotional spend by really the big customers. That spend has come back in conjunction with them pushing candidly a number of different new innovative products. All of that needed additional time to be marketed, and that's all selling through. And we've seen the benefits. Both in June we saw it, and thus far through July and into early August. So I think it's more of a timing issue, 2% to 3%, than anything just because of the promotional activity.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And don't forget going forward, Dan also mentioned about the closure of Chatsworth as well as Longview, Texas.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right, the capacity actions will be neutral to your overall capacity, right?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: That's correct. That's correct.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just, John, one more on I think what George was asking with the 2019 EBITDA. So if you're selling almost $100 million of EBITDA, I know it was a $78 million in 2017 and I don't know what it is now. But call it $80 million – $90 million. You referenced a number of external headwinds that the company has dealt with since you closed the Rexam deal, yet you're, it sounds like, effectively increasing your underlying EBITDA guidance by almost $100 million despite all these headwinds. So I'm just trying to better understand where that's coming from exactly, if there's a particular region that's been going markedly better than expected, just a little more detail there would be helpful. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think it's excellent execution across all the regions. When I think off the top of my head, Europe is still on its journey but is delivering above what we initially expected. I think in North America, we still have a lot of on-the-come opportunities in terms of the fixed cost savings that Dan mentioned, but things are going well there. I think in South America, I think our sourcing strategies is above where we were. So there's not just one or two specific buckets. I think across the board, our business has been executing quite well. That combined with the aerospace business is growing faster than what we expected as well. So yes, we have some headwinds. Yes, we're selling off $80 million to $100 million in EBITDA. And yes, we still think we can make the $2 billion of EBITDA in 2019.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I think another point that we've commented on but maybe gets lost in this is, and maybe we should be tooting our own horn a little bit more, the project startups in Goodyear and Spain, six lines in greenfield facilities have gone remarkably well. And if those had not gone well, we would be having challenges and out-of-pattern freight qualifications with customers. And I think as we sit here today, we're much more on our toes with regard to those two projects, which we banked a lot on in terms of fixed cost savings in 2019.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. In the North American business, it seems like you might be set up for a good second half. When I think about last year, you had the hurricanes and then related freight and supply chain costs. Is it possible to size how much of a benefit you could get from the non-repeat of hurricane and hurricane-related costs?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: What we said last year and then it's really playing out and what we're anticipating as well was about we had a $30 million headwind, out-of-pattern freight, lost sales, inefficiencies from a production and absorption standpoint. Based on what we noted and what we're seeing out of the North America business, we should recover all of that. And hopefully, if things continue to go well from an execution standpoint and volume comes through, we'll see that year over year.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching gears, John, you talked in your prepared remarks about the environmental benefits of cans. And I'm wondering with regard to some of the regulatory and media scrutiny on plastics, maybe especially in Europe, is this something that big customers are proactively coming to you about and you think could really drive incremental volumes this year or next year, or is it more of a general observation or something that you think could gain traction further on? Just any kind of color you could give there would be helpful.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think it has both short-term and long-term implications. I think the opportunity is probably greater in the long term because in the short term, inner material substitution you don't see a lot of. But this does play into our commercial strategy that we said we're trying to anticipate and really push from a retailer perspective, an NGO and government perspective, a customer and consumer perspective, the benefits of the can. But we also have to be in a position to be willing and able to invest in it where the returns are good. And on the specialty, we've been doing a very good job there. And so, we need to get the standard up. But I think in terms of specifically what you're talking about around inner material shifts, I think in the short term that it's incremental, but I do think there's long-term benefits here if we play this right. And I encourage you to come to our October 1 and 2 Investor Day because we're going to be talking a lot more about the commercial reasons of why this is in our great interest to be pushing this.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: On the long-term front, specific to the major customers, I can add just a little color. What we're doing now far more than we've done even a year ago is we're sitting down with our major customers and we are collaborating with them on science-based targets. And some of the targets have to do with 100% recycled packaging substrate. Now the targets these customers are putting out are 2025 and 2030. That's why we're saying longer term. Absolutely, we know we're putting programs in place. How quickly that manifests itself, we need to just continue to push the message in work because ,especially in Europe, as you indicated, right now it's happening and the conversations are shifting. And just to give you a little teaser come early October, we've looked at every major region in which we operate. And whether it's on the soft drink side, the beer side, or the other categories which is energy and sparkling waters, et cetera, we've looked at what a 1 percentage point share shift from another substrate to the can means, and it's meaningful bottom line improvement to our company. And that is why the economic case of trying to create these greater profit pools for our customers by using cans can be good for them and good for us.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Scott, I just wanted to go back. I didn't quite catch all of your comments on share repo year to date, or I don't know if you gave it at the end of the quarter. And would your expectation on a go-forward basis be to go back to the – I call it the old methodology where you did most of your share repurchases in 1Q on a go-forward basis?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: So what we've purchased, what's in the 10-Q is $175 million for the year, but we purchased heavy since the end of – I'm sorry, for the six months. Sorry, for the six months. But what we purchased year to date as of yesterday, so we put a program in place. We were blacked out for much of the quarter because of the food transaction. So once we were out of that, we repurchased heavy. And so as of yesterday, we repurchased $318 million worth of our stock or 8.3 million shares, just over 2% For the rest of the year, we plan to approach $700 million, so it's another 3% of the shares or 10 million shares that should come out between now and the end of the year, as we basically spend the proceeds of the food transaction and our cash flow. Going forward, we will orient – our leverage will be down to a point – we're almost there now. I think we're at 3.6 times at the end of the quarter. We said when we're at 3 to 3.5 times that we'll turn all of our free cash flow to buy back our stock and our dividend. So that's a lot of stock to buy over the course of the year, and we'll be opportunistic and we'll see how that plays out in terms of the timing early in the year versus throughout the year. You could probably count on more in the first half of the year but buying throughout the year.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And maybe splitting hairs a little bit, but when you had the announcement on the steel food, steel aerosol JV, it sounded – you made the comment that the guidance for 2019 was going to be more challenging to achieve, but I would say you sound extremely confident today. Is there anything that changed in the last, whatever, month and a half that would give you significantly more confidence than you had at that point in time?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No is the short answer. I think when we put together two years ago the $2 billion EBITDA target for 2019, there were a lot of unknowns. We have derisked those unknowns, and we feel more confident. But having said that, when you're taking $80 million, $90 million, $100 million of EBITDA off the table through the sale of the food and aerosol business, you have an $80 million, $90 million, $100 million gap you need to fill. We have confidence that we have game plans to fill that, and that's exactly what we're doing. But there still is incremental risk. We still haven't realized the $50 million net savings here in North America around the three plant closures. That's still on the come and there's still other programs like that, but we have a line of sight to what we need to do. That's the important part.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's a big EBITDA hole to fill, so good luck filling that with some of these improvements. Just lastly for me, on the exclusion from the aluminum tariffs, is that an industry issue, or is that something Ball-specific that you were discussing there?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: That was Ball-specific. The industry cannot petition the Department of Commerce for exclusion. It has to be company by company, and we received last week the news that we received an important exclusion.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys. A quick question on beer consumption in the U.S. For a while, Mexican imports were offsetting production in the U.S. But you saw the article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal regarding how Americans were drinking less beer, with younger people preferring cocktails and wine. Like how do you position the company for a sustained decline in beer consumption, and that would include imports and everything else? So how do you position the company for something like that?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: So, I guess the data that you're referencing is nothing new over the last decade. I would say that, number one. And number two, you're talking about beer literage. You're not talking about the can. The can has disproportionately won share over that period of time. Craft beer continues grow, in the quarter up 35%. I think we look to things like seltzers, waters, wine we're getting into in a big way, energy. You've got to win in the categories that are winning I think is the answer. But the can continues to win from a substrate standpoint, and overall can volume for beer has grown slightly over the last five years. And if we continue to win in the markets that we're participating in, that's how we'll hedge our bet.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: The only thing I'll add – this is John – is in reference to the article you mentioned. It was describing a slow decline of traditional beer, and that's correct. But as Dan just pointed out, spiked seltzers and all the alternative categories that the beer makers are really pushing, we can tell you with great certainty that the spiked sparkling category this summer is growing faster than anyone anticipated. And so yes, that is taking share from what I would describe as traditional beer. It's still a malt beverage, which is the important part. And the can by far is disproportionately winning in that. So when Dan talks about focusing on wine and focusing on these new categories, spiked seltzer is a great example of that.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: No, that makes sense. And also, in terms of the profitability of the different products, does it matter to you whether those customers are selling more seltzers and other products versus beer?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yes, the short answer, they're going into specialty cans, number one. And number two, they're being sold in many instances in single-serve at higher profit pools. And if our customers are selling at a higher price, we have the opportunity to sell to them at a higher price. So the economic equation works really well on those introductory new beverage categories.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great, thanks. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning, Arun.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just a question following up here on that same issue. I guess first off, have you noticed any changes? You referred to increased promotional spending. Is that a structural shift amongst your customers? I imagine that they're not happy, the large brewers, with the volume trends. Have they increased their spending at a sustained level from here on, and do you think that's going to have a material impact on master volumes? And similarly, I think we've noticed something similar on the CSD side. So, A), has that actually happened, and do you think that's actually resulting in improved volume recovery? Thanks.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I can't comment on the long-term promotional spend, if it's going to be more in social media, if it's going to be different outlets, if it's going to be a different dollar spend or a different target. I will tell you that the largest brewer in the world has made a comment that they want to shift their product mix from 80% traditional to 20% alternative. In that 20% space, it will overwhelmingly be new products and it will overwhelmingly be cans. And so, I'm more interested in those new products candidly winning and us winning at a disproportionate rate, than I am concerned about the promotional spend activity on the core brands. Another major brewer, just to add context, in North America recently made wholesale changes in their marketing department. That marketing department was not concentrated on core brand innovation over the last handful of years and their core products declined. And so, I think there's some rethinking going on, different thought in some of the major brewers, and we will be there to help them from an innovation standpoint, and they will be knocking on our door first. But what happens going forward and where they spend their money is yet to be determined, I think.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, are there other mechanisms you can take on the pricing side to offset any of the inflation that you're seeing, whether it be non-metal but like freight and so on? And then what's the appetite for that kind of initiative? Would it be more challenging given soft volumes in North America and Europe, or is it a potential likelihood that you could actually achieve something like that? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: We've talked about this a lot in past conference calls. And when you're talking about your commercial strategy, it's just not price. It's everything from terms. It's who bears the freight and how that mechanic worked. It talks about call-off and having call-off windows that if you're in a 72-hour window, it's at one price, and then there's a surcharge if you want to move it inside of that. And so there's a whole host of various things going on. And as I said, we're not going to negotiate or talk about any individual conversations with customers on our conference call, but I also said that we are in execution mode as we sit here right now.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess going back to the second quarter, I know we've talked quite a bit about 2019. And specific to Europe, how much of a benefit do you think you realized from the World Cup? How should we think about volumes in the region for the back half of 2018? And also, was there any sort of mix impact during the second quarter that was unfavorable? I'm just trying to reconcile the 6% volume growth with the reported 5.7% sales increase.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I would say there was definitely some benefit to us, and I think it had more to do with the fact that it was in Russia, and we have a very strong footprint in Russia. So that had more to do with it. And the other thing that happened in Europe, Ghansham, that you're probably aware of is in the north the weather was remarkably good. So there were a couple elements that really furthered that strength. I think the overall European market was probably closer to 4% – 5% growth and we were closer to 6%. And so I think that benefit had to do with our footprint, candidly, in Russia and the benefit of the World Cup.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And, Ghansham, I'll just point out on the volume versus revenue line, remember that we talked about in the first quarter that we still have a couple of contracts where it's year-over-year price declines that we inherited, and those end at the end of this year.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it, that's helpful. And then since you last reported, the foreign exchange environment has changed dramatically, particularly as it relates to the emerging markets, some of the countries you operate in, Argentina, Turkey, et cetera. Can you just help us think through any sort of risk in the back half of the year? Are you seeing anything different than the underlying trend in the first half in those few regions?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, it was definitely more volatile. The markets, and John referenced this on his comments from an operating earnings standpoint, we had some headwinds definitely in Argentina, in Russia, and Turkey in the second quarter. We had some offsetting things as it relates on the corporate side. So the net impact when you get down to the earnings per share wasn't very much. Going forward, volatility seems to be a little bit less. But we're pretty well positioned to be able to deal with the currencies.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'll just add one other thing. Obviously, any time currencies relative to the dollar devalue, it makes our product more expensive because our products are typically dollar-priced. So you never like to see that. Having said that, when we think about what we see right now in the places Scott just mentioned, Russia, Turkey, and Argentina, can demand continues to be very strong there. Now, Russia was the World Cup. Turkey, it still has good economic growth. And even in Argentina, there's package share mix that's favoring the can there. But we keep our antenna up pretty closely to see if there's any adverse demand impact related to this, and we haven't seen anything yet.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, just one final one. Going back to the comments on beer on the U.S., clearly it has been impacted by changing consumer preferences in the U.S. Perhaps it's had some parallels with what soft drinks went through over a decade ago in this country as well. How do you think more broadly about portfolio risk, specifically the U.S.? What's your beer exposure? I know craft beer has been growing. But if the category does start to slow more broadly, including craft beer, how should we think about your ability to perhaps do what you've been doing with tiering your customers on the soft drink side with specialty cans, et cetera? Is that an opportunity for you?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Absolutely, the specialty can and the new categories. At the end of the day, the major brewers are going to have to figure out how to sell products that the end consumer wants, and I think they're learning that pretty quickly. And I think your correlation to CSD is a good one. Just looking behind innovation pipelines and what we see and what we're working with those customers on, it looks a heck of a lot like five, six, seven years ago with the CSD folks. The other comment, and some of it just has to do with our exposure to the core brands that are declining, we have a lot less exposure to that just from a structural standpoint in North America because the two major brewers are vertically integrated. And so a lot of that they're feeling on the backs of their system, so we felt less of it. And the folks in the customers and the categories that we're dealing with, the craft side, et cetera, those continue to do really well. So we've gotten out ahead of that aspect or this aspect that we're talking about, and we've got the vertical integration buffer, if you will, just because of the North American market and how it's structured.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks for all the detail.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: You've got it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted...
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...to go back to that aluminum tariff exclusion. Does it cover your entire portfolio? And is there any financial impact to you, or is it more to your customers that you would pass it through to?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: First and foremost, we pass it through to our customers. So it's about making sure that the beverage can is competitive. It is related. It doesn't affect all of our – because the majority of our metal we acquire here in the United States, but there's not necessarily enough capacity to acquire 100% of it in the United States. And so we procure metal from a particular supplier in the Middle East, and that is what we were given an exclusion for.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thank you. That makes sense. And then my other question is the Brazilian trucker strike, do you expect any carryover impact in 3Q or 4Q?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'll quickly handle that. No is the short answer. One of the things just to watch out generally is with these elections coming up, there's going to be a lot of labor issues. We can't tell you what they are, but it always happens this way when you have the economy in Brazil as it is and the political disruption as it is. Many of the unions put forth their strong views on certain things, and that's just to watch out. We know nothing specific, but those things can happen from time to time.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And I think for full disclosure, it was a – the agreement that was reached was a temporary one, 90 to 120-day. So this all plays into the new election and what happens there. So based on what we're seeing right now and how we're operating, we don't foresee any additional disruptions. But there's always that lingering event out there with the election and the fact that this wasn't a permanent agreement.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right, okay. Thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: All right, thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, just one on the Middle East. I guess notwithstanding a lot of geopolitical volatility over there, can you talk about just underlying demand and as we start to lap the sugar tax over there? And any response in the competitive landscape that you can speak of?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure. Just to reiterate, our EMEA region is Egypt, Turkey, Saudi, and India. And Saudi, I would say it continues to be incredibly weak. And I would have anticipated a little bit more of a surge back to growth via innovation, and that hasn't come to fruition probably as fast as we've seen in other markets. So that continues to be a challenge year over year. But in Turkey, Egypt, and India, those three regions are all growing and approaching double-digit growth for us. So they're very positive, and the team is doing a great job cultivating can growth and new customers there. But Saudi continues to be a very challenging environment for us and more importantly our customers.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, and then one just on Brazil, I guess bigger picture, your thoughts around underlying demand. I know there was a lot of volatility with the trucker strike and World Cup. But maybe just looking out in 2019, it seemed like the economy down there was on an improved trajectory. Do we still think about a, call it, 2% to 4% growth environment down there, or is there anything that's changed from that perspective?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think, and that 2% to 4% is probably like 6% to 8% on beer and probably continues to decline on CSD to get to that 2% to 4%, to give you more color. The can continues to win. The majority player in that market continues to push cans because all of their competition is going after them with cans. So from a can perspective, I feel bullish. Obviously, John's comment around the election, the uncertainty there, but from our business, in the can and the beer segment, things continue to look positive, and we're seeing continued investment by our customers in that region. So, I think your number is a pretty good one.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you, good luck.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Malika, we'll take one more question if there's any more.
Operator: Okay. And we do have a question from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes, good afternoon almost for us and good morning, Scott, Dan, and John. The question I have is on – I noticed that the equity income line, which is usually pretty material, $8 million – $10 million, was zero this quarter. Was there anything new there that we should take into account?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, it was exclusively the result of one-time mostly timing issues in one of our Asian JVs that will normalize going forward. The only delta for the full year will happen in the second quarter, nothing to be concerned about on an ongoing basis.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, so that was part of the one-time takeaways that made that go down?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then I think it was great the detail you gave us on some of the CapEx. I believe you said the Arizona project was $250 million. And maybe I'm just rusty on my recollection. And of course, there's a specialty component. But I thought a can plant was – you build the first line, it was probably under $100 million, and then the second line would be maybe $50 million or $70 million or something like that. Could you just help reconcile those two perceptions?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure. I think I also – this is Dan – I also referenced the Camarillas plant, two-line plant, $150 million. This is four-line plant. This is a four-line plant for $250 million.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, that is definitely very helpful.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: If you reference – if you go back to even – the Goodyear plant is more in line with what we would have done in Monterrey too, if you referenced some of that a couple years ago.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes, exactly. And that's still holding at three lines that are running pretty fully now.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, the last thing probably...
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Plus a significant end investment is the difference down in Monterrey.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I got you. And then looking back at Aerospace, you mentioned hiring a lot of people, and it should improve in the second half. Would you expect the EBIT margin to get back into that 10% – 11% range in the second half?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think 11% is probably a stretch, but certainly 9% to 10% is not unrealistic at all.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, thank you. Malika, are there any other questions?
Operator: Yes, sir, we do have two more questions in the queue. Would you like me to go ahead and introduce them?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Why don't we quickly go through them?
Operator: Okay, and our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ms. Jones, your line is open, please go ahead. Please check your mute function or pick up the handset. We are unable to hear you. Ms. Jones, we are still unable to hear you. We'll continue with the queue, a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Thanks. I know it's late and I feel bad coming in now. But the one-way glass volume growth that one of the obviously largest glass companies was talking about in Brazil, are you seeing that have much effect on industry can demand in Brazil? It didn't sound like that was the case given your prior comments. That was my follow-up question. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: George, I haven't – and I would just point to the fact it was such a disruptive quarter with the freight issues. We do continue to see the customers push cans and especially the major customer that does have returnable glass infrastructure. They're continuing to be forced into moving to cans because of retail outlets, et cetera. That's the best info I have right now.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you, Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: You bet.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, great. Thanks, Malika, and thank you, everyone, for participating. And again, as I mentioned, October 1 and 2 we're having our investor field trip out here in Colorado, so please be in touch with Ann Scott if you'd like to participate. And we look forward to seeing you all then. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will have a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, May 3, 2018. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you, Mladen, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job (sic) [Jobs] (00:47) Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluting earnings per share calculations. And joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and COO of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then, we'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business as well as our outlook for the company. Needless to say, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. Comparable operating earnings were up 26% year-over-year and comparable dilutive EPS were up 32%, as we continue to execute on our cost-out and value-in strategies in each of our businesses. Beverage cans continue to win with consumers, and our aerospace team has started to ramp up our new contracts. Our LTM comparable EBITDA through March 31, 2018 was $1.83 billion. And while we are well on our way to achieving both our EBITDA and free cash flow targets in 2018 and 2019, our first quarter results as a corporation were a bit ahead of even our own expectations. We continue to see good opportunities in front of us. And while our seasonally strong second and third quarters are ahead of us, the year is shaping up to be slightly better than expected. We are right on track with achieving our long-term financial goals. The sustainability and environmental profile of our products continues to resonate with global consumers. Metal packaging is winning versus other packaging substrates. Environmentally, studies have confirmed that aluminum packages have, by far, the highest global recycling rate of all beverage packaging substrates with more than 70% of all beverage cans recycled on a global basis versus less than 15% for plastic. We have an obligation to educate consumers that the plastic that is collected for recycling from private households and commercially is actually not being recycled. The vast majority of plastic packaging that consumers are putting into their curbside bins actually goes to the landfill. So, it's not just that a product is recyclable, it's about it's actually being recycled after it's collected. Helping the world understand the economic case for recycling aluminum and that certain products like plastic have low, and in some instances, no value at the end of their useful life is important. This is why our landfills are filling with plastic and our oceans are drowning in it. Aluminum has even higher economic value today and is easily and cost effectively collected, sorted and recycled. For example, one pound of aluminum can scrap from curbside collection in California at year-end 2017 was worth 7.4 times more than PET with glass actually having zero value. Generations young and old are being much more thoughtful about the impact of their purchasing decisions and the can is well positioned. Prior to our next quarterly earnings announcement, Ball will publish its biennial sustainability report and you'll have the opportunity to learn more about why the can is winning and how Ball is raising the bar on our environmental and social goals. Now, moving on to our results in the first quarter, we had a number of tailwinds as well as a few headwinds. Our South American business continued to deliver exceptional performance despite competitive pressures in Brazil. And our European business continued to progressively and sequentially improve on its performance, both of which Dan will get into later. Our North American business faced the first quarter anticipated headwinds from higher freight and distribution costs as well as startup costs related to our various new projects. In addition, lower volumes due to softness in megabeer continued to weigh on its potential. While we implemented certain disciplined decisions around standard 12-ounce business, CSD volumes were stronger than expected due to continued growth in specialty containers and growth in craft, sparkling water, import beer and other emerging categories also continued. Dan will discuss later why we continue to believe this segment will be up nicely for the balance of the year. Our footprint activities in both Spain and Arizona are on schedule. Global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 7% in the quarter and our tinplate food and aerosol businesses enjoyed improved operational efficiencies despite mid-single-digit volume declines. Our aerospace business continued to benefit from improved revenues due to our contracted backlog. And lastly, anticipated cost savings were realized in our G&A and sourcing that Scott will speak about later. While the declines in the U.S. domestic beer industry, soft volumes in EMEA due to devaluations in taxes and softer-than-anticipated tinplate food and aerosol volumes all are well known, the strength of our business and positive momentum across all of our product lines certainly offset these. And we remain confident that such issues will in no way impact our ability to achieve our near-term goals. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing our earnings through focusing on our product mix, price/cost, supply/demand and innovation management, generating higher free cash flow, reinvesting in EVA dollar value-creating growth projects that earn above 9% after-tax returns and returning significant value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To that point, last week our board approved a new 25 million share repurchase authorization. So, as they say, so far so good. And before turning it over to Dan, I want to clarify some questions about press articles related to a European Commission investigation on food cans. First, we do not manufacture nor sell food cans in Europe. And second, we have not been contacted by any European authorities nor have any of our facilities been visited. Given these facts, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on this as all of our information on this is from the same public sources as all of you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Our global beverage business operating earnings were up 13% year-over-year. Our team is incredibly busy executing on plans to maximize the value in each of our regions including the North America plant network optimization and European process transformation projects to further improve our cost structure and supply/demand balance in advance of upcoming contract renewals. Broadening our geographic footprint with mid-2018 plant startups outside Madrid, Spain, and in Goodyear, Arizona, specialty can line extensions in Argentina and Texas as well as a 2019 plant startup in Paraguay, aligning with the right customers and markets with expanding into new products and capabilities via our ever expanding offering on specialty can sizes. Leveraging our technical knowhow around predictive maintenance, light-weighting and process improvement, and positioning our products as the most sustainable in the world. I'm incredibly proud of our global teams. They're right on track with numerous growth projects, network optimization and cost-out efforts. The superior product protection that the can provides the beverage and its efficiency from a freight, distribution, warehousing and retail shelf perspective is vitally important. The economic value creation the can brings our customers is real and growing. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North America segment volumes were slightly below industry levels largely due to our disciplined value over volume approach to standard 12-ounce packaging in select U.S. locations and the key U.S. megabeer brand's underperformance. Ball's position with growing Mexican imports, craft, sparkling water and brands using specialty containers is very healthy. In short, cans continue to win share versus glass and other substrates. Anticipated plant network disruptions to install specialty capacity in existing plants, startup costs related to our new Goodyear plant and associated higher freight cost coupled with our disciplined decisions around volume were the reasons for a year-over-year decline in the quarter. These cost headwinds will abate as Goodyear comes online in late May and the network optimizations occur in the second half of the year. In other words, don't read too much into the first quarter for North America. We should see growth in operating earnings for the balance of the year. The team is performing at a very high level and the segment will benefit from fixed cost savings in late 2018 and beyond. We just need U.S. weather patterns to transition from winter nor'easters and spring blizzards to a nice sunny summer. Our South American business had a really nice quarter. Segment volume grew 10%, overall beer consumption and economic trends in Brazil improved and our customers continued to emphasize cans across South America. Given the growth outside of Brazil, the timetable for line expansions in Argentina has been accelerated and we continue to make preparations for the beverage can plant in Paraguay, which will come online in late 2019. In Brazil, our resulting value over volume response will likely lead to Ball's volume growing slower than the market rate during 2018. We continue to anticipate tougher year-over-year comps in the second half of our Brazilian business due to the profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract that supported the divestment business going away, challenging year-over-year volume comparisons and our value over volume response that played out in late 2017. It's great to see the Brazilian economy rebounding and we appreciate how effectively the team in South America is responding. The European business once again saw mid-single-digit volume growth led by Russia and Spain. Our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track with the plant likely starting up in late May, early June. Our near and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to where Ball's legacy business was are on track. And as a reminder, the cost savings from the German plant closure will anniversary in early August. Transformation projects are progressing nicely and will contribute to planned G&A savings in 2019. The European team has been dealing with some noise around recent Russian news headlines. And to make sure everyone is aligned, we have studied the sanctions and we do have the ability to source local metal as we have done in the past. So, it's business as usual. In EMEA, demand volatility remains. Egypt and Saudi have been particularly difficult due to economic dynamics and the carbonation tax versus seeing a better operating and demand environment in India. Our China business continues to be cash flow positive, and we will continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this market and prune larger chunks of capital when appropriate. In summary, we're executing on capital projects and our U.S. standard container supply/demand is tightening. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. You're doing a terrific job. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Comparable first quarter 2018 earnings were $0.50 versus $0.38 in 2017, a 32% improvement. First quarter diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across every product line and lower corporate costs, offset by higher taxes and a slightly higher interest expense. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Net debt ended the quarter at $7 billion, reflecting the normal seasonal working capital build in our business. For 2018, while it's only May, we feel good about where we're at and more importantly about where we're headed. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $900 million after spending at least $600 million with CapEx. Full-year 2018 interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $300 million, following the $750 million senior note issuance completed in March. Full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be approximately 24% based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform, and corporate undistributed should run under $110 million for full-year 2018. Keep in mind that the first quarter corporate undistributed was favorably impacted by lower pension expense and the FX impacts of hedges on intercompany loans which will be paid down throughout 2018, which will reduce the FX impact. As I have mentioned before, the corporate undistributable cost will move around as we progress on various transformation efforts. So, we'll give you an update as appropriate on these items. Cash flow is strong and we started buying back stock during the quarter. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased over 2.7 million shares or just north of $107 million. By year-end, we expect to buy at least $350 million of stock in addition to paying out roughly $150 million in dividends. We are at the cusp of returning significantly more value to shareholders in 2019 and beyond, and the team is really pleased that that time is here. Before I turn it back to John, we've had a number of questions on a new revenue recognition rules. For Ball, the impact for full year is expected to be nominal. And in the first quarter, the impact was less than $0.01 or $2 million of operating earnings of our $300 million, so not much to talk about. John?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved first quarter results driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. Our staffing levels continued to increase. And year-to-date, we have hired close to 300 new employees. The aerospace team has done an excellent job managing this large onboarding process from recruitment through retention without taking their eyes off the execution of our business. We continued to leverage our unique capabilities, world-class technology and the best talent in the industry to further grow our aerospace business in 2018 and beyond. Now, as we look forward for our corporation, we are on track to achieve our 2019 targets. And longer term, we believe that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunities in front of us right now. The strategic rationale of the beverage can acquisition are being realized, and we are truly leaning into our efforts to ensure that the world understands with great clarity that aluminum beverage cans are indeed the most sustainable package in the beverage world. Our aerospace business is very well positioned as technological shifts and resiliency play a more important role for our intelligent communities as well as our war fighters. Our aluminum aerosol business is well positioned for continued growth. And as Scott mentioned, we've begun to deliver on our promise to return significant amounts of capital back to our partners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And with that Mladen, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now have the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott and Dan.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Hey.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, John, I know you don't want to update synergies on the acquisition at this point, but you are 21 months into I think the 42 months' timeframe that you outlined in the long-term incentive plan around the acquisition and you had an $832 million EVA goal associated with that, if I have the numbers correct.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Could you maybe talk to us about where you are sort of halfway through that performance period around EVA generation?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think we're in good shape. We don't track EVAs and report it externally on a quarterly basis. But you can see in the year-end 2017 where we ended up and it was quite strong. In terms of synergies, as we said from the get go, we're really not going to talk specifically about synergies because we don't want to get into accounting discussion about what's a synergy and what's not a synergy. We just said focus on the EBITDA as a corporation. And we started at $1.53 billion at the mid-2016 and we said we were going to get to $2 billion by the end of 2019. And on an LTM basis, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at $1.83 billion. I think that just speaks for itself that we're right on that track of getting there.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And one quick follow-up on metals. I mean, Dan, thanks for the comments on Russia and obviously, North America and Europe. But it sounds like no way she's passing that through to the customers based on contractual obligations, but maybe that's misunderstood a little bit in the market. But the impact on working capital, how should we think about that in a rising metals environment and specifically since you're so focused on free cash flow?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, Scott, this is John. Let me first just reiterate home what you're talking about on the pass-through nature because the issue – we call for everyone, our business is a pass-through model. With the tariffs people have asked us many questions about it, but here in the U.S. over 90% of our metal volume is actually controlled by the customer with the remainder being a straight pass-through. In other parts of the world, we control the metal, but we never sign a contract without having a matched book, meaning the sales price is either linked to a floating aluminum price where the risk is borne by the customer or the metals hedged at the contracted price. We're not in the business of taking risk on aluminum, so all these changes in aluminum are truly a pass-through for us.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And on the working capital front, Scott, there shouldn't be much impact, because things that we're doing on the payable side will offset any of the increases on the receivable and inventory side.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And one last one on that, just for Dan. Given the rise in metal prices, are you seeing any signs from any of your customers that they're switching away from cans to potentially other alternatives? I mean, there's been a lot from your customers around using the can as their value driver, so I wouldn't think so. But just any thoughts around that would be appreciated. Thanks.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: No, I think you read that right. I mean, it's such a valuable piece of the economic equation, especially on the beer side that they're not going to move away. And historically, we've seen prices at this level and we didn't see any substrate change as a result of aluminum prices or raw material prices. So, we're not seeing that.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Scott, one last thing, remember in the first quarter, the industry in the United States was roughly flat. I think it was down three tenths of a point or something like that. Beer and megabeer is well known, that has been soft. But soft drink was actually up 2.5%. And so, I think that just further reinforces that prices will go up and down, but we have seen no demand destruction.
Operator: And our next question is from Tyler Langton, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. Just with South America, I think last quarter you were kind of looking for maybe, sort of 3% to 4% growth, I guess more so in Brazil. And obviously, it sort of did well this quarter. I mean is – do you think consumption in Brazil is going to be sort of better than your previous outlook or was the first quarter just a little bit stronger than expected? Just any details there would be helpful.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure. I can't really predict the back half of the year. But I would say, first quarter, peak season. And I think Brazil was roughly from a market standpoint in the 9% growth that was certainly a little bit ahead of where we thought it would be, heading into the year. We certainly benefited from that. I think a lot is going to play out here in the back half of the 2018 relative to – it won't be peak season, but relative to World Cup and I think also the presidential elections and heading into 2019, we'll be watching that, but we're certainly off to a really nice start and the teams performed really well. And then, other parts of South America are also trending ahead of where we thought and ahead of where even our customers thought. So, I think a lot of that has to do with the can versus substrate mix. And then also, as I said in my opening comments, the economic landscape in Brazil, I think, is a little better than even our customers thought at this point.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. And then, just so – just sticking with growth just with Europe. I think you mentioned volumes were up 6% on strength in Russia and the Iberian Peninsula, I mean is – just within Russia, I mean is that – I don't know if you can tell, yeah, from like the World Cup or if you can just kind of talk a little bit about what's driving those gains and sort of how sustainable you think they are?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think – well, first of all, our footprint is really strong in those two areas, so we benefited from the strength in those smaller regional aspects of Europe. Some of it is absolutely from World Cup pre-build, but there's also certainly a conscious movement away from plastic in that part of the world, Russia in particular. And we're benefiting from new can sizes and really the strength of our customers winning from a substrate standpoint in that particular area of the world.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question is from Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Scott, I wondered if you could just help us in the first quarter by giving us a sense of how large both the startup costs and the increased freight costs were.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think there are – if you look at the charge (24:16) from last year, it's really tied to those things at the volume. I mean, it's – there's not that much of a difference from last year. But we said going into the quarter, we'd have some headwinds from startup costs. But as Dan said, we expect to overcome those as we move through the year and improve performance throughout the rest of the year.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is it possible for you to kind of help us just cadence those startup costs as we move through the year, you're going to have Goodrich, you're going to have Spain?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, Goodyear should reduce as we get in the first quarter, we're already started making cans there, so that should come down, they come – should be operational here in May. And in Europe, more of that – more of the startup costs will hit the second quarter than in the first quarter.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, Dan, I wondered, you accelerated that Argentinean project, it sounds like maybe the market is shifting to kind of cans a little more rapidly than expected. Can you put a little color around that?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Sure. That's exactly what's happening. I think it's – there was a conscious effort by one of the key market players down in South America to push cans more aggressively against an incumbent returnable glass player and that has created some nice tailwinds in that marketplace. And it's continuing to build in terms of the can's penetration just from a overall substrate mix. And we're continuing to make incremental investments just to keep pace with the market. So, we'll – and we'll continue to do that as the can continues to win.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And what would that penetration rate be in a country like Argentina right now?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Right now, it's in the kind of somewhere in between the – north of 30%.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And that trends versus kind of high-single digits two and a half years ago.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: The next question is from Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: In the North American segment, is it possible to say how much volumes were down in the U.S. and maybe up in Mexico? And then, in terms of the value over volume approach, is it possible to quantify how much of a drag that was on volumes in 1Q? And if there's any way to think about if that's an appreciable drag on volumes for 2Q or maybe even the full year?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Let me – I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but let me give you some direction here. As an industry, the alcoholic segment, beer, was down almost 5% here in the United States. And given that we overweight to that, that's a fair kind of baseline from where you want to think about what we did on the beer side here in North America. In addition to that, as I said in my prepared remarks, soft drinks on the specialty side because of the launch of some rebranding of existing brands, as well as just growth on the specialty side, that specialty growth was quite nice, but we did purposely choose not to move forward with supplying some standard 12-ounce containers. So, overall in that, we were down just a little bit. And then, so we were down in North America, a little bit more than that 3%. But then, the Mexican imports offset that to get to the down 3%.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, Dan, you talked about upcoming contract renewals, for North America and Europe, is it possible to say what percentage of your sales or volumes is up for renewal in the next 12 months? Or is the percentage of your business that's up for renewal, is it significantly higher or lower than maybe a normal year or are there maybe legacy Rexam contracts that roll off? Can you give us any kind of color on the, I guess, the tenor of contract renewals?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I would say, on average, we're turning over contracts 15% to 25%, in our aggregate portfolio and there's really no significant variations to that.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Oh, hey. Good morning, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Hey.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: John, appreciate the comments about the European competitiveness investigation, I know it's early stages here. But should we just assume based on those comments that you view it as limited to the food can market at this point and no real impact on the beverage business there from what you can tell?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Absolutely.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, just as it relates to RussOil and Russia, I guess glad to hear no – it sounds like no disruptions to the supply chain. Is that – are there any changes to the timing of some of the sanctions that's driving that or any concerns that you might have some supply disruptions down the road or are you guys pretty confident that regardless of the outcome of all this, you'll be able to continue to process local aluminum?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Based on what we know today, we feel very confident that we won't have any disruptions in supply chain or impacts to the supply chain.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, could you just remind me about the currency there? Do you have a lot of ruble exposure either translational or transactional that we should be aware of?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah, it's most of that. We do have some ruble exposure, but it's really a dollar-based business. And then, it's invoiced in rubles, but we hedge – you can hedge some of that. So, there's really not that big of an impact.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Just one last one for me. Any way you can kind of quantify the dollar impact from freight and weather in the quarter?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Upper-single million dollars in North America.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Hey, Matt.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can you provide – hey. Can you provide some of the key elements to the year-over-year operating profit bridge for the North and Central America segment in terms of freight, startup costs, price/cost volumes or any other major factors that we should be aware of? Just trying to get a sense as to the bridge there.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. For the full year?
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, for the full year would be great.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Maybe I'll take a quick step and then I'll turn it over to Dan. But year-over-year, remember we had in the third quarter last year that we had the big hurricanes that was in excess of $30 million, that alone. And then, we've also said with the Goodyear project that in the second half of this year, and it's probably going to be more late third quarter or early fourth quarter. Nothing has changed in terms of our expectations there. But we're going to start to realize the beginnings of that net annualized $50 million of savings. So, those two things alone gets you kind of the upper 40s. And then, we have – really the – then, the plusses and minuses are the continued efficiencies that Dan talked about in terms of predictive maintenance and other things like that, the push on our specialty, the push on our value over volume, but – and then, the biggest unknown as we sit here right now is we're going into what is our strongest selling season in the summer, in the second quarter and third quarter. And so, that's to be seen. The weather has not been helpful to-date, as we all know. Dan referenced that. But as we get into the summer, I do think that can is winning. It's just a function of how our customers ultimately start to position their products. And we feel good, as I said before, on the CSD side there's some – been some tailwinds there. It's just the megabeer here in the United States has been a headwind.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add to those comments is that we talked quite a bit last year that we weren't as effective in the pre-build inventory. Heading into peak season last year we've made a conscious effort on the supply chain to manage that with our customers. So, if the sales show up, we should have a much more efficient supply chain cost to delivering those products.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. And then, maybe a question for Dan. Given that you've seen CSDs and other beverages experimenting with alternative can sizes, have you seen or do you expect to see similar dynamics develop with a number of your beer customers?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. That's a great question. I think, on one hand, you're seeing the traditional beer products and brands maybe not doing as well, so rest assured that our major megabeer customers are – they have a lot of queue of innovative products that they're leading with can, sleek cans, different channels. We're in those discussions. You've started to see some, I mean you could reference things like Michelob ULTRA, that was a conscious decision on how they branded that and that's done exceedingly well. But I would expect to see more and more of those things rolling out here over the next 18 months and we should – we should benefit from some of those discussions.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And it's not just the traditional beer, it's also SpikedSeltzers and other products like that that are extension, alcohol extensions from their core beer business.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Edlain Rodriguez, UBS. Go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, good morning. This is (34:10) for Edlain.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: In the food and aerosol business, do you believe we're done with the inventory restocking or destocking in food or is there more of that going on?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, that was – that was largely a first quarter because that carried over year-over-year because that's how the pricing works.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And then, regarding the value of a volume approach, how long do you expect to continue doing that or is that the long-term strategy there?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It's part of our long-term strategy.
Unknown Speaker: And then, last one on – you spoke considerably on the environmental concerns of plastic and why metal is favorable. Are you seeing that translate into direct – I guess the can taking away share from beverages that are typically in plastic and any products that you...
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well...
Unknown Speaker: (34:57)?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. As I said, CSD can – CSD here in the United States was up 2.5% in the first quarter. Dan mentioned in Europe that plastic has been on the hit list, not only in UK which is ground zero today, but even in Russia where they're banning larger-sizes PET. Dan also talked about the beverage can taking share from glass in the beer categories down, not only in Brazil, but also Argentina and other adjacent countries. So, those are just a couple of quick proof points of what we're doing. Based on our analysis, we believe as we sit here right now that the beverage can is the fastest-growing substrate in carbonation beverages. I separate still water because PET is still growing in there. But in carbonated beverages, both on the alcoholic and non-alcoholic side, the beverage – aluminum beverage can is the fastest-growing substrate in the world.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Hi, everyone. Thanks for all the details. I want to come back to the beer question. So, I've asked on custom can, so I've asked that for a while. Have you been surprised with the sort of longer tail in terms of some of these innovations showing up in can package in alcoholic beverages or is this what you'd – normally would have expected if you go back to two years ago when some of this was initially being trialed?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, maybe I'll take a first stab and then turn it over to Dan. Let's not forget that it's not just canned megabeer in the United States, it's all megabeer in the United States. And we look at the glass side as well and it's equally soft there. Their supply chains are built on longer-cycle issues, so it does take longer than we would like. But having said that, maybe I'll turn it over Dan, we have seen a lot of activity going on.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay...
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think George, the other thing just to keep in mind why I think you probably know this, but in the megabeer category in the U.S., you've also got vertically integrated assets from the two major players that they're going to leverage those as long as they can. And I think they're kind of waking up to – they need to be putting out new products that differ from the traditional beer category and they need to do it in different channels with different packages.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: And I recognize this is more of a comment and one that maybe you necessarily can't piggyback on. But again, I'm a little bit surprised that we haven't seen more only because the volume trend of mega has been negative for a long time. And the example that you've seen in sparkling beverages that are non-alcoholic in terms of stimulating growth from non-traditional packaging is pretty apparent. So, anyway, but you're saying it's on the calm. And when will you start to see more of that in your volume, do you think? You said 18, 24 months, but that's a long time. Is that something that shows up this year or is it really more of a 2019 and 2020 phenomenon?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. There will definitely be stuff that comes out this summer. Then, the million-dollar question is at the magnitude of how does the end consumer believe in that product and purchase that product will be whether or not we have a significant volume lift or not.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Turning to Europe, the performance was – it sounds like from your expectation, may be a bit better than expected. You obviously had strong volume growth. On the cost side, can you give us some view in terms of how costs – the program that you've had underway performed over the course of the quarter? Was it a little bit ahead of your expectation? I'm not asking for mark-to-market on synergies. But if it was better than expected, what was driving that? And then, I seem to remember there was a comment about SG&A reductions being more or less completed by 2019. I just wanted to confirm that's what you said and obviously as part of the Rexam program.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think Europe, on the cost side, is doing a very good job. They've had a multi-year program to get cost out and they're tracking to that. There's more things to do. But they've had success. They're also benefiting from some other synergies. The original synergies that we baked into the deals. So, I would say, they're performing pretty well.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, Dan?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I would just say just on the operational side, one of the things that we've been really pleased with via the acquisition has been kind of the lean mentality that we acquired in really from the Rexam operational folks. And I think we've got two to three new Shingo certified facilities over there. We're installing new supply chain software that's helping us kind of manage our freight and our supply chain better. And then, the lean programs are slightly ahead. I mean, this is not – each of those aren't significant. But all of them added together, they're – I think like to Scott's point, Europe is really doing a nice job across the board on working all these efficiency programs.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And George, on the SG&A, as we've done in 2019, I don't think we'll be done. I think we'll have completed a lot of what we wanted to do. But as you go through these things, you always find new opportunities, so they'll be more after 2019.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I agree. Nothing has changed, said it another way in that, George, nothing has changed on our expectations about as we continue to drive SG&A. We are benefiting a little bit from pension this year and a couple of other little things. But we're also in the midst of transitioning to this global shared service concept and nothing has changed relative to what we've spoken about in the past.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: And maybe one last one here and I'll turn it over. And I recognize Europe is a more seasonally peaked region than even North America, but – and it's only the first quarter. Is Europe, at this juncture, tracking better than you would have expected back in February when you last gave guidance? And then, my last question, sorry about that, just can you remind us what kind of cash outlays might you entail or put out for the Rexam integration this year? Thank you, guys. Good luck on the quarter.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, the – for Europe, I would say, George, that we saw some favorable mix just because of our regional positioning and footprint. So, those benefits, I'm not entirely sure they'll continue for the balance of the year, I think more. We expect to be kind of in line with where we thought for Europe. But certainly, the significantly or improved performance in Russia coming out of the gate was a little better than we anticipated.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And for the cash outlays on the Rexam integration there, we're not really looking at it that way, George. This is one integrated business now. So, we're going to spend north of $600 million in CapEx. We've got some severance things that are going to get paid for some of the closures that we've already announced – or disclosure that we announced in Europe. This is one business now. We're not looking at that as synergy capture, spending like that. It's just it's Ball.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. And congratulations to a strong start to the year.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I wanted to ask you a question here. Look, you talked about in your press release 40% of your mix now as specialty can. Could you maybe give us a sense as to how that is different by geographies? And as you think about – I think you've long talked about doing better with some of the specialty products in the margin or profitability versus others. And you also referenced some contract negotiations and things that will be upcoming. Is that something you think could continue or do you anticipate perhaps some convergence there? Or how might we think about that in relation to the mix and stuff as well?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. This is John. Why don't I take the first part of it? And then, Dan can talk about it because I think it's core – this whole push of specialty is a core part of our strategy and that you have to understand that. So, it flows through everything we're doing from contract renegotiations to our footprint to the supply chain optimization Dan was talking about. When you go by region, when you think about it, North America, it's in the mid to upper 30s. It was a little bit less in the first quarter. But don't read into that too much because it's such a seasonally slow. But generally speaking, in North America, it's kind of upper 30s and it's growing quite nicely off a big base. Europe is about the same. And we think we probably have little bit more incremental opportunity because a lot of our specialty in Europe is with a very important energy drink customer. And we think the other parts of the market have greater ability. South America is probably right around 50%, and we've seen a lot of growth there. Argentina isn't nearly as far along with that and the other countries outside of Brazil. But I think they're catching up quickly, so the growth of that is moving very quickly. And then, you go into places in like China which it's probably close to 10%, but it's growing quite quickly. And then, you go to EMEA where it's 75-plus percent. So, in total, it's in that range of approximately 40%. And we think – the question we often get asked is do you think you can get to 50%. And the short answer is yes, we do. It's just a function of time. And that function of time is partially dependent, as Dan said, on some of these new products and the receptivity of these new products and the push by our customers. But rest assured, this is core part and parcel of our strategy.
Operator: And our next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: (44:57).
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Dan, just one question on Brazil. I think you mentioned the market was up about 9%. And presumably that's a function of consumption growing and cans taking share. What I'm a bit just confused by is one of your glass competitors was up 30% in Brazil, and they said they were up 35% in beer. So, it doesn't seem obvious that they're losing share to can. So, can you just kind of help me understand what you think is going on from a market share perspective there, what you think actual beer consumption was up in the quarter and then what your expectations for the Brazilian bev can market are relative – for the year, relative to the 9% up in 1Q?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Actual beer consumption was slightly down, so that's probably not going to help your calculation there if you reverse engineering this.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: But the problem with – the problem with returnable glass is, I mean are they restocking inventory? I mean that ultimate – I can't answer that question, I don't know what that is. For us, it's all incremental sales. And from what we've seen, this is not just on the megabeer or the big players in the market. There's an awful lot of craft beer now. There's an awful lot of 100% – or different European malt-based products. All of those are coming in 100% cans, and they're taking share and they're taking share from glass. I think that's where the genesis of my comments are coming from. I can't comment though, Adam, on the returnable glass mix or the restocking of inventory or the breakage or any of that in the supply chain for some of the beer folks.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, if consumption was slightly down, it doesn't sound like the economy is recovering that robust at least based on that. I mean would you think otherwise or – I'm just trying to make sense of that because everyone's talking about the improving economy, but that wouldn't seem supportive of that notion.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, yeah, it is an improving economy, but it's not a healthy economy. The GDP 18 months ago was down 3%, 4%. And now, it's flat. Flat's a heck of a lot better than down 3% or 4%, but it's not like it's growing 3% or 4%. So, you got to think of it in those terms.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just one last one on Brazil, John or Dan. Just – so, if the bev can market was up 9% in the quarter, any rough expectations for the year compared to that 9% in 1Q?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think Dan alluded to it earlier. It's – we're entering now a seasonally slow period. And the visibility towards the second half – in the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter, that is the further you go out in these more emerging and developing economies, more difficult it is, and that's our only hesitation. We continue to think that can is going to do very well. But the – we have the elections coming up in the fall in Brazil, and that will play an important part to the overall economic mood of the country.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sure. Thanks. And just one on the value over volume approach that you mentioned earlier. I don't think you've been quite as explicit about this on previous calls. So, can you just kind of help me with any kind of change in approach or at least why you're speaking more explicitly about this than you have on previous occasions in the U.S. obviously?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Well, it's specific to Q1 results year-over-year for North America, why we're down 3% versus the market being flat, that was a callout that was required for this call.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. But, Adam, I think ever since we've closed on the acquisition, we've talked about value over volume. And I remember talking about it isn't just price. It's about tighter order call-offs. It's about helping our customers becoming more efficient using cans on their line. It's about mix. The 12-ounce is very competitive. And where we compete with others, we're trying to be a leader. But you got to be realistic in terms of your customer alternatives. And what we've tried to do over the past couple of years and continue to do is actually help our customers expand their profit pool in their products, so that they can win. Whether it's better graphics on the craft beer segment, different can sizes that we talked about, the CSD, new can formats, sparkling water, energy drink or even on the beer side that we talked 10 minutes ago and bottles play a part of that. If we can help our customers grow their profit pools, it will help us also.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, John.
Operator: And next question is from Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes. And good morning. Thanks for all the details this morning. First question has to do with the very small but volatile business that we can sort of back into which is EMEA. And it looked like it had really fallen off a lot in the first quarter. Should we expect the next – I get to $3 million in EBIT. Should it stay in that ballpark for any or – or change much for the rest of the year quarterly?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I would say, from a year-over-year standpoint you'll have a more normal pattern in Q2. As you may recall and we mentioned this last year, the Saudi carbonation tax took place in Q2 of last year. And so, that hurdle continued all the way through Q1. But we will see a normalized pattern in the back half of the year. We saw a little bit weaker volumes in Egypt versus our expectations like coming out of the gate. But those are trending back to more in line with our expectations and our guidance. So, I mean it's still a tough market. The macro environment's not great there and the carbonation taxes obviously have increased the price, the end consumer. But we still like that region. It's profitable. And we think over the next two to three years, we'll return back to kind of a more normal demand profile versus what we acquired.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And looking at the South American segment, you mentioned some of the volume shifts that will make the second half comps a lot tougher. And when we look at, again, the income that you expect from that region, whether its EBIT or EBITDA, do you think that that will still be above on a year-over-year basis in the second half? I just want to get a view of sort of how much compression you see after what was obviously a really great first quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, that's right. Remember that we said on the last conference call, we expected it to be down year-over-year. We did have a first quarter that was much stronger. We expected it to be strong. Not as strong as it was, so it exceeded our expectations. But again, the greatest uncertainty we have is the second half of the year. As we go into the second quarter, it's going to slow down. We had a strong second quarter in South America last year, so relatively flattish is probably what we expect right now. But it's really the second half of the year which we don't have enough visibility into because, as Dan mentioned, the World Cup which is an off-season event down there, that could be a plus or a minus depending on who's in – how far do the South American teams go in it. And then, we've got this election coming up. And as we all know, when you have elections, in Brazil in particular, the government spending that happens before and after, it'd play a meaningful impact to the overall economic health.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And we also have the benefit of the INS deal from the sale of the business in the first half of the year that goes away in the second half.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, just a last one. As we're thinking about the free cash flow, both this year and next year, Scott, can you just update us as to where we expect the net working capital either source or investment to be in that calculation?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, there's still a bit of a benefit this year that we'll experience to get to the $900 million. We're going to spend more capital this year. And then, in 2019, I think we'll probably spend less capital because we got a couple big projects that we're doing that will end this year. And we expect a nice pop in earnings. And so, it's really too early to call how much working capital will be part of that $1 billion of free cash flow in 2019.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just curious about the competitive landscape. There's been some issues with the volumes, I guess, in developed markets. Are you guys seeing any issues with customer behavior as far as raising prices – or I mean, not raising prices, but pushback against prices that you're charging for metal? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, remember metal is a complete pass-through, and so that we don't really control that metal. And so, every customer is different. Some have hedged long term, some have done it at the spot rate and everything in between. So, I don't think, number one, we can generalize anything. And number two, all I can tell you is that really that is we work with our customers to optimize that. But the metal fluctuations both positive and negative, when they occur, accrued to the benefit or detriment of the customer.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. I didn't really characterize it correctly. I meant more on the conversion side, I guess, is – there've been any pushback as far as you increase your penetration in specialty that rates are going down or changing in mix, i.e., non-12 ounce commanding any difference on premium?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, nothing has changed from what we've talked about in the past. As I mentioned earlier though, it is what we're trying to do is actually help our customers margin up their business by using specialty. And I think relaunch of a certain soft drink in the first quarter this year is a great proof point to that. When you look at the average retail selling price of the cans that they're using now versus the cans they're using before, it's been a great benefit to them.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then, lastly as a follow-up, maybe you can just comment on category growth in non-beer, water, tea, specialty areas, energy drinks and so on, have those kind of remained relatively robust or any changes you've noticed in those categories? Thanks.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: No fundamental changes. Obviously, the star in the group is the sparkling water category. I think tea is this kind of a nominal growth opportunity. You see most of that through the peak season in the summer months. But craft beer, really good growth, continues in that 20% to 30% range and that's mostly a substrate penetration. But also end consumers shifting their preference to that. But yeah, we haven't seen any changes to the very positive trends in those categories, and we're still bullish on those for the foreseeable future.
Operator: And we have a follow up question from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple different things. One, I think, actually what part of what I was trying to get at is you addressed the changes in mix for specialty. But thoughts about potential profitability, each of those converging through time. Could you maybe go back and address that as well?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Please – I'm not sure I follow. Can you please elaborate a little bit more?
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, sure. I mean I think historically you guys have talked about the specialty cans having better profitability or conversion margin or what have you than do more standard cans and the thoughts that through time is if that becomes a bigger piece that potentially converging?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, the short answer is no. We've seen nothing and we don't necessarily expect for the reasons I said before. We're helping our customers grow. One of the things that we need to do a better job of, it makes it – we make it sound like there's two cans, there's just a standard can and there's specialty can. We make over 32 different sizes here in North America alone. Each one of those has a different contribution margin profile having to do with volume, having to do with line loading, having to do with a whole host of things that partially are in our control about how we leverage our footprint and the ability to make multiple sizes, in multiple locations, in multiple geographies, combine that with the volume demand that we have from customers both on a regional and national basis. You put all that together and it does create more complexity in our system. And given that we have a footprint that we can line load that much more effectively than we believe anyone else can, we're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to push for another 32 different can sizes if it helps our customers grow their profitability. So, yes, you will always see compression as volume grows and you have more competition in any given size. But when you're making over 30 different sizes, it's a very difficult question to answer.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. You did a good job. Thank you. The second question, I wanted to switch gears a second and come back to the earlier comments regarding recycling and the value proposition of a can versus glass or versus plastic. Have you seen or have had discussions with customers in particular regarding their change of preference for filling capacity, meaning that they're investing more in filling capacity for cans or specifically even abandoning or disinvesting in filling capacity for other substrates?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: In – for example, in the United States and Europe, we really haven't. In the United States, we have not. There is excess filling capacity for all types of products here in the United States. In Europe, yes, we do have it, but at a small level. But to Dan's point, down in South America, off the top of my head, I can think of four or five new can filling lines going in some of these regions that we've been experiencing very strong growth. So, we have seen a – I don't know if you want to call it a shift, but the incremental investment from the filling side has been going in the can.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, last question I had, on the aerospace side, look terrific growth in the backlog. It wasn't that long ago that it was well under $1 billion. How do we see that beginning to monetize over the next couple years? So, how should we think about both revenue growth and profitability growth in that segment?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, I think, number one, profits will follow revenue. So, I wouldn't expect any material margin expansion or contraction. And I think this past quarter was a good representative. I think the margins were relatively same. On the revenue line, we grew double digits, low-double digits, I think. I think that's a good way to be thinking about it. One of the things that gives us confidence is that's a long-cycle business, so the visibility we have into that literally we can go up three, four, sometimes even five years and look at the visibility. Our won, not booked which is those projects that we have won but we have not booked in the backlog because they haven't been funded yet is at record highs as well. And that's what gives us comfort. As we – that – as those programs get funded and move into our contracted backlog, that's going to extend out this growth pattern that we see.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And gentlemen, those are all the questions we have.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Terrific. Well, we appreciate all the help here and we appreciate all the questions. We look forward to speaking to you at the end of our second quarter. And as a reminder, we are going to have a Investor Day out here in Colorado in the very beginning of October. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Ann Scott on that. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call for today. We thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a great rest of your day. And you may disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 7, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO for Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, Nelson, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially for those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company’s news release. If you don’t already have our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release -- release, it’s available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today’s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now, joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and COO of our Global Beverage business. I’ll provide some brief introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss the key financial metrics, and then I’ll finish up with comments on our Food and Aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for 2018. We were very pleased with our strong fourth quarter comparable operating earnings and free cash flow. Each of our public reporting segments were up year-over-year from an earnings perspective and much of the hard work in terms of cost out and value in and for each of our businesses continued to show up. While we are pleased with this performance, we are not surprised. Since the closing of the acquisition, there have been questions and opinions regarding our ability to hit our 2017 and 2019 comparable EBITDA and free cash flow targets. When we closed on the acquisition of Rexam 18 months ago, we had a pro forma comparable EBITDA of just over $1.5 billion and laid out a 3.5-year plan to increase that by the end of 2019 to $2 billion, while generating free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. We also said that we expect it to generate in 2017 comparable EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, free cash flow in excess of $750 million. Along the way, we knew that there would be ups and downs, but we're confident and had conviction that these targets were achievable. Nothing has changed in our view. In the 18 months since then, we indeed have had our ups and downs, in the ups column, we have met or exceeded our initial synergies in terms of G&A, sourcing and footprint activities. We have had exceptional performance from our South American business, continued improvement from our European business, greater stability in terms of North America CST volumes, continued strong growth in craft, sparkling water and other emerging categories, and strong growth in Central America, particularly in Mexico. We've had good aluminum aerosol growth and continued strong performance from our aerospace business. In the downs column, we have had and continue to face headwinds in terms of domestic U.S. beer consumption, difficult manufacturing performance in our food and aerosol business in the first half of 2017, that is now behind us. Challenging food industry dynamics, supply disruptions in North American beverage due to the hurricanes last fall, volatile volumes in our EMEA beverage can business driven by governmental regulation, carbonation tax and economic disruptions and continued pricing pressures in China. However, because and in spite of all of these, we achieved or exceeded our 2017 targets. Our long-term strategy is intact. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing our earnings through a mix of volume, price, cost and supply demand and innovation management, generating higher free cash flow, reinvesting in EVA dollar value creating growth projects and returning excess free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, as we look back over the fourth quarter 2017, several highlights include; the beverage can continue to win versus other substrates across the globe. Depending on geography and on beverage segment, this is due in part to the economic value creation of the can to our customers and their consumers. It’s recycling and sustainable attributes relative to other substrates. The superior product protection that the can provides the beverage itself, and the overall efficiency the can provides from our freight distribution warehousing and retail shelf perspective. We continue to believe that the can has much further runway to capture a greater share of the packaging mix. Dan Fisher will amplify that a bit more later. In addition to lowering our G&A cost structure and achieving sourcing savings, we recognize cost savings from the beverage can, plant network optimizations in North America and Europe. We continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies in our tinplate businesses, and saw a slight pull forward of certain food can shipments in the fourth quarter in advance of anticipated raw material hikes and we achieved record contracted backlog of $1.75 billion in our aerospace business. Going into 2018, it's on us to execute on our existing plans to maximize the value of each of our businesses, broadening our geographic footprint, aligning with the right customers and markets, expanding into new products and capabilities, leveraging our technical knowhow and positioning our products is the most sustainable in the segments in which we operate. Key areas of emphasis for us will be the successful startups of our Goodyear, Arizona and Madrid, Spain beverage can facilities, effectively managing our various beverage can footprint initiatives, positioning the can as the most sustainable package in the world in which we live, successfully managing the growth and investment in our aerospace business, profitably growing our aluminum aerosol businesses and improving the probability of our food can and China beverage can businesses. Thanks to all of our 18,000 plus employees, who helped the company achieve these results with numerous customer awards and once again being recognized as an industry leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and on the Corporate Equality Index. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel Fisher: Thanks, John. As we begin 2018, our global beverage businesses are poised to execute on numerous growth projects, network optimizations and product launches. Our global beverage can volumes grew nearly 2% in 2017 and almost 2.5% in the fourth quarter led by South America, Europe and our specialty portfolio. The beverage can is the most environmentally sustainable and capable package in our customer's line up and you will continue to hear us from all of these qualities to consumers and customers like. John referenced the disciplined growth investments and efficiency activities going on across each of our regional segments. Project teams are aligned on budget and on schedule. Moving to the individual segments. Though much gets said about continued pressure on domestic mass beer declines, Ball’s North American segment volumes were flat versus the industry, which was down slightly and this is largely due to continued growth in Mexican imports, craft, sparkling water, and brands using specialty containers to promote their products. And let's not forget that Ball is well-positioned with the two fastest growing segments of the U.S. beer industry, which are Mexican imports and craft and that the beverage can continues to win versus other substrates. In 2017, cans picked up another 1.5% of share from glass. The North American team did a great job in the fourth quarter and they recorded good financial results despite the lingering effect of higher freight rates. In advance of our second half 2018 planned network optimization, where will we add no new net capacity and tightened 12-ounce supply demand, we will be contemplating line speed ups and other efficiency programs that remaining facilities across the network. With this in mind, our first quarter utilization rates will likely be lower than fourth quarter. We have a busy and exciting year in North America and the team is much more on its toes as we position ourselves for additional fixed cost savings in 2018 and beyond. Our South American business had a really nice quarter. Segment volume grew mid-teens versus mid-teens declined in fourth quarter 2016. In addition to better weather, the overall bill beer consumption trends in Brazil stabilized and our customers further emphasized cans over glass across South America. With cans growing its share of the beer segment from 43% to 45% in Brazil and even higher package share gains in other surrounding countries. To further support beverage can growth in countries surrounding Brazil and having a multi-year contract in place, we’re building a beverage can plant in Paraguay to serve its needs as well as continued growth in Argentina and Bolivia. In Brazil, our resulting discipline response to competitive behavior will likely lead to Ball's volume growing slower than the market rate during 2018. Despite this comment, year-to-date demand trends have remained quite favorable in advance of Carnival, and I would expect will remain strong through World Cup. I do anticipate tougher year-over-year comps in the second half for our Brazil business, due to the profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract, that supported the divestment business. Going away and challenging year-over-year volume comparisons. The European business once again saw mid-single-digit volume growth led by Russia and Spain, our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track with the plant likely starting up late May, early June, which is a bit ahead of schedule. Our near-term and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to where Ball's legacy business was are on track and the cost savings from the German plant closure will anniversary in early August. The ongoing finance transformation projects will largely be complete by year end 2018, which will contribute to planned G&A savings in 2019. The European team finished the year strong both from a free cash flow and earnings perspective and I'm sure everyone is looking forward to World Cup being held in Russia, where we have a nice presence and an outstanding regional team. In EMEA, demand volatility remains with full year volume down mid-teens yet, the team continues to do a great job dealing with the complexity. As we look forward in the region, we are lowering our cost structure and helping certain governments understand how legacy laws on their books are stifling job growth, and impeding environmentally friendly, packaging growth. Our China business continues to be cash flow positive and we will continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this market and prudent larger chunks of capital when appropriate. In summary, our global beverage business posted strong results to close the year. We have a feeling of momentum across most of our regional businesses. We know what we need to do in 2018 and our multi-year thesis for acquiring Wrexham and deploying growth capital remains intact. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dan. Comparable fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $0.60 versus $0.44 in 2016, a 36% improvement. And full year 2017 comparable earnings per diluted share improved 17% from a $1.74 in 2016 to $2.04 in 2017. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across every segment and lower corporate costs. Full year results were driven by strong operating results in our largest global beverage businesses and our aerospace business, offset by slightly lower Food and Aerosol segment performance and higher year-over-year interest expense. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will be provided in our 10-K. Net debt ended the year at $6.5 billion, which was right on top of our expectation after $200 million of pension funding and returning over $200 million to shareholders and despite $275 million of unfavorable FX impact on foreign-denominated debt. We exceeded our free cash flow goal for 2017 coming in at $922 million after spending $556 million of CapEx. Activities to squeeze working capital out of the balance sheet were incredibly successful and a team effort across all our businesses. As we think about 2018, we expect full year 2018 comparable EBITDA to be pretty much a straight line straight-line into our 2019 goal of $2 billion of EBITDA. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $900 million after spending at least $600 million of CapEx, reporting the completion of the Goodyear with Madrid and Paraguay plans as well as the Aerospace expansion. Full year 2018 interest expense will be in the range of $295 million. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 23%, we saw on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform. And corporate undistributed will be in the range of $115 million for full year 2018. The cash is showing up, so in addition to our ongoing quarterly cash dividends, we’re planning for our share buyback to step up as well. Our initial estimates are for $350 million of share buybacks in 2018, largely but not exclusively in the second half of the year, given the timing of our season seasonal working capital bill. We feel good about where we are, and at this early stage in the year, we look forward to returning even more value to shareholders in 2019 and beyond. And with that, I’ll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported an improved fourth quarter results driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. We’ve been saying that the Ball Aerospace team was winning new work, and it now has translated into contracted backlog. Our staffing levels will continue to increase in 2018 as we ramp-up on these key wins. The Aerospace team has done a wonderful job leveraging the capabilities of our customer focus, world-class technology and knowhow in talent and year-over-year profitable earnings growth which will extend beyond 2018. Now, as we look forward for our corporation, as mentioned previously, we’re on track to achieve our 2019 targets largely through the stated synergy benefits from the transaction, continued growth of our beverage can, improved performance from the food and aerosol business, and the ramp up of new business in aerospace. From a synergy perspective, recall that we had a three and a half year plan to realize $300 million of net synergies. Phase 1 and 2 of synergy capture would be in the form of G&A office reduction in sourcing synergies, which would come within the first 18 month of the closing of the acquisition. We are currently at or above our targets in both of these phases and still have more synergy opportunities that we should realize on the sourcing side in 2018, as well as realizing our shared services, G&A efficiencies in late 2018 and 2019. Phase 3 is our footprint work, which would come in years one through three following the closure of the acquisition. We have already closed the Recklinghausen, Germany and Reidsville, North Carolina facilities and have announced three plant closures in the U.S. We were also building new plants in Arizona, Spain, Powerglide in our joint venture in Panama and are installing new lines in several other plants, including Texas and Mexico. Once realized we should be above our goals with this phase. Phase 4 is to leverage any commercial benefits from the transaction, including but not limited to providing our customers anything, anywhere, anytime with respect to product, service, innovation and other discriminators. We did not count on any synergies in these – in this area and if we are able to realize some we said it would be in the backend and beyond to the three and one-half year planning period. We are delivering on our commitments and see a path to further growth beyond 2019, as our newly deployed and 2018 growth capital hits its stride. And with that, Nelson, were ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.
Mehul Dalia: All right. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
John Hayes: Good, thanks. How are you?
Mehul Dalia: First question on EBITDA. I guess, your EBITDA comments imply a $1.6 billion in EBITDA for 2018. Is that right? And how should we think about the cadence on a quarterly basis, just given there's a lot of moving parts with plant additions and shuddering throughout the year?
Scott Morrison: No. I don’t think the number you're referencing is right. I would take in the back of the earnings release, I think it rolls up to $1.752 billion. I take that and add $2 billion and divide by 2, that’s kind of get you where I was referring to.
John Hayes: Yeah. Said another way, we finished the year about $1.75 billion. We said by 2019, we'd hit $2 billion. So, split the difference between to that and that's a good guidepost for 2018. I think as we said in the first half of 2018, we actually have some good momentum going into it. When we go through, there is going to be some ups and downs, but we continue to expect continued improvement in each of the quarters. I think, as we get to the second half of the year with the fall, with no longer providing the ends as we talked about in South America, that will be a little bit of a headwind in South America. But at the same time, if we execute correctly, we'll be ramping up on some of our cost out initiatives in North America as well as continuing our cost out initiatives in Europe. And so, remember, its February right now, so I think it’s premature to give any additional guidance, but that’s what we see as we sit here right now.
Mehul Dalia: Okay. Great. Yeah. And sorry, I did the calculation wrong, but that makes sense. And just one follow-on, can you – do you have your expectations for Brazilian growth in 2018? How much lower do you expect that to be for you guys on a relative basis?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. Well, I don't expect it to be lower, I expect it to be higher on a year-over-year basis. I think we will – with the new market entrants that we gave guidance on in our last earnings call, I expect all the participants to have a slower growth profile than the overall growth in the marketplace.
John Hayes: Yeah. The Brazilian, in particular, but also surrounding countries, the growth in that was quite strong. We mentioned in South America, we had 13% to 15% growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year, it was close to -- just under 10%. We don't expect that to continue, but I do think in the first half of the year with the World Cup coming up, we'll continue to see some strength but in the second half of the year we're going to be facing some very difficult comps. And I think as Dan alluded to with a new competitor in there, we expect to be growing at a rate lower than the overall market for 2018.
Mehul Dalia: Sorry, I guess my question wasn't clear. I think that's what I was trying to ask. So how much lower do you expect it to be versus the market in 2018?
John Hayes: It's premature to tell. What I would say is probably a couple of points, three to four percent points lower than the overall growth of the market, but that's just a guess because here's the reality, we have a new competitor coming on, they're adding a couple of new lines into that market, which is about a $1.5 billion. We understand that they are in the process of ramping up and we understand that's largely contracted. Much of that business was able to -- came out of Ball’s business but we still see overall growth well on access of that, so we're going to see some growth in our business just not as great because we face that headwind.
Daniel Fisher: The other signal to the point is to go back to the last World Cup, there will be a winner and a loser from a retail presence and a customer. We don't know who that's going to be at this point and that could -- that makes answering that question a lot harder given the year and the events that are going to take place.
Mehul Dalia: Makes sense. Thank you so much.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tyler Langton: Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on the free cash flow guide for 2018. Scott, give us a sense I guess how much working capital is baked into that $900 million number?
Scott Morrison: I think we really overachieved in '17 on getting a lot of the working capital out, so I still expect the benefit in 2018, but it's probably more like a $100 million in '18.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Thanks. And then, just South America is down. I don't know if you can give any -- I know the third-party sales of ends are benefiting. Can you give a sense of like how much I guess they benefited 4Q results and sort of what do you expect for 2018?
John Hayes: We were -- what we’re trying to say it's tough to parse out because we've had that since the close of the acquisition. What we're saying is as part of the divestiture, the company we sold it to is going to be building their own capacity that we expect that to be coming online sometime in mid-2018. So, we've actually been selling them in mid-2016 through mid-2018, in the second half of 2018, we won't be selling those ends.
Tyler Langton: Okay. And then, just final question on CapEx, and I know it's going to be a little bit higher in '18 is $500 million is still sort of depending on projects, a good run-rate kind of through 2018 and beyond?
Scott Morrison: No. We said in '18, we’ll probably spend a little over $600 million -- in the range of $600 million, because we’ve got the big projects are good year, finishing up spending, getting that up and running, some specialty investments and then all the aerospace capital that we’re spending for their facilities.
John Hayes: Yeah. And we also announced yesterday a new -- yeah, a new Paraguay facility.
Tyler Langton: And also, if I may, post-2018 like 2019 beyond is $500 million sort of a…
Scott Morrison: Yeah, I think that’s a good proxy. It depends on growth, right. And if it grows and we continue to find places to deploy capital, we’ll do that. If it's a little bit slower, we’ll probably dial it back. These are some pretty big chunks. So, I would expect it to come down in '19.
Tyler Langton: Got you. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. I had a couple of questions on Europe. I think in your last Q, you discussed pockets of negative pricing in bev cans, obviously had a very strong 4Q. I don’t know if it’s abated or to the extent you can if you can talk generally about price cost in the region? And then, can you remind us in terms of World Cup, typically how that helped your volumes and the timing of that – of that bump in Europe and maybe the host country?
John Hayes: Yeah. Why don’t I take your first one and I’ll turn it over to Dan. First, in terms of your question, we inherited some comment – contracts that had year-over-year price increases as we went into the 2017. As we go into 2018, we still have a little bit of it, although it’s a little bit less of a headwind and then those contracts expire. And so, we still feel some of the effects of it. But I think overall in terms of the overall market tone it’s a relatively flat market right now, in terms of the price cost mix. In terms of your quite second question about the World Cup is, as we’ve alluded to in our prepared remarks, it’s in Russia where we have a very good presence and a very good team. What we have found is always World Cup – always adds some benefit, but quite candidly it depends upon what geographies and which regions are doing well in the World Cup. If South America does well, it’ll benefit that, if a European team does well, it will benefit that, and unfortunately, I wish I could say if an American team did okay, but other than Mexico, I’m not sure that’s the case. So, Dan, do you have anything up to add?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. Just one clarifying comment. I think, John said price increase it was obviously, a price decrease on those contracts that we inherited. So that wasn’t in the negotiating context that was just being inherited and what was built into those. And then the other point specific to World Cup is if the World Cup’s happening in a region, where it’s already peak season you’ll have a negligible increase. So, to John’s comments if you’re in an off-peak season in a place like Brazil, the World Cup can stimulate growth in that area. So, I wouldn’t necessarily read into Europe’s going to have a significant benefit given the timing of when that happens in it relative to the peak season.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then just switching to North America, quick question, freight and weather was a big concern in 3Q, is it possible to say how much of an impact higher freight costs had in 4Q? And kind of as you said today, would you say those costs have kind of mostly normalized or how do you think about freight in North America?
Scott Morrison: Well, I would say that the freight rates have definitely increased, what we experienced in the third quarter was disruption because of the weather patterns and with that you get expedited freight rates as opposed to just a natural rate increase. The natural rate increase is probably in the area of $5 million to $7 million in a quarter in North America, and we’re experiencing that right now in Q1, and we don’t see that dissipating until fuel prices or oil prices come down.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s helpful. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning. Some questions on U.S., like how much was volume down in the U.S. from for Big Beer? And two, do you continue to expect like the strength in Mexico imports and the region down there to continue to be able to offset the weakness we've seen in U.S. mega beer?
John Hayes: Yeah, well, I would say I mean, what we've continued to see when you talk about kind of the top 10 brands in mega beer, they were off double digits for the full year. And then craft beer, Mexican imports and other things like cider, seltzers that go into that category, essentially offset it, so it's negligible a couple of decimal points down in aggregate for North Americas. Yes, we continue to see all the trends will suggest with the Hispanic millennial, so that will continue to be a demand stimulant and craft beer, it may not necessarily be that the craft beer segment is growing, but substrate penetration has a lot of legs left on it for us in the can.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I may just add, I do think people are talking a little bit too much about this mass beer in the United States. It's been in a slow decline for a number of years now and it's been declining. There's two large mass beer companies in the United States and they've collectively been declining around 3% on some of the bigger brands that Dan alluded to, one of them manufactures their own cans in-house and the other one we do effectively a 100% with in the United States. We’ve been able to more than offset that through exactly what Dan said and through other categories that have been growing whether it’s Mexican imports, whether it’s Kraft, whether it’s the alcoholic seltzers and we expect those trend trends to continue. One of the things we are seeing in terms of the mass is they are trying to use different types of cans and specialty cans to really help drive incremental volume. And we expect as we go forward, we’re going to see more and more of that going on.
Edlain Rodriguez: That makes sense. And one last one on Food and Aerosol, I mean I think you’ve noted that some of the volume growth was due to customers carrying more inventories into 2018. Will that lead to lower volume in 2018 given that it’s far been taken away volume from the first quarter or the second half?
John Hayes: You know it could. As we’re sitting here now, we really haven’t seen it. But you know that is a really a seasonal business. And until you get into the big seasonal selling season and planting season, it’s premature to tell. You are right, there was some pull ahead or appeared to be some pull ahead, but it was also a relatively muted pack as well. And so, it’s difficult to separate those two. I think overall though the market in the fourth quarter was up about 3%. We were up a little bit more than that. But again, for the full year, the overall market was down only about 1%. We were down a little bit more than that. But I wouldn’t read too much into that.
Edlain Rodriguez: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Adam Josephson: John, Scott, Dan, good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Adam Josephson: Just a couple on Brazil, and thanks for taking my questions by the way. Dan, I think you mentioned you expect to grow by a few points less in the market in 2018. Did you -- forgive me if I missed this, but what was the market up by in 2017 and roughly what are your expectations for 2018 in Brazil?
Scott Morrison: I think let me jump in because I have that in front of me. I know the overall market in the fourth quarter was up about just under 5%, 4.5%, 5% and I think overall for the full year, it was up about 3% to 4%.
Adam Josephson: And ….
John Hayes: And in reference to the – yeah, I said in reference to the go – the feature question. As we sit here today and refer back to my comment on who the winners and losers are going to be relative to the World Cup. I would expect this to grow slightly below the aggregate market because of the new market entrant.
Adam Josephson: Okay. But a similar level of market growth it sounds like an 2018 versus 2017 up three four sort of thing.
John Hayes: Yeah. The Brazilian economy is coming back, it's still – unemployment is still higher than what we'd like to see, but you're actually starting to see some positive economic indicators coming out of that. You're starting to see investment that's going to create job growth going into Brazil and that – to Dan's earlier comments about continued can penetration growth particularly in the beer side which makes up the majority of the can market. Those are the things that underweight the continued growth there.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. And just one other on Brazil, I think you mentioned about 1.5 billion cans coming in and I think let's call it a 26 billion can market. Correct me if I'm wrong there. So, we're talking 5% or 6% capacity growth, you’re talking about growth of 3% to 4%. So how do you think about just the interplay between those two factors and any pricing impact that you would anticipate based on the fact that it appears as if supply is growing a bit faster than demand this year?
Scott Morrison: Well, remember though, that’s a $1.5 billion, and it all doesn’t come on at once. It’s phased in. And they – that our competitors started up in the fourth quarter, but they haven’t completely ramped up all the way. So, you’re not going to get a full $1.5 billion in 2018.
Adam Josephson: Thank you very much, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Wilde: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: I wondered, Dan, if you can give us a little bit more guidance on the expansions that you announced yesterday in terms of both the cost and just the timing?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah, I think for, I mean, typically a new – this is a greenfield startup. And so, you think about in the 18-month to 24-month range depending on environmental permitting, and all the fun stuff that happens relative to that. We’ve obviously made some commitments to our, to our anchor investor there. The capital outlay would look consistent to a one line can point at startup. The difference for us is we’re going to use a lot of used equipment. So, it’ll be somewhat significantly less than a typical greenfield startup would be. And a greenfield startup one line could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $80 million to $100 million. It will be less than that, depending on how much used equipment and how much new equipment we have to use.
Mark Wilde: And what about in Argentina, Dan?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah in Argentina, we’ve got, we got a facility that -- we’ve continue to make small investments in and we’ll continue to build that facility out. It’s relatively insignificant in terms of capital dollars. So, I think our latest installment will be in the $10 million to $15 million range.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then just as a follow on, I wondered we’re seeing a little bit of an uptick in aluminum premiums, and I think some of your business in Latin America. America may be influenced by alumina premiums, can you just talk about sort of what type of impact and what you’re might be doing to kind of hedge yourself there?
Daniel Fisher: You’re able to hedge those premiums so, we won't see a near-term impact for any of that.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Scott. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Debbie Jones: Hi good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Debbie Jones: You made comments about the sourcing benefits and shared services that you think you can get. Should we assume that the opportunity is really in the U.S. and Europe or is this -- are you approaching this across your entire system?
John Hayes: No, it's really across our entire system. There's different opportunities in different places, so it's really across the three big segments and its just different buckets in different places, but in total we're really happy with where we're at, and what we expect to show up in 2018 and beyond in 2019.
Debbie Jones: Okay. And then just it seems to be a bit of renewed debate about plastics specifically in Europe as single-use plastics and I'm just wondering if you think that there could be an opportunity to kind of increase the shift away from let’s say PET and kind of the non-beer categories, are you having any of those conversations, is this an opportunity for you in certain regions?
John Hayes: Absolutely it is. I think all of us for a long time have recognized not only the inherent advantages of aluminum and used aluminum in a recycling stream, but also people are increasingly waking up to the very difficult fact that we're polluting our oceans and putting our world with plastic. And people often confuse recycling with collection too often that what happens is plastic gets collected, but doesn't necessarily get recycled. And last fall China turned off that spigot where they’re no longer accepting any import of any plastic and that's creating more and more of a discussion about it. I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the beverage can really be extolling our benefits as the most sustainable package in the world. And I would – you should expect to see Ball Corporation really starting to put its shoulder into that because I think it's the right thing to do, but more importantly it's in our economic best interest to do.
Debbie Jones: Okay. Thank you. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks. Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Gaffner: Dan when I think about some of the added complexity that you've mentioned on prior calls within this system, a lot of it seems to be on the printing side of the equation. I’m just wondering from a technological standpoint, has Ball or the industry really being able to solve some of that complexity, such that, it's not nearly as much of an issue as far as changeovers, et cetera within the system. How should we think about that?
Daniel Fisher: Yeah. I think there's been an awful lot of work that's gone on twofold. Obviously, digital printing is really sexy. I think a lot of folks are investing in that. That might be able to apply to certain segments of our business, think about craft beer. And obviously, the proliferation of labels there and – but the biggest thing right now, it's still costly. I don't know who's going to pay for it right now. There are some solves but it's at lower speeds and not quite what the industry needs in a $300 billion marketplace. But the other more likely is using robotics and automation on the printers, and obviously a lot of investments going in there. Nothing has really cemented itself in the four walls of our plans, but I think we're probably a lot closer to that than we have been historically, and why we’ve organized the way we have and around the global businesses to make sure that we're prioritizing investments and increasing skill mix in areas like that to get after that ahead of our competitors and in line with what our customers expect.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. And Scott, when I think about the share buyback for 2018, you said weighted to the second half of the year and I understand that's when you typically generate most of your free cash flow for the year. But if I look back historically, most of your share buybacks have been in the first half of the year. Is this only in the second half, because we're at an inflection point of trying to pay down the balance sheet first and then getting the free – to share repurchase or has there been a fundamental sort of rethink about when the timing of share repurchase throughout the year?
Scott Morrison: No, no fundamental change, it’s just we have a big working capital build that happens in the first half of the year, we'll be able to reassess our business after we get through the first quarter and be able to dial it in better. So just as we sit here right now that working capital build will use a lot of our cash right now. But I think 350 is a good starting point for 2018. And I see that growing in 2019, because I think our cash flow, we expect to get a $1 billion of free cash flow and will be at a point from a leverage standpoint we're really non-delevering has to occur. And I would see us being able to orient all or if not all, the vast majority of that cash to our share buyback and to our dividends and I see that continuing for a while, because this is going to be a cash machine.
Scott Gaffner: Sure. And the last thing is just on the working capital that you generated in 4Q, I mean, how much of that was coming out of the European business because if I recall correctly, I think that business in particular had higher than expected working capital uses in 4Q of 2016, just as broadening our line?
John Hayes: I think you're thinking about it right. The businesses, the large businesses that we acquired from Rexam, they weren't a EVA company. So obviously, there was more opportunity on those balance sheets to get a lot of cash flow. And we saw that going into the deal and our teams both from kind of our corporate treasury, sourcing legal standpoint working with the finance teams in each of those businesses did a fantastic job and there's more to come.
Scott Gaffner: All right. Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Brian Maguire: Hi, good morning, everyone.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Brian Maguire: Just wanted to cut back on South America, is obviously a really strong performance in there, at least relative to what we were expecting. Just wondered if you could, looking at the 23.5% margin you generated there, is that kind of in line with how you guys thought the quarter was going to shape up. And I just wanted to get a sense of how sustainable that was or if there were any sort of one timers or good guys in there that would reverse out in 2018 other than the – other than ends plant and the new entrant to the market that you called out?
John Hayes: Maybe, I’ll point, because as we've said in the past that you know that, that is an excellent management team we have scale there which is very important. It's a seasonally strongest quarter. And we grew volume wise 14%. That in large part is what drove the continued strong performance as Dan had mentioned and as I had talked about, as we go into 2018, I do think that, that is unsustainable from a margin perspective, because the competitive nature that Dan alluded to and because we'll be losing some end volume and so we're going to have to right size that size of it. But yes, we had a better than expected quarter in South America, but not just South America. Dan alluded to it, it’s in the rest of the surrounding countries, Argentina. That's why we're building in Paraguay, and Chile was another one that will continue strong growth. So, I think we did very well there and candidly above our own expectations.
Daniel Fisher: Yeah, I would just echo that. We were better than expected, but we were not surprised, and that's why we were able to deliver. So, we had – we were reading in August and September that this was going to be a strong fourth quarter from some of our major customers there, and we made sure that we had capacity on line in metal to deliver, and that's what showed up.
John Hayes: Okay. Great. And then just switching gears to the Food business. I think in the past, you've sort of articulated it, it doesn't consume a lot of capital, generates a lot of cash. Just wondering if the thought there on its strategic position in the overall company has changed at all in the last couple of months and just any thoughts on how that business will contribute to Ball going forward?
Daniel Fisher: Well, it's an important part of our business and it is part of our business until it’s not anymore, but our sole objective is to maximize the value of each and every one of our businesses, and we’ve had some manufacturing issues in the first half of 2017. We got pass those and you see since that time, they've had year-over-year profitability improvement. And as we go into 2018, we continue to expect continued improvement in that business. We are facing headwinds in terms of secular decline in terms of the Food category, the food can category, but that doesn't mean we don't expect to make more money as we go forward.
Brian Maguire: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed.
Chip Dillon: Yes, and good morning. A couple of questions. Could you update us on the start time that you expect for the Madrid plant? Number one. And number two, you mentioned I think Scott mentioned that CapEx in 2019 would likely be down. Would that be the case if it made sense and could it make sense to add capacity somewhere in Mexico given that it will have been a while since you last added that third line in Monterrey?
John Hayes: For the startup in Madrid I referenced in the notes at the beginning a little ahead of where we thought maybe 90 days ago, but tail end of May, beginning of June which is probably three to four weeks ahead of where we thought this time last quarter.
Scott Morrison: And on the CapEx side, as I mentioned, we've got some big projects coming on that'll come online in 2018 and then we'll see what kind of opportunities we have going forward. We're always talking with our customers to make sure that if they're growing we're able to supply that growth and we'll see where that takes us.
Chip Dillon: And then just as a quick follow on. Can you talk a little bit about how your mix changed last year or either you know in a given region or as a company when you look at specialty versus standard? And is that partly a factor in what's going on down in South America? You mentioned the new competitor. Are they mainly coming into the standard sizes and that's sort of and therefore that's what you're losing in terms of share and maybe that will be over time offset by higher specialty volumes? Any comments there would be helpful.
John Hayes: Yes, so it's hard to parse out the definition of what is standard and specialty can is outside of the U.S. because all the other markets around the world have essentially gone through something other than a standard 12 ounce or 33 scintillator can. So, the competitors coming in with cans that are not at 33 scintillator can, but that doesn't mean that that's not the overwhelming majority of product that shift in that marketplace. And I think our specialty growth has been in line or slightly ahead in probably every region in the world and we continue to see that continuing as that's what the end consumer preference is, that's what our customers want and that's what we've been investing in.
Scott Morrison: Just to give you context, sorry, on a global basis, our specialty mix is about 37%, and to Dan's point in South America, it's almost 50%. When you think about how we define it in the United States, and it's even much greater in EMEA, it's closer to 80% to Dan's point. And so, it varies, but we are seeing growth in specialty stronger than growth in quote, "standard in every major market".
Chip Dillon: And the 45% in Brazil, that's just for beer or for everything?
Scott Morrison: No. That's for everything.
Chip Dillon: Okay. Thank you so much.
Scott Morrison: Yeah. And when you said 45%, I want to clarify. I said just under 50%, so it's between 45% and 50%.
Chip Dillon: Okay. Of the share that can have them all – all beverage continues?
Scott Morrison: Clarification, the 45% is can mix. And so what John referenced was the mix within that can mix. Yeah, the specialty – set in other way, just under 50% of all cans we sell in South America are specialty containers.
Chip Dillon: Understood, but you had said earlier that the can share of all substrates I believe or was it just for beer went from 43% to 45%? That was in the prepared remarks. I didn't know if that was for beer or for everything?
Scott Morrison: I'm sorry. That was just for beer.
Chip Dillon: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Staphos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for all the details and for taking my question. So, I know you didn't really want to chat too much about or you feel that we chat too much about North American beverage. I want to come back to a question here as it relates to the fourth quarter. Was there anything aberrational from what you saw in terms of your customers and/or their customers in terms of destocking. We had heard from some of our contacts that there might have been a little bit of effect there, were in effect related to changes in excise taxes part of the overall tax policy regime change that we've had in the states. I don't know if you have any numbers around that but I was curious. And then on specialty, maybe piggybacking off of Chip’s last question, what was the specialty growth for you? Recognizing it's difficult to parse, you had to put a number on it either globally or within North America in the quarter?
Scott Morrison: I'd say on the destocking and in excise tax really no, no impact to us. And then on the specialty growth…
John Hayes: Yeah, it was about 10% on a global basis.
George Staphos: Okay. Thank you for that. And then the next question I had, if we think about the synergies with Rexam, and again traditionally, it was around SG&A procurement footprint. And it sounds like from your comments earlier in the presentation that those are at least trending in line or better than your expectations. I know better than to ask you for a specific number guys but is there any one bucket that is seeming maybe a little bit better than your initial expectations, recognizing that the whole pie is at least in line or better than where you initially started? And if so, could you provide some additional clarity around that?
Scott Morrison: Yeah. Let me -- let’s take a step back and when we said that net 300, it roughly broke into about a third a third, a third between G&A, sourcing and then manufacturing/footprint/all other. On the G&A side, we said we'd probably get half of it through closure of offices, and recall that we closed the Millbank office, and remember that in June of last year, we closed the Charlotte office. We probably got a half or a little bit more of that. The second half of it, it's going to be coming from moving a lot of activities into our shared services areas that we stood up in 2017, including Querétaro, Mexico and Belgrade. So, we have yet to get half of that $100 million from G&A, and we expect to get that late 2018, but really going into 2019. On the sourcing side, we have gotten all of that, and of that roughly $100 million and we think there could be a little bit more as we go into 2018. And then, as you know, on the footprint side, we have announced the closure of Recklinghausen and closed it in August, we announced the closure of Reidsville in United States and closed that last summer. We have only haven't even gotten a full year benefit of those, and we've announced three additional closures in North America that we've gotten zero benefit from. And we said between those three things on a run rate basis, it's approximately $120 million.
George Staphos: Okay. Fair enough. And so, when it actually occurs then you can measure it, then we can ask you at least qualitatively how you performed there, but certainly nothing that would suggest that you're not trending where you expect to be on that front. Phase 4, can you provide a little more clarity in terms of what phase goes into Phase 4 and is there any commercial benefit built into that recognizing it would be in excess of the $300 million dollar plus that you had guided to.
John Hayes: Well, I'll stand by what I said, that we have counted on no benefits in any of the numbers we've talked about from a 2019 perspective in our related to the commercial activities. But the various types of things that you should think about that we are contemplating is number one, let’s just focus here in North America. Dan, talked about we are building a new plant and closing three new facilities and we're adding no new net capacity. So, we're closing standard 12 ounce and adding specialty. The continued growth of that is a part of it. Changing the customer mix over in Europe where we were far too over weighted to soft drink is a part of it. I talked about in Europe that we inherited some contracts that were declining year-over-year to at a minimum stop that decline is another example. I could go on and on, but there's hundreds of different things, in terms of being more disciplined about the call off, fences that we allow our customers to order, so they can't change their orders within 12 hours, but they need 48 hours or 72 hours to do it. There is hundreds of different things. Those often require renegotiation of contracts. And as you know George and the other people know that when we closed on the acquisition of it, we said we have no big contracts coming up for a couple of years. So, you put that all together and hopefully you're starting to see a mosaic that we're painting towards.
George Staphos: That's where I was going with the remaining question so. I appreciate the color guys. I'll turn it over and congratulations on the year.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Chris Manuel: Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a strong finish to the year and really good outlook here for 2018 and beyond. I wanted to switch gears a second if I could, and help us a little bit with aerospace. So, I kind of look at the progress of the backlog, just two years ago the backlog was around $600 million, so you almost tripled the backlog over the last couple of years and I know there kind of tends to be a little bit of a lag as that gets monetizing goes forward. But appreciating that we’re packaging analysts moonlighting in this aerospace business to try to cover help us with how you would anticipate revenue and EBIT growth goes in the next couple of years? Thinking about something that’s $10 million to $20 million of EBIT growth that does that sound crazy to you in the next couple of years?
John Hayes: No. I think that’s not the realm of possibility at all. The only point of nuance that I would add is usually the growth of the profitability on the frontend of those contracts is a little bit slower as you de-risk those contracts and it ramps up. And so, I think as we start to execute on this you’re going to see all things being equal or slightly muted growth and then if we perform well, we see it on the backend as you know and we’ve done that time and time again.
Chris Manuel: Okay. And the new business has come in is it proportionally weighted towards fixed or cost plus or how should we think about kind of where that sits?
John Hayes: Yeah. No. It’s a little bit more proportionally weighted towards cost plus and we have been over the last three to five years. A lot of these are very big programs, some of them are developmental programs and as you know in a developmental program, the cost plus is far more favorable for us and our customer because the specs, if you will, have not been defined.
Chris Manuel: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, one question for Scott. As we think about the working capital component, I think you indicated this year perhaps another $100 million and how should we think about that going forward? Does it start to appreciating at a lot you wanted to bring out of Rexam as you translate it -- migrated them towards an EVA platform, but metal costs are going up a little bit, should we kind of think that working capital begins to flatten out after 2018 or do you feel you start a little more runway?
John Hayes: I was way too early to tell. We think 100 is a good proxy for 2018, but every year, our people have been – when people are motivated by EVA, they get incredibly creative on ways generate even more. And so, I'm sure as we get through 2018, they'll be thinking about what we can do in 2019.
Chris Manuel: Or perhaps, there's something as you open up Goodyear and you get the other three plants closed that can continue to move as well. So okay, that's helpful.
John Hayes: Yeah.
Chris Manuel: Last question I had was book and cash tax. So, I think you indicated that the book rate was going to migrate down in 2019 or 2018, I'm sorry.
John Hayes: 2018.
Chris Manuel: 2018. You have a number for us to what you did cash taxes in 2017 and what you think kind of a reasonable cash tax rate might be on a go-forward basis from here?
John Hayes: We didn't pay much in the way of cash taxes in 2017. We've got NOLs that we’re utilizing, and we will pay much in the way in 2018. That wasn't – that wasn’t different with the tax reform that was already anticipated.
Chris Manuel: That's for our U.S. tax.
John Hayes: Correct U.S. taxes.
Chris Manuel: Yeah. So, as a whole corporate. I mean, there’s something in the 20%-ish range reasonable for cash taxes going forward?
John Hayes: It would be -- there would be -- let me check on that, Chris, and I'll get back to you, I think it's lower amount.
Chris Manuel: Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Just a question on the European margins. They are slightly below our estimate. And just wondering, if that was more due to a metal pass through or if it’s just kind of delayed benefits from some of the actions or if it’s just kind of delayed benefits from some of the actions you’ve taken there like working housing?
John Hayes: You’ve got a -- are you adjusting for the depreciation change?
Arun Viswanathan: Yes.
Scott Morrison: Well, I think there -- to answer is they’re in line or ahead of where we anticipated 90 days ago. So, I can’t comment on it Bob.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, no problem. Similarly, in the U.S., I guess, your margins also on our basis was little bit lower. But how would you characterize that versus your own expectations? Was there added softness from the beer weakness?
John Hayes: No, we didn’t, I mean, we didn’t experience the beer weakness in Q4 largely due to our customer mix and our segment mix. The only thing, we were favorable on basically every line item of our cost structure in the fourth quarter with the exception of the continued headwinds on the freight rates. But all-in-all, we were ahead of where we thought we’d be in Q4 in the U.S. as well.
Arun Viswanathan: And then just real quickly what will an appropriate level of corporate expense per quarter going ahead?
Scott Morrison: Well, I’d say it’d be 115 for the full fourth quarter.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
John Hayes: Well, thank you.
John Hayes: All right. Nelson, we’ll take one more question, then we’ll wrap it up.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is a follow up from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Wilde: Yeah, I’m just curious if we can get any sense of what the incremental CapEx is in Aerospace?
Scott Morrison: Yeah, so it’s an excess of $100 million.
Mark Wilde: Spread over several years.
Scott Morrison: Yeah, spread over couple of years. We’ve got, if you come out to Colorado market, we’ve got a number of big projects going on right now to expand the number of test facilities and manufacturing facilities. And that will be mostly in 2018 and in 2019.
John Hayes: Yeah. And just to give you a context, in our satellite manufacturing, we're building some more chambers by which you test, so much larger chambers. And then, as you know, we've experienced some very strong growth in our tactical products, which are the -- everything from the stealth antennas to the video cameras. And we are building on a very large manufacturing wing onto our existing manufacturing site. Those were the probably the two biggest ones and if you came out and wanted to visit, we’d be happy to show you.
Mark Wilde: I'd love to do that. John, I just wanted to ask about this diet coke rollout. That's they've been publicizing over the last several weeks, and lately, it’s going into sleek cans. And I wondered if you’re just – you're seeing kind of more inquiries from the beverage companies on that sort of thing.
John Hayes: Yeah. I think that hits to the trend that Dan talked about earlier and I did as well, I think you're seeing that's why we're seeing 10% growth on a global basis of our specialty. And I think repositioning that is a great example of creating profit pools for themselves and using specialty cans to help do it for them.
Mark Wilde: And if that works, if that roll out takes, will they usually use the same packaging format kind of globally, so they use the sleek cans in other markets around the world.
John Hayes: Not necessarily because tastes are very different by geography and region, and also they have different bottlers that have different areas of focus, but I do think the use of specialty generally is you are seeing more and more across all of our customer base.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That's helpful. Listen, good luck in the year.
John Hayes: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
John Hayes: Okay. Great. Thank you, Nelson, and thank you, everyone for your participation and we look forward to a strong 2018.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 2, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2017 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially for those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company's news release. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now, joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I'll provide some brief introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss the key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our Food and Aerospace businesses and the outlook. We achieved improved third quarter comparable operating earnings, particularly in South America and despite lower performance in our North American Metal Beverage business in the latter part of the quarter. First, given the devastation caused by the hurricanes, earthquakes, and recent fires that raged in our Fairfield, California facility, we're thankful that all our fellow coworkers, their families, and our physical assets in Florida, Texas, California, and Mexico are safe. Thank you everyone at Ball and beyond who lent a helping hand to their colleagues, families, and communities who are personally impacted by these natural disasters. Candidly, the hurricanes were a perfect storm that ripped through Ball's supply chain late in the quarter and then two of Ball's largest North American regions. To put the hurricanes into perspective, while our Conroe, Texas and Tampa, Florida plants suffered some downtime, they recovered in relatively good shape. However, the downtime at our key customers' filling locations continued well beyond the aftermath of the storms and resulted in a combined seven days of lost production due to lack of orders for us in the regions and meaningfully lower can sales. For example, industry sales in the alcoholic category were down 12% in September with much of that happening in Texas in the southeast filler locations. In addition, significant spikes in freight rates and out-of-pattern freight across our southern and lower Atlantic plant network accelerated after the hurricane events and negatively impacted our results. We understand that FEMA, for example, consumed nearly 10% of the available freight hauling capacity after the water subsided and freight surcharges increased materially during this time. Freight and fuel rates continue to be higher than before the hurricanes and we're attempting to offset this high cost freight expenses with existing passthroughs and additional surcharges where contracts allow. To state the obvious, this has been challenging and frustrating and it has overshadowed an otherwise good performance across the rest of our company, but we'll push through, Ball folks always do. Dan Fisher will provide additional color on the overall Global Beverage Can business in a moment. Moving on and highlighting some of the great work being done during the third quarter. We began to see results from some of the actions taken in our European Beverage business with margins and profitability improving year-over-year. Our South American Beverage business experienced meaningful volume improvement with growth equally spread throughout all of South America. We further improved our G&A cost structure with the launch of our shared service centers in Queretaro, Mexico and Belgrade, Serbia. We transitioned beverage can production from Reidsville, North Carolina to Tampa, Florida and Rome, Georgia; however, this was impacted a bit during the hurricanes in Florida. We significantly improved manufacturing efficiencies at our Canton, Ohio metal service center. We hired additional staff in our Aerospace business to service existing and future contracts, while staying on time and on budget with important facility expansions. And year-to-date, we acquired a net $85 million of our stock and paid out $93 million of dividends. Our multi-year, value-capture plans are on course. And while we're disappointed in the third quarter performance of our beverage North America and Central America segment in light of the hurricanes, we have a clear line of sight to all of the synergies identified when we announced the transaction. Our plans are on track to capture cost savings and to grow comparable EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Third quarter was quite dynamic from a demand and operational perspective, and John described it well. Global beverage can volumes grew 2% in the quarter. The beverage can is winning across multiple geographies and we continue to promote its sustainable qualities and product capabilities to our customers and consumers. John outlined the U.S.-weather related struggles in the quarter, so I won't dwell on the short-term situation impacting global beverage results because it does not impact our three-year outlook for our Beverage business. Instead, let's focus our attention on the future opportunities to make disciplined growth investments while addressing our cost structure across each of our regional segments. North American volumes were flat in the quarter due to domestic beer declines, and our larger presence with these customers was offset by growth in imported beer, craft, sparkling water and certain carbonated soft drinks. In the middle of the quarter, we announced our U.S. network optimization plans with the closures of Birmingham, Longview and Chatsworth and the construction of the Goodyear, Arizona specialty can plant, which will provide annualized net savings of $50 million beginning in the latter part of 2018. And as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the severe impacts of the U.S. weather events are largely behind us and our team is focused on executing on its network optimization plans, streamlining processes and systems to lower our cost structure and having certain headwinds like lower absorption, out-of-pattern freight and the PPI drag turning the tailwinds in 2018. Our South American business had a very good quarter. Segment volume grew double digits led by Brazil. Ball's business benefited from our customer mix, our product portfolio in proximity to near-term market needs in the region. We anticipate further strength in Brazil and surrounding countries during the fourth quarter as we move into the busy summer selling season south of the equator. We do, however, anticipate a higher level of competitiveness in 2018 and 2019 as competitor's new plant comes online. The European business saw mid-single digit volume growth, which was in line with industry demand. Our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track. Our near and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to where Ball's legacy business was are moving at a reasonable pace given the complexity of our transformation projects. The €40 million annualized cost savings from the recent Recklinghausen closures will really begin in a meaningful way in the fourth quarter. The financial contribution from our Central American joint ventures in Guatemala and Panama were off slightly due to customer and production timing in Central America. In EMEA, we are not without our challenges, like the demand volatility we deal with on a daily basis related to political and economic unrest across the Middle East and the carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia leading to low demand in the region. The EMEA team has done an amazing job dealing with the complexity. In the third quarter, our China volumes were down 6% versus the market growing 6%. Ball will continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this market. In summary, our Global Beverage business has posted strong results in South America and Europe with good demand trends and their ability to cover off the incremental year-over-year depreciation. It's been a tough couple of months for our North America and EMEA teams following the hurricanes and the Saudi carbonation tax. Everyone is driving to the best EVA outcome possible in 2017 and our multi-year thesis for acquiring Rexam is intact. Looking forward, I feel good about where our Global Beverage business is headed. Growth in differentiated sizes, initiatives to more fully utilize our global shared service centers and having a team of global key account directors laser focused on securing the best value possible for our tremendous product portfolio. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2017 earnings were $0.52, which included $11 million of additional depreciation versus $0.48 in 2016. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance except for North America Beverage, lower corporate cost, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Net debt ended the quarter at $7 billion, which was $450 million lower year-over-year, though slightly above our plan due to the $95 million impact of a higher euro. Net debt will continue to come down as we move through the remainder of the year. At current FX rates and given our euro debt exposure, our year-end net debt will likely be closer to $6.5 billion and this will not impede our plan to return value to shareholders via share repurchases in 2018. As we think about the remainder of 2017, we expect full-year 2017 comparable EBITDA in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, free cash flow to be in excess of $850 million after spending in the range of $550 million of CapEx. Full-year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $290 million, up $10 million from our prior target of $280 million. The full year and fourth quarter effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 25% due to the geography of the earnings mix and corporate undistributed will be in the range of $135 million for full-year 2017, an improvement of $5 million from our prior guidance. The cash is showing up and we feel good about where we're at. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contracts performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. The team at Ball Aerospace is winning. All of it hasn't translated over to meaningful operating earnings improvement or contracted backlog yet. However, staff is being added weekly to be positioned for the ramp up of these key wins. The aerospace team has done a wonderful job managing through the ever changing winds of Washington D.C. We have an exciting launch of JPSS-1 scheduled for next week and we remain more constructive today regarding the United States budgetary process and how it can help translate programs wins into profitable earnings growth. Now, as we look forward, we are on track to achieve the financial benefits of the acquisition. Our Aerospace business is poised for another bump up. Our food and aerosol team has attacked costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies to Ball standards and our Metal Beverage Packaging businesses are preparing for further growth and cost-out initiatives. When we closed on the acquisition in June of 2016, we expected 2017 EBITDA to be in excess of $1.75 billion and free cash flow to be in excess of $750 million. As mentioned in the press release, we will likely be short of our original 2017 EBITDA goal due to our beverage North and Central America performance this quarter and the manufacturing inefficiencies we experienced early in the year in our Food and Aerosol segment, which is now behind us. However, our cash flow continues to show up at or above our goals at that time despite higher capital expenditures. We still expect that by 2019 we can generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. So when we announced our intentions to acquire Rexam, we said that we would rapidly de-lever, capture synergies, spend any necessary growth capital on high-returning projects, and then returning our remaining free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and that's exactly what we're doing. And with that, Jennifer, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. First off on North America, clearly, you guys are focusing across the company on free cash flow generation. But in that process, were you running maybe a little bit too tight on inventories, which was sort of exacerbated by the weather impact? I'm just trying to think about that dynamic potential.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think in Q2, if you remember, there was growth in the 2% to 3% range. We benefited from that and we entered Q3 at lower stocking levels than we anticipated heading into the year and that problem, as you rightly pointed out, probably exacerbated some of the issues that we had in Q3 with the weather patterns.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then in your comments, Dan, on the PPI reversal for 2018 versus what you saw this year, with that framework, I mean, you are going to see surcharges in freight still, a lot of your coatings companies are talking about higher coating prices et cetera that they're trying to implement because their costs have gone up. Do you feel that you're going to be at price cost parity in 2018 versus maybe what you saw in 2017?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yes. And I think if you reflect back on probably some earlier comments in and around moving into this year, we've largely negotiated both metal and ODM contracts for the foreseeable future, and in each of our contracts we try to lock end-to-end with our commercial contracts on the pass-through mechanism. So, I don't see a tremendous amount of risk there. The surcharge, as you said, we're still seeing accelerated freight rates in the Texas and the Southeast areas on the increased rates for freight. The advantage is though, and what we're laser focused on, it's much like your earlier question, we're trying to get our stocking levels back at a place that we feel comfortable with and that's what we've been focused on for the last two to three weeks. And that's going to allow us to better manage out-of-pattern freight or mitigate that and really – feel really good about what the North America team is doing in that regard.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I'll just add, Ghansham, on that very last point that some of our contracts, commercial contracts, are clear of what we can and cannot do with respect to passing through these higher freight charges and we are, as Dan said, focused like a hawk on where we're able to go after that. Rest assured we are going after that.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Terrific. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. In August, you announced the three bev camp plant closures in the U.S. and the greenfield in Arizona. I was wondering if you could give us any more detail on the timing of the greenfield can plant, maybe CapEx cost capacity, any kind of further color you can give? And then with the closures, is it possible to say how much net capacity you're reducing or any way that we can understand the total – the impact of the total number of cans you're producing or the mix between 12 ounce and specialty?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Why don't I attack the first – last part of the question and Dan can could talk about timing of them. With regard to the overall capacity, we're going to be net flat to slightly down, but there should be a big shift because majority of the capacity we're closing is standard capacity and we're adding in a lot of specialty. Specialty continues to grow for us. The Southwest is an important market for us. And so you should expect net 12 ounce to be declining, while specialty is increasing in that region. Dan, do you want to talk about timing?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And in terms of the specific restructuring timeline, I think we've made some of these announcements public, but both Longview and Birmingham we feel in the Q2, beginning of Q3 would be the closure date. Obviously, we'd have to have capacity in place in the new facility in order to do that. Those plants are still online and then Chatsworth will be toward the tail end of 2018.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the timing and CapEx costs around Arizona?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, what we've said in the past was we're going to be focused on in the range of about $500 million of CapEx as we go forward over the 2017, 2018, 2019 time period. And as you recall, our maintenance CapEx we believe to be about half of that. So embedded in that $500 million assumption is things such as Arizona. So, I don't think there's any appreciable more capital other than what we've said. There's always a timing issue, and I think that the slight raise in terms of what we expect for CapEx this year has to do with accelerating some of those – some of that CapEx, particularly for Goodyear because, as Dan mentioned, we need to get the capacity up and going before we can get – start getting those savings out.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Scott, I understand this may be difficult, but is it possible to quantify the hit that you saw from hurricanes just from a dollar perspective in 3Q?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. The way I would look at it is if you look at Q2 versus Q3, I would put it in kind of three buckets; a third, a third, a third. And Dan touched upon the first one or one of them, which was the absorption coming into that season with probably lighter inventories, and we have had pretty good growth in the second quarter. So that's about a third of it. Lost volume just from the decline from the hits from those that our customers experienced would be about a third and then a third would be a combination of both freight rates and out-of-pattern freight during that period.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Scott, just following up on that for a minute. Obviously, you took up the free cash flow guidance, but you also took up the CapEx guidance. So I would assume you're looking for a little bit better working capital management. Could you talk about maybe where you're getting some of that with these inventory absorption issues that you're discussing in the quarter?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, it's kind of separate from the inventory, but I mean, unfortunately, we probably had too light of inventory going into that busy season. But by the year end, really it's the EVA mentality across our businesses that's taking hold. We thought there would be good opportunities in our business in the new balance sheet that we have to get a lot of money out of the working capital, and everybody from finance to the operations folks around the world have been very effective. And I think we're experiencing some of the benefits we expected to get a little sooner than what we originally anticipated. So we were all happy with where we're at.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So you're saying it's more on the receivables and payables side, is what you would say on working capital?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And then, selectively, in other places in inventory, there's always going to – the magic is having the right inventory, right? So, it's having the right inventory, but clearly we're a little too tight in the second quarter coming into the third quarter but by year end my comments were more focused on year end.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And when we look to realign...
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Go ahead, sorry.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was just getting – I just going to move on to the synergies, but if you wanted to close out there first, that's fine.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. Go ahead.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: As you can say, on the realized synergies, I think you guys had mentioned the $150 million for 2017 before – do some of the issues in the third quarter plus the manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year, do that maybe lower that number for 2017, but then we get those back in 2018?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Not at all. It was separate and apart from anything to do with the synergies. And when you think about it, it had to do with the – in the Food and Aerosol, and I'm happy to report that that is behind us. And you see that one of the things I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, but overall food can volumes were down about 10% in the quarter. Aerosol was roughly flat and so you see very good cost performance in that business. That obviously had nothing to do with the synergies and then as Scott just pointed out in terms of the lost sales absorption because of the lower inventories we had and then the higher freight, both in terms of out-of-pattern and overall freight rates, that's what really affected it. So there's been no change at all to our synergies.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck for the rest of the year.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to come back to the North American beverage volumes. I'm trying to parse out the hurricane impact from it. It seemed like just from looking at the industry data even if you threw out the down 12 sort of September, the volumes would have been a little bit light kind of going into that event. So, just wondering if you could kind of comment on what you think the underlying trends are. Was there maybe some pull forward to earlier in the year when volumes were a little bit better than expected and any kind of color you can give on kind of October trends now that we've maybe kind of worked through some of the hurricane issues?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. This is John. Why don't I take that first part. There was a meaningful impact. Let me give you some statistics here. Year-to-date through August, overall beverage cans in the United States were flat. In the month of September, they were down 6.5%. When you break that down between alcoholic and non-alcoholic, alcoholic they were down 2.5% year-to-date through August and they were down 12% in September. And in the non-alcoholic side, they actually were up 1.5% year-to-date through August and were down 2.5-plus percent in the month of September. So you can clearly see what happened. I do think that there was a lot of good heads up around these hurricanes in the days, if not week or two prior to it. There was able, perhaps, to be some stock up, although we don't see weekly data like that, so it's not – I don't think it's appreciative. But when you have total communities underwater for, I won't say weeks, but certainly a week plus at a time and you don't have the ability for your customers to be filling and you don't have the ability to be shipping either our product to our customers or our customers to their distributors or retailers, it does have an impact, and I think those statistics show.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And so just to summarize, you think the outlook for North America going forward is still for sort of flattish to maybe up a little bit on volume?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I did answer your last question. I think, in October, what we've seen is they have bounced back as the supply chain starts to normalize. And so we've seen back to normal improvement yet – but as we've said all along, I think longer term we expect flattish demand in North America and we can happy to go through some of the trends. They've actually reversed because you recall over the last five to seven years, actually, cans – beer cans have been up and soft drink has been down. It has reversed. We've benefited candidly from some customers down in Mexico that have helped us in that whole segment, but I think it's no surprise. Big Beer here in the United States has been struggling. The cans have been doing well. Actually, it's been taking share from glass. It's just overall Big Beer in America has declined and it's encouraging to see the soft drink has started to get some growth back in the can as well.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay great. And just for a follow-up question. Just thinking about the bridge from the – I guess the midpoint of $1.725 billion of EBITDA to the $2.19 billion implies you've got to grow about $275 million. And without giving any kind of 2018 guidance yet, just thinking about the cadence of that. It does seem like the 2018 you'll have some duplicative costs from all the planned consolidation. I don't know if there's any way to kind of quantify that or maybe verify that, and just thinking about that bridge, do you think it will be kind of equally split between the years or maybe a little bit back-end loaded because of that consolidation effort next year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well I think we'll get – we're right on track with kind of the three-year plan that we had when we acquired Rexam. And the footprint things that we're doing that we announced recently in North America, most of those don't take hold to the back half of 2018 and into 2019. The capital that we're spending at some of the growth projects that we have start to come online next year in 2018 then more in 2019. So we're right on track with where we thought we would be.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And let's not forget we're experiencing duplicative costs now. I mean, we talked earlier in the year about the G&A and we were able to get in the short-term G&A out through the closure of Millbank and the closure of Charlotte, but then we are reinvesting and we just stood up in this quarter two shared services centers, one in Serbia, one in Mexico. So we are having duplicative costs. I think to Scott's point, what we've told people is we expect the next chunk of SG&A to come out as we transition many of these back office services from the various plants in regional locations to the shared service locations, but it's hard work. There's a lot of process, there's a lot of process redesign, there's a lot of manual efforts going on right now that we are going to – we'll be looking to automate, and that's probably a second half 2018 event as well. So, we are experiencing duplicative cost now.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll turn it over now. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I think just in your prepared remarks you said in South America in 2018 and 2019 results could be impacted by more competition. I guess, I mean give a – I guess a sense of how big of an impact and is it more – is it volumes, is it margins, just any details there would be helpful?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think, at this point, it's probably too early to call. I think from a supply/demand standpoint, we do know that a greenfield facility is coming up. We also know that a competitor is converting a steel plant to an aluminum plant. So largely, and we've said this historically, it's all dependent on the growth from a supply/demand standpoint. How quickly Brazil recovers, keep in mind, we're still down over the last couple of years in that marketplace, and we like what we're seeing in the last couple of months, but two months is not a trend make. So, we'll have to wait and see on that. The volumes outside of Brazil are really strong and we're benefiting from that. But I'd say it's probably premature to make a call on exactly what all is going to transpire relative to 2018, 2019 in the competitive landscape. We do recognize though that the supply/demand is something that we're laser focused on as the new greenfields come up.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just with Europe, I think sort of EBIT excluding the higher depreciation was up around $10 million. Maybe just give a rough sense in terms of how much have been – was volume-related currency and just the improved operating performance.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think it comes in three or four different areas. Number one, volume was up low-single digits, as Dan had mentioned on this conference call on his prepared remarks, I think a little over 2% or so. So obviously that helps. Cost side, we're doing a much better job on that. We did inherit some contracts that had some pricing challenges for us as we went into 2017. So that's kind of a headwind relative to it, but to be up in that segment, as you said, about $10 million or so given that we really haven't gotten much. If any of the benefits from some of these larger strategic actions around the plant in Germany, et cetera, we have a long way to go. We recognize that, but we are on the path that we expected.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, just one on Mexico and your U.S. beer business. Just given that your U.S. business is so much larger than your Mexico business, can you just help me understand how one would fully offset the other?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, it's – when you – I assume you're largely talking about beer...
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: ...because it's really what we actually do. But when you think about it, you're right, in terms of Big Beer in the United States, that's been challenging. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but as I mentioned before, I know the can is taking share from other substrate, such as when the beer market is down 2.5% or so it's challenging particularly when the base is so big. We have been a beneficiary in Mexico of a couple of customers and we've been very strong in that region. But let's also not forget the craft beer side that we've talked about for a while where, I think, in the third quarter again we were up close to 30% in that segment. So you combine those three together and that's why we're able to offset many of these things.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I would just add to that, Adam. I mean it's pretty simple, right? The Mexico beer is growing at 8% to 10% and the craft's growing at 30% plus. So the magnitude of that growth pattern is how we're able to offset the 2.5% decline on the bigger base.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Just one on Brazil. I know the biggest brewer down there, their beer volume was down about 5.5%. Meanwhile, the can market was up mid-single digits – one of the public bottlers was up substantially in Brazil. So it seems like the packaging trends have significantly diverged from the trends of the under – the biggest brewer there. Can you help me understand that, or why that might be the case?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: There's a couple things going on. I think there's definitely a premiumization of beer that's afoot in that marketplace. Those folks are largely, if not exclusively, going into cans and that market's growing. There has been a reversal of the biggest brewer in that market in terms of pushing returnable glass over the last couple of years back to stabilizing their pack mix because they're losing, in some instances, to these startups in the craft brew. So it's really a good mix for us. You're right that the leader (33:34) is down, but there's definitely a movement afoot from the largest brewer all the way down to the smaller ones to move more of a pack mix to cans. There is also, from a retail standpoint, quite a push from a sustainability point right now in the bigger cities that we're benefiting from. So the sustainability message is definitely helping in the last six months. We'll keep our eye on that. We'll obviously keep promoting that, but a lot of good packaging trends for the can right now and not only there, but in the other Latin American countries.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I may just add on to that that we've been, candidly, pleasantly surprised by the can growth down in Brazil. I think we see all the trends that Dan just mentioned. The economy, it's flattened out, but it certainly hasn't improved. So whether you look at GDP is flat, now that's better than down 3%, but unemployment is still too high, it's still in the teens, the 11% to 12% range and we really need the middle class to be growing to get that leverage (34:35) growing, because think of the logarithmic opportunity we have if we can get the leverage (34:39) going and the pack share changing.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, John. Just one last one on the synergy question. I know you mentioned you still expect to get the $150 million this year. Are you at liberty to say what you actually realized in 3Q and what you expect to realize in 4Q?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, we said from day one that we're not going to go into that level of detail because you end up parsing things out and you hire a bunch of accountants to do what? It doesn't make us any money by doing that.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Mr. Staphos, your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. I didn't hear the introduction. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question, all the details. I wanted to try to come back to the storm effect one more time if possible. Scott, you'd mentioned three buckets and you looked at the 2Q to 3Q sequential effect or guided us to think about it that way. Could you give us some view on what the storm effect was in total for the third quarter or how North America and Central America performed relative to what your expectations might have been going into the quarter? And then the related question, as we parse your fourth quarter EBITDA guidance and what it comes out at relative your nine-month, how is that relative to what your expectations might have been heading into July or August earlier this year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Okay. Well, the first part of that, I would have expected the third quarter to be close to the second quarter and that's why I used that as a reference point. So that's the magnitude that we're talking about.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And then the third, a third, a third buckets still hold true. On the fourth quarter numbers, we don't expect to have – we're still seeing some freight rates and things, but we expect to have no meaningful impact from the third quarter carrying over into the fourth quarter. We expect Brazil to be – South America to be strong. And so all that kind of bakes into our fourth quarter expectations.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And just I guess to close the loop, then, on it, Scott – I apologize. So fourth quarter, even with all these headwinds, is more or less trending as you would have expected a couple of months ago? Obviously, there's a mixture of pluses and minuses, would that be a fair summation?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, the only caveat I would put on that, George is we said freight rates remain elevated. We're going after them where we can, but obviously we're not saying we've covered them off yet right now. So the longer they persist, the little bit more headwind we have in that, but that's the only thing. Volumes have bounced back, the plants have bounced back, the supply chain has bounced back, it's just the freight is a bit higher.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Yeah, I appreciate you taking the question there. I want to come back to South America, Dan, and you mentioned a couple of things in the market in answering an earlier question that prompted the commentary, but from what I recall those are relatively pre-existing conditions, both the conversion and the new plant. So is there anything else that's triggered your comment, just to flag it for us heading into 2018, or is it just a fiduciary heads up you just wanted to make there?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: It's exactly a fiduciary heads up. And practically speaking, George, the new greenfield is coming online now. So it's not speculation or thesis. It's real. So, that's the intent behind the comment.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood. Two last ones, and I'll turn it over. Can you comment at all, either qualitatively or in some sort of quantified measure, realizing it's kind of hard to do that, how your progress has been in terms of selling – going back to the Investor Day complexity and promoting value over volume in terms of how Ball goes to market relative to your customers?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think the downside to the hurricanes that we experienced is probably the upside of selling that through because we kept all our customers in cans. It just caused us a heck of a lot of money to do that. That will enable those conversations to take a very different tone in a very real tone. And as these contracts start to roll off in the future, we will make it a point, George, to ensure that we have mechanisms built into these contracts that reciprocate the risk and the inefficiencies to both parties. Unfortunately, in some of the instances, we've got historical contracts that don't allow us to do that as effective as I think we can have those conversations now.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, and George specifically just to give you some data points, around the world, Dan mentioned we have 2% volume growth around the world. We had almost 9% specialty volume growth around the world. And so it was a bit impacted here in North America for the exact reasons Dan just mentioned, but we continue to push this and it's part of our strategy.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: John, my last one, I'll turn it over. Thanks for all the color. Aerospace, you mentioned a number of metrics. I'm talking about the performance in the quarter. We have the backlog. You're hiring more people, which I guess is a leading indicator of more business down the road. Performance in the quarter was a little off from our model, but that's neither here nor there. Is there a way you could take some of the points that you've mentioned and help us from where we sit understand what the cadence on earnings and margin could look like? And for that matter, where the – if your backlog is $1.250 billion, what is the stealth backlog when you look at things that you've won but haven't been necessarily seen committed yet on funding? Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: All right. Thanks. Well, George, a couple of things, and you've been a long-time student of Ball in our Aerospace business, so this may not be surprise you. But number one, you first got to follow the revenue growth and then just look at year-to-date what we've seen in the revenue growth and I think that's terrific. Number two, as you well know, as we start up new contracts that the margin profile of those always starting is lower than when you're finishing if you perform well because what you do is, as you accrue, you buy down the risk. The technological risk subsides and you start to – you're able to accrue more as those programs go on. We have a lot of new programs going and that's why the margin, if you look at just pure margin it's come down. There's nothing in that other than we started a bunch of new projects as we go forward. Lastly with your question, we look at several different metrics. We look at funded backlog, we look at won not booked, which is programs that we have won, but have not been booked, because they haven't been funded. And then we also look at bids and proposals that are outstanding and all of those are at record high for Ball. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the – we're much more constructive on the budget process right now. I know Congress or the House is putting out a tax plan now, but let's not forget both the House and the Senate approved a budget, and I think that's very important because that gets the funding on some of these won not booked. And so I would expect, I don't want – don't pin me down to the exact timing, but I would expect over the six to nine to 12 months that you're going to see an improvement in our backlog, and then you could see continued performance improvement as we translate these new and existing contracts, buy down that risk and perform on them like we typically do.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wanted to go to the – good morning. I wanted to go to the Food segment for a little while. You guys had double-digit declines in food cans.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Right.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And still managed to have an EBIT margin decline of only 10 basis points. I assume some of that is from the closures of Baltimore and Hubbard, Ohio. Some is from the Aerosol contribution or better manufacturing. Can you sort of just quantify the contribution of each in the quarter? And then along those lines, what you think are stable long-term margin would be for this segment?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, let me first by start to say Hubbard and Baltimore we actually sold those facilities. We did not close them and so actually we sold – and they were both profitable. So, actually our results on a apples-to-apples basis, perhaps, might have been even a little bit better than what we suggested. I think really what you're seeing, to answer your question, it's difficult to partial out, because many of our manufacturing facilities are comingled, but what I would tell you is that the projects that we had in place over the last 12 months to close our Weirton, West Virginia facility and bring up the new Canton – or expansion of our existing Canton facility, we had some short-term pains in the first quarter and second quarter. We worked those out and the team has done a very good job and we are getting the benefits that we expected currently. We weren't in the first half of the year, but we are certainly currently. We also – as the Aerosol business continues to grow and it is continuing to grow, I said it's relatively flat around the world. In North America, it was down a little bit. Again, we can't specifically determine why, but I think some of it had to do with these hurricanes, but in Europe was up for us and in India, which is a relatively new plant for us, that is growing very strong. So from a big picture perspective in that segment, as you continue to see our Aerosol business growing and our Food business, which is a small business and getting smaller in that, you should see margin improvement in that business. Right now, I think we're in around the 9% year-to-date. We would expect that to improve. It all has to do with the amount of pass-through of steel and we do expect increases in steel going into next year, which means the margin may look lower, but the overall profitability of that segment ought to improve as we move forward.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, that's great. Thank you. And then just going back to North America, is there any sort of insurance recovery that you can claim for this out-of-pattern freight that could help you in the fourth quarter?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. We're looking into that. The issue is you've got – these are two storms and so we have insurance that covers both downtime in our facilities and then contingent downtime at customers' facilities, but you have to satisfy deductibles in both those. So we're looking it up, but it's probably negligible.
Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good, morning guys. Just a couple of questions that haven't been touched on. First, you talked about the shared service centers, one down in Mexico and one over in Serbia. Could you maybe give us a little color there as to what sorts of activities that you guys have folded in or what you're doing there, what the – how we should think about the opportunity for either cost savings or growth or what have you from those activities?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure. I mean, you could think about everything that doesn't involve making a can in a plant and selling it to a customer, so all the back office processes. They are AP, a lot of planning things, a lot of just back office accounting things.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Payroll.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Payroll. We're looking at – I mean, we have a game plan and we're starting to transition those services from both North America and across Europe into those shared service centers, and that will grow over time. And that's also a part of that three-year plan that we put together when we decided to buy Rexam. So we're on track and, like John said, there's always – there's a lot of work that goes into that to do that. It's not simple and it takes a little bit of time, but we're happy with the progress we've made so far.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And just to give a little color and context. It's not a big bang event that you go from zero to one and just put all those things in. We have new processes, we have new systems, we have new people in place. And so each of those various work streams, as Scott mentioned, in addition to many others, we have a specific game plan of when to roll those out. For example, at the beginning of October, we turned on a payroll system on a global basis for the first time. Are we getting the benefits right now? No, because we're going through the typical debugging issues when you go from a bunch of different systems to one much more standardized system. But now we have people in place in these two shared services to be implementing that and we're able to relieve ourselves of some of the higher costs G&A elsewhere. You're going to see over the next year or so a lot of this, I call it two yards and a cloud of dust, to use the football analogy, because that's what it is. It's hard work, but you're going to see it and it's – we really expect to start to meaningfully see the benefits as we get in the mid to late 2018.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then second question I had for you, Scott, was, I mean, you repeatedly told us that you're on track for where you thought you are in respect of the big plan. Another component of that was we felt when you were within line of sight of that, you've talked about ramping up the share repurchase to kind of be most of cash flow, that kind of being where it's wanted. I did note that it looks like you picked up some share repo here in 3Q, but perhaps not quite to the levels I would have anticipated. Kind of what's the outlook going forward? I mean, do you still – do you feel you're closer to line of sight at this point to kind of ramp up share repurchase or thoughts on capital allocation that way?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think we're right on schedule if not ahead of schedule. In fact, I think, initially, we said we probably wouldn't buy shares in the 2017 and we did. So, in my mind, we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be unless we look at next year and put our plans together in February, to tell you what our plans are for 2018 in terms of share purchase, but I would expect it to be part of our capital distribution.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Right. And the only thing I'd add, we're also mindful we have debt covenants. So as our leverage comes down, we have to make commitments. We're well within that, but we have to be mindful of that. So, we're trying to be good long-term stewards of our capital.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay guys. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So when you announced the Rexam deal, you obviously had a plan in place and you've kind of maintained the $2 billion of EBITDA, $1 billion of free cash flow. But things have changed and the beer market does look like it's pretty soft. So, I just wanted to see if you could give any comments on the growth from today's EBITDA of $1.725 billion or so in 2017 out to the $2 billion. Maybe you can size those buckets of the $275 million incremental, what comes from maybe synergies, market growth, conversion to specialty or anything else that's worth talking about?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, well let me kind of start and ask the others to jump in. Let's start and talk big picture about the various synergies and where we are with them like the footprint. We've announced upwards of $130 million of cost savings through the footprint and we haven't gotten really anything year-to-date. And so that's all on the comp we will start to get in the fourth quarter. Dan mentioned Recklinghausen, Reidsville here in North Carolina in the United States. But then really going into 2018, so that's a big chunk of it. We also announced – on the sourcing side, we announced I think in the first quarter that we expected to slowly start getting it in the second half of this year and as we enter the fourth quarter we'll start to accelerate, but we're really going to get the full-year benefit of that in 2018. And then on the SG&A side, I just mentioned that, through our shared services that we expect to get a kind of half of our original expectations, but it won't be coming till mid to late 2018. You add all that up and you quickly see how we've gotten some good synergies. Now it's been the SG&A, we've gotten some sourcing, and you can see in the progression, but really going into the fourth quarter and going into 2018 you're going to get a lion share of that. You layer that on top of Aerospace growth that I talked about before, you lay it on top of the growth capital that Dan talked about and whether it's the new plant we have in Spain, what we're doing here in North America, some other regions as well, and that's why we remain confident of getting to $2 billion by the end of 2019.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And just, I guess, your initial comment on things have changed relative to beer, I would say from a demand standpoint nothing has changed appreciably from our investment thesis, with the exception of EMEA has been a little bit more volatile than we anticipated heading in.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's helpful.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: But Big Beer is on its – Big Beer has been on a constant decline over the last two to three years and that's why we've invested heavily in craft and other segments to offset that.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. And then, just as a followup there. Is there any way that – what's your plans for growth, continued growth in Mexico and Brazil? I mean, would you consider – are there opportunities for further kind of footprint growth if that were to be possible?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I think we've said historically, you think of Mexico in two different markets, right? The one that's export into the U.S. which we're a big player in and then since the deal we've acquired our Queretaro facility, which really handles both CSD and the local beer. That's been slower growth over the last year because of the FX dynamics and the impact to the end consumer in the domestic beer market. But we have stayed ahead and we've been working very closely with the two biggest brewers for the export business and we've continued to stay ahead from an investment standpoint. We built the Monterrey facility for three lines. We do have a third line that is running right now, and so I think we'll continue to respond to the growth of the big customers in and around the U.S. marketplace. That's really where our focus has been. Where there are other opportunities and when the Mexican domestic market comes back and grows at that 6% to 8%, there will probably be opportunities for us, but right now we're laser focused on keeping up with the demand of our existing customers into the U.S. marketplace.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Brazil, any footprint?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And in South America, there's been – there's really a big movement afoot from – moving from returnable glass into the can as we mentioned and we've expanded our Argentina facility. We've continued to add capacity where it makes sense into Brazil. And so, again, we're going to continue to stay ahead of that. We're in close contact with the big customers there. So, I would expect that you would continue to see some capital going to work for organic growth opportunities in those two markets in particular.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed with your question.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: This is more for Scott, I suppose. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something on the bridge of where the free cash flow for the year is going to stay relatively the same, even though it looks like the CapEx is up a bit and the net debt is going to end the year a couple hundred million higher than what you said last quarter. So, could you help me bridge that, please?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, the bridge in the debt has to do with really FX rates and we bought a little bit of stock in the third quarter that hadn't been in the numbers before. So, that's why the debt is up. And then the – on the cash flow side, we're getting working capital benefit sooner than what we had initially anticipated, so that's offsetting the CapEx increase and it's offsetting what we bought back.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And as we look at 2018 and 2019, how much more capital – sorry, working capital benefit, I guess you'd say, or cash used, will it be a source in those years? What would be a good guess to use for our models?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think it's really too early to tell. Our folks have been incredibly creative and aggressive at managing our working capital year-to-year. And so I think at this point it's a little too premature to talk about 2018 and 2019, but we're on track to hit our 2019 goals for cash flow.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then last question, I guess more for John is, you mentioned that CapEx might be a touch lower in 2018 or 2019, like around $500 million, which of course does include a lot of growth capital in there. So, I guess it's safe to say that as we go through next year there'll be more lines probably planned at least to be under construction in those years or one of those years?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, yeah. What I said was the $500 million was the original placeholder when we announced the transaction and it included $250 million of growth capital. As time goes on, you get more specific plans around that and we'll adjust up or down. Dan had mentioned that in Mexico we've been investing to keep ahead of the demand. Down in South America, we have some opportunities. We'll let you all know when it's appropriate, but I think that as a placeholder it may be a little bit more like we're doing this year. Some of that's pulling ahead. But as opportunities come forward, and we think they're good projects, we're compensated to earn returns in excess of 9% on that. And if we think we can do it, we're going to do it.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. That's great.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question...
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay.
Operator: ...comes from the line of – oh, I'm sorry, I apologize.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No. Please go ahead, Jennifer.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank Please proceed with your question.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for letting me get my question in here. Two questions, one quick one on Europe and then just one follow-up on Brazil. Even in Europe if I adjust for the lower G&A sequentially, your margin still expanded. Could you just talk about what you saw there quarter-over-quarter? What kind of improvements you're seeing in that business?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, Debbie, I think I might have mentioned it earlier, but the quick summary is we've had volume growth of 2%, 2.5%. We've had good cost and efficiencies at the plant level. We really haven't benefited from any of the strategic moves we made, although we start to in the fourth quarter and we also inherited some contracts that had lower year-over-year pricing. So that's been a bit of a headwind. So despite all that, we've been up and been able to improve margins.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just on Brazil. Just bear with me for a second here because there are a lot of questions on this and you made that comment earlier in the prepared remarks. My sense is that the industry should see demand in Brazil at about 26 billion cans at the end of this year. And my math kind of suggests that the industry next year would operate a little over 90% if you see some growth, maybe a little under if you don't. Is that fair to say and is that considered balanced in your view? Are there any kind of regional nuances that we should think about because you haven't actually seen a decent amount of capacity flowing in, in the last year and this is the only can plant I think that's just coming in next year, so I'm just trying to get a sense of what the real risk is here?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think in real short summary, it's the regional nuances that occur here. Brazil is such a large country. Its supply chain is very different and its transportation is very different than what you see in more developed markets, and so it really is a region by region. And where the new capacity is coming in, we have facilities there and there has been some growth, which has been helpful. But the question that Dan alluded to is, is it enough growth to offset some regional supply demand imbalances and it's premature to tell. The only thing Dan was signaling is that the competitors' plant we understand is up and running now. And so it does create a little bit of headwind.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one on Europe. I mean, yes, we are seeing some margin improvement, but it still lags your segments. But where do you see margins growing over the next year or two in that segment?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, what we said is at – about a year ago, we said that we believe that there's 250 basis points of margin improvement in that business, but it will take some time. And we now – we closed at the end of July, early August the Recklinghausen, Germany facility. We really haven't seen that much of benefits of that and so you're going to start to see that with some other things in terms of G&A, the shared service concept that we talked about earlier. It's Europe and you have to work through Union. You have to work through Works Council and it just takes longer than what you would like to do, but we've got a three-year game plan to get back to the margins that we think ought to be achievable in Europe.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And one last one on interest expense. Like what's driving the higher number? I think last quarter you have said about $280 million and now it's $290 million. Like what's driving that incremental $10?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. The debt is a little higher.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It's currency.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, and currency.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Jennifer, assuming there's no other questions, we should probably finish up.
Operator: We do have a follow-up question.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Why don't we take one more?
Operator: Very good. Our question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your follow-up question.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-on. I'll make it quick, guys. Number one, John, we saw how the custom can help the soft drink business grow value at retail and grow volume. Are the mega beer producers considering at all using some of these sizes to maybe stimulate growth as well or is it really kind of a mismatch of package type with the bread and butter consumer for that product? And then, if you can remind us in terms of cash outlays for the restructuring, should we expect there'll be – and integration, excuse me, higher in 2018 versus 2017 on par, if you can remind us what the numbers are there, would appreciate. Thanks again, guys. Good luck in the quarter.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I think, George, from an innovation standpoint, yes. And how? I think the Big Beer folks are being a little more thoughtful in terms of initializing innovation in different can sizes around a brand, to your point. Some brands, it's important for innovation. I think one of the faster growing products in the U.S. market, you'll see it, but I think two of them you'll see them in sleek cans. So it's out there, it's a foot. And obviously in many instances, where there is success, there are followers. So I would anticipate a lot more conversations in around there, and not just in the U.S., all around the world where actually the sleek can is the can that is initially launched in some markets around the world, a Vietnam, a Brazil, et cetera. So I think you're on to something there and there are a lot of conversations happening in and around that, so probably more to come on that.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Cash?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And on the cash side of restructuring, yes, more of the cash will go out in 2018 from some of the actions that we've already announced.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Thank you, George. Jennifer, we could wind up, please?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good rest of your day, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 3, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you, Malika, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2017 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding descriptions of our segment reporting, year-to-date depreciation catch-up recorded in the second quarter that relates to the finalization of the fixed asset values associated with last year's beverage acquisition, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And also, we are welcoming Dan Fisher to our quarterly earnings calls. Dan assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business late last year, and he's doing a fantastic job leading this. Given where we are and where we are going, we thought it's important for you to hear from him on many of the activities that are occurring in this business. I'll provide some brief introductory remarks and comments on our food and aerosol segment. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the back half of 2017 and beyond. Our second quarter results from operations were right on top of our expectations despite challenging U.S. tinplate performance. Volumes in our U.S. food can business declined low double digits in the quarter, and tinplate manufacturing inefficiencies led to lower absorption and redundant costs in the quarter related to the closure of our Weirton, West Virginia cutting and coating facility and contemporaneous startup of our new Canton, Ohio cutting and coating facility. We're disappointed about the performance we experienced in this segment. However, we believe the underperformance is behind us and expect each of the remaining quarters for our food and aerosol business to be up year over year due to the incremental progress we've seen at our Canton metal service center, improving manufacturing metrics, and the ramping up of new aluminum aerosol capacity in Europe and India to keep up with our customers' growth. Supply and demand is very tight in the global aluminum aerosol business, and our team is living hand-to-mouth during the second quarter, lending support across regions to one another as they tried to keep pace with the expansion of our highly sustainable and lightweight ReAl product line. Going forward, we will continue to generate cash from our tinplate operations and continue to invest in our growing global aerosol business. I'll let Dan Fisher review the global beverage can business in a moment. However, one year into the largest acquisition in our company's history, we are seeing the growth in comparable EBITDA and free cash flow materialize in global beverage. Initial transformational actions are driving synergies and cash flow is on the rise. We're not without our challenges, particularly in some of the more volatile regions in which we operate, but our three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, are all on track, so far so good. Combining the expected improvement in both food and aerosol and our continued progress in global beverage, and then layer on current and expected growth in our aerospace business over the next several years, and we remain confident in our team's ability to deliver on our commitments while behaving as owners to ensure the best long-term outcomes for our company. With Dan, Jim Peterson, and Rob Strain at the helm of these businesses, we're in very good shape. To highlight some of the work being done during the second quarter, we further improved our G&A cost structure with the ramp down of the Charlotte, North Carolina, regional support center. We ceased beverage can production in Reidsville, North Carolina. We negotiated with the Works Councils in Recklinghausen, Germany and ceased production of beverage cans and end in those facilities on July 31. We saw month-on-month improvement at our Canton, Ohio metal service center. And our aerospace business cleared critical program milestones, hired more staff to service contracts that will ramp up through the second half of 2017, and stayed on time and on budget with facility expansions. Our multiyear value capture plans are on course. And as previously mentioned, we expect to recognize $150 million of the expected synergies by the end of 2017. And balance sheet optimization programs are producing benefits equal to or better than our expectations. Our plans for 2017 and beyond are right on track to capture planned cost savings and grow comparable EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA in all of our businesses. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. It's a real pleasure to join the earnings calls and have the opportunity to highlight all the very good work being executed by our global teams. I want to recognize Carlos Medeiros, who moved from our South America operations to replace me here in North and Central America, and Carlos Pires, who took over for Carlos in South America. We have high expectations for both gentlemen and are excited to have them in these new roles. As John said, we're pleased with our second quarter results. Pro forma global beverage can volumes grew in the quarter. The beverage can is winning in traditional and craft beer, sparkling water, energy drinks, teas and wine, and we're leveraging our industry leadership role to further position the can as the most sustainable package from an environmental, social, and economic perspective for our customers, consumers, and communities. Our North America volumes grew just over 2%, largely driven by imported beer demand, growth in craft and sparkling water, and consumer demand for smaller sizes of their favorite traditional beverages. And in South America, John and Scott mentioned on the first quarter call that the South America team was feeling much more constructive about the market, and it materialized. In the second quarter, our South America segment volume grew 4%, with Brazil being up in the low single digits and continued growth in other South American countries. The European business saw growth of approximately 1%, which was in line with industry demand. Demand for sleek cans continued, and our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track. We still have much to work on in terms of improving the margins in the business, and it will take some time. However, we have a variety of initiatives, both near and long term, we are executing on that will help bridge the gap between the business we acquired and our expectations for this segment over the next couple years. The €40 million annualized cost savings from the recent Recklinghausen closures is a very good start, and we have a variety of other initiatives underway to make the business more competitive from a cost and flexibility perspective. You may have noticed in the release financials that the contribution from our equity investments grew quarter over quarter. The acquired beverage can JVs in Guatemala, Panama, and South Korea, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV and our Vietnam investment all performed well in the quarter due to better volume and mix. We are not without our challenges, including the political and economic unrest in Turkey and Egypt and the carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia that are hurting consumer demand in that region. In the second quarter, our China volumes were flat versus the market growing at roughly 6%. With China's overcapacity situation, Ball has and will continue to exercise a disciplined approach. Despite these regional challenges, the managers in these regions and the entire global beverage organization is executing at a very high level, and every division is on track to increase the EVA dollars being generated on the invested capital they have employed. Our global beverage sales, engineering, innovation, manufacturing, and finance teams have a roadmap lined with initiatives to leverage our specialty portfolio to existing and new customers, foster best practice sharing and process improvement, and drive innovation while optimizing our plant networks and existing equipment. In summary, our global beverage business posted strong results, and everyone is laser-focused on keeping this momentum going, meeting demand and effectively managing their invested capital base to drive EVA dollar growth. We're right on track in the next wave of transformational work to ensure we are fit from a supply/demand, cost, and flexibility perspective we'll accelerate in the second half of 2017. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, Dan, and welcome to the calls going forward. Comparable second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.53, which includes expense of $0.04 for the 2017 first quarter catch-up and additional second quarter depreciation related to the finalization of the fair values and useful lives for the assets acquired in the Rexam acquisition versus last year's $0.52, which was right on top of our plan prior to the final acquisition accounting getting recorded. To keep the update as simple as possible, I would add $11 million of depreciation per quarter and making the offsetting change to segment earnings with $8 million per quarter in Europe and $1 million each quarter in North America, South America, and other for EMEA. Refer to Note 4 of the press release financials for further explanation and catch-up depreciation reconciliation as of June 30, 2017. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of last year's beverage can acquisition and solid operational performance in both beverage and aerospace. These benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher share count. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q. Net debt ended the quarter at $7.1 billion, which is right on top of our plan and a decrease of $300 million since the end of the first quarter, due to strong operational performance and working capital management despite our normal seasonal working capital build. The debt will continue to come down as we move through the back half of the year. At current FX rates and given our euro debt exposure, our year-end net debt will likely trend closer to $6.3 billion, but this will not impede our plan to return value to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends during the second half. As we think about the remainder of 2017, nearly all of our previously communicated goals remain intact. We expect full-year 2017 comparable EBITDA in the range of $1.75 billion, free cash flow to be in excess of $850 million after spending in excess of $500 million of CapEx. Post-split, the full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 will be closer to 359 million shares excluding the impact and timing of any share repurchases. Full-year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. The full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 26%, and corporate undistributed will be in the range of $140 million for full-year 2017. And as I mentioned earlier, year-end net debt could be at the higher end of the $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion range due to the strength of the euro. The cash is really showing up and we feel really good about where we are at midyear. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved second quarter results, driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. The team cleared a couple of significant program milestones in some big programs during the quarter. And even though the contracted backlog is down slightly, please don't read anything into that, as the U.S. government has not been making decisions on outstanding proposals as it continues to focus on other priorities and backfill open decision-making positions in the various defense and intelligence communities. Our aerospace business is winning in the marketplace, and we'll see a nice step up in the segment earnings year over year during the second half. Now as we look forward, we are on track to achieve the financial benefits from the acquisition. Our aerospace business is hiring people at a rapid clip to staff the work won to date, and our food and aerosol team has a mandate to attack costs and improve manufacturing efficiencies to the Ball standards that we expect. As Scott mentioned, our 2017 comparable EBITDA and free cash flow goals are intact and will be driven by global beverage demand, synergies, and aggressively managing the balance sheet. By 2019, we continue to believe that we can generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. When we announced our intentions to acquire Rexam, we said that we would rapidly delever, capture synergies, spend necessary growth capital on high-returning projects, and then return our remaining free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and that is exactly what we are doing. And with that, Malika, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And our first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Good morning, thanks for taking my question and all the details. Congratulations on the progress. I guess I wanted to drill into the guidance a bit to see if there are any subtleties that we should be mindful of over the rest of the year. So I think in the last investor conference, Scott, you said EBITDA would be $1.750 billion-plus. In this press release, it's in the range. And the 20% to 30% EPS growth target hasn't, I don't think, been explicitly mentioned. I'm guessing issues in EMEA, food cans, and obviously the depreciation increase are some factors that are maybe weighing on the guidance. But if you could affirm that or correct anything that's wrong there, I'd appreciate it, and then I had a couple of follow-ons.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah, no, George, I think you have it exactly right. If you look across the businesses and the performance, North and Central America, Europe, South America are all on track, as well as China and aerospace. Food is trailing our expectations, and EMEA is a more volatile region, and right now they're experiencing some tougher times. Given that and the $90 million of additional depreciation and non-yield-related amortization, I think we'll be below that 20% to 30% EPS range that we gave, but above our long-term goals. And our focus has always been on driving cash and EVA dollars, and we're doing great on those fronts. So that's the story, I think you have it exactly.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, Scott. And, Scott, just you said above the low end of the 20% to 30% goal, did I hear that correctly?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. I said below the 20% to 30%, but above our long-term range.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Our long-term goal is that 10% to 15%.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood, thank you for that. And then, Dan, I guess welcome to the call as well, some questions for you, to the extent that you can comment. Realizing EMEA is volatile and therefore by definition is going to be hard to project, are you seeing any change in trends early in the quarter that would suggest some improvement? And then to the degree that you've been working on this, how are you finding the company's ability to sell complexity and generate a return from selling the complexity to your customers, any willingness for them to use a more sophisticated and more complex packaging mix in the future?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I would say, and I'll ask John to maybe comment on the second part of that. But for EMEA in particular, in Saudi relative to the carbonation tax, we've seen different sorts of tax and different sorts of revenue grabs from governments in the past, and there's always a short-term inflection point until you can work through exactly that impact in terms of substrate mix, pack size, and supply chain or retail prices. And there hasn't been – here we are, three, four weeks into the third quarter. I haven't seen significant change to what we experienced in June. Keep in mind that tax went into effect basically the first week of June, so it's still very early. But historically, whether it's sugar taxes or anything along these lines, we see the demand profile come back in markets like the Middle East, where we like the long-term and mid-term trajectory.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And, George, to answer your question about the customers and profit pools, I think that's where you're really going, yes, we continue to see our customers using our containers, particularly on the specialty side, to change the profit pool opportunities that they have in front of them. And whether it's soft drink here in North America, whether it's beer both large and small in South America and even Europe, we continue to see that. And we continue from a – from our position, we continue to try and push that because I think it's important that we're driving value and volume into our customers, because if we can help them with the price points that they have and improve their profitability, it's better for the can and it's better for Ball Corporation.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, I will turn it over. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks, everyone, just, Scott, one on the cash flow guidance. Obviously, you're getting better working capital. Can you just talk about what exactly has improved along those lines, what your working capital expectation has changed by, and how sustainable whatever those improvements are?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure, I think as we move through the year, it's been really fun to see the alignment and energy all of our teams have in getting after, whether it's managing inventories, payable terms, receivables. Having EVA as our primary financial metric is a powerful tool. And if you get people aligned around that and what it means in the different levers you can pull, it's fun to see what our folks, whether it's treasury, sourcing, operations, legal, IT, all working together to drive the improvement. So we're seeing it really across the board, and we're six months into this year and feel better about the cash flow that will show up this year.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is there any particular bucket that you would focus on, receivables, payables, inventories?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: It really is, Adam, across the board and it's in different geographies and different opportunities. What's exciting to see is leaving no stone unturned. So I think we're going to see nice benefits this year, and more of that will flow into 2018 as well.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think just to give you context, let's just focus on the inventory for a moment. The demand side of our business has been good in those three main regions. We have had, as Dan said, some volatility in some of the other regions. But the ability to use our system as a network and the plant floor systems that we've talked about and being able to optimize the days on hand of not only raw coils, but also finished goods, and having better capability, being able to predict the demand profile of our customers, that all helps drive down inventories. On the receivables, we've done some creative things with some of our customers to help drive the DSO down in there. And then on the payables side, we've been working with our suppliers too, so it really is all across the board.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks, and just a couple others, one on European beverage margins. If I add back the $16 million of additional depreciation, margins would still have been quite a bit lower than a year ago, appreciating that the asset mix has changed. Were those margins ex the higher depreciation as you were expecting? And if so, why were they so much lower than last year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes, they are in line with expectation. I think we've commented on this. The business that we acquired had a different capability mix and in line with that is a different profitability mix. We're changing both the flexibility and the capabilities in Europe. I think the first step was closure of a high-cost, basically obsolete capability footprint in Recklinghausen. So if you add that back to your first half run rate that we experienced this year, you're getting a lot closer to where we had been historical. And as I said in my comments, we're not done yet. It just takes a little longer given Works Council constraints and things of this nature from a structural standpoint, but we're right in line with where we think.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, and one just on Brazil. Two of the biggest brewers were both down in the quarter, in one case high single digits, and then one of them said the beer market was down almost 3% in the quarter, yet the can makers and the bottle makers were all up in the quarter. Can you help me understand why there might have been this disconnect between the packagers' volume and the brewers' volume in Brazil?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yes, the actual literage consumption for the brewers was down roughly 3% in the market. And so for us, again, we continue to experience the benefit from substrate penetration on can versus returnable glass. And then depending on which customer you're looking at, they all had a different success story, as they always do from quarter to quarter, just depending on the promotional activity. So we benefited from mix and we benefited from the can and the penetration against returnable glass.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'll just add on to that, but Dan raised a very good point because while overall literage was down, we've seen smaller pack sizes on the can go into Brazil at a higher rate than some of the larger sizes, so that's one thing. On the glass, obviously we're not in the glass business. We shouldn't comment on it, but we do know that Dan had said that the can is up while the overall beer market was down.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, John and Dan. I appreciate it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good. How are you?
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good, good. I just wanted to ask. How does the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar impact your EBITDA and free cash flow outlook for 2017 versus prior guidance? And then given the lowered EBITDA guidance for 2017, how does this change the timeline for your ability to deliver on the targeted $2 billion in EBITDA for 2019?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Let me just jump out ahead of that and Scott can talk about the euro, but I want to be clear here. A year ago, when we gave out those ranges of free cash flow and EBITDA, we said that if things go our way and we get some tailwind that we're going to be at the upper part of that range. And if we start to encounter some headwinds, we could be at the lower end of the range. We talked about the three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, all doing well and on track, and aerospace as well. Where we've been having our challenges, quite frankly, is on the food and aerosol side, where we are down year to date when we expected to be up, and that's not an immaterial amount. We expect it to get better, but we've got to get some giddy-up on the manufacturing side of that business. And then on the EMEA side, Dan just talked about the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia. There has been a 40% increase in retail price points in Egypt because of the devaluation. Those are material headwinds to us. And despite that, we still think that we're going to be in the $1.175 billion range on EBITDA. As it translates into cash, it gets down to, you have to look at interest expense and all those things that mutes some of the impact on the euro exchange and a lot of the working capital and just running our balance sheet much more efficiently with this combined organization. That's where we're getting the benefit there. So with that, Scott, if you want to say anything more about the euro?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, those are the big drivers. The euro has a bit of a benefit from an operating earnings standpoint, but like John said, it's got negatives too in terms of leverage, interest expense, and other things. So net-net, the business is pretty much in line with what we would expect absent some of the softness that we're seeing in a couple segments, and the performance we're generating is on track and cash flow is ahead.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And we expect to – the synergies plans are on track, and we expect to accelerate those plans in the second half, as we said in our earnings release.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's understandable and very helpful. And then given all the concern over the Brazilian economy's health, can you describe the South American intra-quarter trends by month for the second quarter? And then how has this region performed thus far during the third quarter?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Typically we're not going to get into that. Quite candidly, I don't think it's helpful because every region has a level of volatility, and certainly South America does when you think about politically what's going on there. But what we've seen is steady progress despite economic and political difficulty down there. As you know, the second quarter and even the third quarter are seasonally slow quarters. And I don't off the top of my head have month to month and I don't think it would be relevant anyway. But the can, we wish it was stronger, quite honestly, but to be up a few percent in a seasonally slow quarter in a place where the economic and political discord continues, we'll take that. It's a little bit better than what we had anticipated six months ago.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. That's it for me, thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, thank you. I just had some questions on the closures. I guess I know you mentioned the €40 million for Recklinghausen. Could you just – I don't know if you've given updates for the savings from Reidsville and Charlotte. I think if you could, also just remind us in terms of when the savings from those closures should start to show up.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Both of those facilities closed at the tail end of the second quarter. And as you said, the €40 million, that's been guidance given. And at our Analyst Day in December, we commented that typically a closure in North America and/or Europe, if it's a reasonably sized can plant, it's in the $25 million to $35 million range, and it's going to be right in that range.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: For Reidsville?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then for those three, in Q3 and beyond is when those savings should start to flow through?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Usually it would be – because remember, Recklinghausen, for example, didn't stop producing until the end of July. And when you close a plant, there's always a couple months thereafter where you get some kind of cost tail, if you want to call it that. So I would think about Reidsville will get a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit in the fourth quarter. Recklinghausen is probably more fourth quarter, but more importantly it's 2018 and beyond.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then just South America, and I know the year-over-year comparables aren't great, but I guess margins are strong and equal to the seasonally stronger fourth quarter levels of a year ago. So I don't know if you can comment on what's driving those margins and how you think about them, if they continue to improve as you go into the stronger second half.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: We talked about this before. It's unfair to look at that because it's an apple and a pear, because we have a network now. In the past, we only had several plants, and so the on-season versus off-season fluctuation in margins was greater because when you're spreading your G&A and your fixed costs over a smaller amount of plants, it just becomes more volatile. When you have a network of 13 plants all throughout South America, it becomes a little bit more consistent. Obviously, we just lapped the 12 months of the acquisition, so I think as we go forward that will become more clear as you see looking forward.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great, and then just final question, Scott, just on the working capital. I think previously you said better than $100 million. I don't know if you have any updated forecast for that number.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: It will be better than $100 million, and we think the total free cash flow will be better than $850 million.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right, great. Thanks very much.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: There are a bunch of other puts and takes. That's why I'm not giving you a specific answer.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Just following up on Tyler's question, I'm wondering if at this stage there are any other footprint optimizations that you're looking at or anything that we could expect going forward there as you look at these markets as they've evolved over the last year or so.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: In December of last year, when we had our Investor Day, we did talk about that we have a multi-year program, Dan, to look at and optimizing our footprint from a cost and flexibility point of view, and none of that has changed. Dan talked about, even in Europe, Recklinghausen allows us to get more flexibility and take a high-cost plant out. We think there are more opportunities like that going forward, and we've also said that our plans are going to be accelerating at this point in time as we go into the second half. And so conceptually, we're continuing to look at these things all the time.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And in the past, you've talked about getting back into the market in the share repurchase program as you get more of a line of sight to the leverage metrics that you're targeting. I guess relative to last quarter's call, has that timing in your mind been pushed out or pulled forward, or is it still roughly the same?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We always said, as we got better line of sight in the second half of the year, and we're in the second half of the year and I think we have better line of sight, so I would expect it right on plan with what we thought we were going to do before.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, I appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: John, you talked about challenges in U.S. tinplate and the operational headwinds as you transition out of Weirton and start up Canton. Is it possible to quantify how much of a hit those transition costs were in the quarter relative to your initial expectations?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'd hesitate a bit because then you play left pocket-right pocket, but what I can tell you is we expected the second quarter to be flat to up relative to year over year, and we were not. And the vast majority of that was related to cost inefficiencies.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then at the Analyst Day, you discussed commercial opportunities that could create value in excess of the synergies, and I'm just wondering. In the time since the Analyst Day, as you've spoken with customers, how's the commercial opportunities playing out relative to your expectations? Are there are any early wins that you can point to in terms of packages that are gaining acceptance or a new offering, or is this maybe a little bit more of a longer-term process?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, it definitely is a longer-term process. And recall at the Investor Day, what we talked about is – I mentioned even earlier on this call about profit pools and improving the profit pools. There's a wide variety of ways you can do that. Obviously, different can sizes, price, tighter call-offs, ordering call-offs with our customers. There's a whole host of things. To answer to your question directly, is on the specialty side, back not six months ago I think we told the world that in North America we were making – and don't hold me to this – but approximately 25 different types of cans. We're at 30 now. We're at 30 because we continue to see growth in the opportunities of really differentiating on behalf – for our customers and on behalf of our customers, I would tell you, so we're having some good success there. And the standard 12-ounce containers on a global basis, as you know, that's a very competitive spot where we compete with others. We're trying to be leaders in that, but you also have to be realistic, and I think it's much more longer term. As contracts come up, we have to recognize the regional supply and demand and the regional competitive dynamics of that. But on the standard containers, it is more competitive. But as I said on the specialty, we're seeing more and more opportunities. You just have to be a hunter for them.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Dan, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about what you saw in the second quarter in terms of a seasonal pickup in Russia and the Nordic region. I think when you bought Rexam, you said that there was a more pronounced seasonal pattern there.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yeah, we saw – and I think we commented in the first quarter, we were slightly down year over year, but it's not a robust quarter in terms of volume in terms of the seasonality. And we were about mid-single digits up in Russia in the second quarter, so right in line or a little bit ahead of where we thought. The business is performing well. They're right on track, really no news to report there.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then you really hinted at potentially more footprint adjustment in Europe. And I'm always conscious that in a lot of countries in Europe, things are not as flexible from a labor standpoint as maybe we have here in North America. And I wondered if you're seeing any challenges with that that are different than you might have expected.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: The challenges are consistent with what we've experienced historically when we've done this. I think in my prepared comments, as the market leader, we're constantly looking at supply/demand balance how we have historically. We're looking at market opportunities because there are parts of Europe that continue to grow. And we've made the comments on our investments in Spain, and we continue to see growth in areas like Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. So we'll continue to make sure that our footprint is fit for purpose to capture the growth and benefit our customers and attack those profit pools, as John mentioned. And there may be changes to the footprint in order to get that.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then the last question I had, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the last couple of quarters whether we're seeing any signs of improvement in China, and I wondered if you could comment on that.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: The short answer is there's no facts that we can point to that says there has been meaningful improvement in China in terms of the oversupply situation. I think anecdotally and from a tone perspective, it feels more constructive. But it's premature to declare any kind of victory there. We do know that the can market continues to grow, particularly on the beer side, but you're also seeing more can penetration in alternative drinks, whether it's herbal teas or energy drinks, et cetera. We know that very little if any new capacity has been brought on stream, and so we've slowly been whittling away at that overcapacity. As we look out several years, it's up to us to be able to try and push some of these new categories because that's going to create the incremental demand that will soak up the excess capacity. So while nothing meaningful has changed as we see it here right now, I think our tone as we look out over the next three years feels a little bit better today than it did say six or nine months ago.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys, a question for Scott. The free cash flow generation for this year is obviously looking pretty strong, and a big part of that sounds like it's working capital savings this year. Do you view the upside of your finding in working capital this year more of a pull-forward from 2018, or are you just finding just a larger basket of opportunities over that three-year horizon you've talked about?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think it's probably a bit of both, Phil. I think we've gotten after a lot of different programs, and they're coming to fruition probably a little quicker than what we initially expected, but I think we're also finding broader pockets of opportunity to go after. So I don't think it's necessarily just stealing from 2018 into 2017. I think the total pool will be bigger over time as well.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess on the food can business, did you see any increased competition, because it did seem like you walked away from a little business during the quarter? How should we think about your volume trajectory in the back half assuming a normal pack?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It's a good question. No, we did not see any meaningful competitive pressure. Let me talk about the volume declines because I think it's important to parse out. There are really three fundamental things that led to the food can declines. Number one, there was some timing with some customers that I wouldn't read into too much. We typically quarter to quarter have timing issues of this, and it actually was a headwind to us in this quarter, but we expect to make it up. Another one, we have a large customer experimenting with an alternative substrate. And it's premature to say if that's going good or bad and it's not for us to do that, but that really started to hit us. It's not in the traditional fruit and vegetable categories that we talk about, so that was a hit. And I would expect certainly through the balance of this year that we're going to continue in that specific situation that volumes are going to be a bit soft as they experiment with this alternative substrate. And then we have another large customer in the private label area that's been experiencing their own difficulties, which has been impactful. So what I would tell you is, as we sit here right now, we've got a headwind in a couple of different things, one of them meaning the timing of it I would not worry about, but the other two that we are keeping our eye on. And we expect volumes to be down, but there is no competitive issue relative to other food can suppliers.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Got you. And then just from an operations standpoint, you certainly have some issues. Do you expect to get back on track in the back half outside of volumes on the food business? And longer term, do you need to do more cost takeout, just given the fact that volume has been a little weaker than expected?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes and yes, and what I mean by that is we were investing in new technology in our Canton, Ohio facility, and that was coming up at the same time that we were shutting down our Weirton, West Virginia facility. And what happened was we ended up not coming up in Canton nearly as fast as we were expecting to or would have liked, and that created the redundant cost. That is largely behind us. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the second half, the quarter-over-quarter improvement to start showing up on that. In terms of your longer term, this is a business that structurally is not growing, and you have to recognize what it is and who you are. I mentioned that we're running that business for cash, and we continue to have opportunities to take out costs. Let's not forget though, however, even though year to date we're down a little bit, we expect to be up quarter over quarter. The margins in that business are not terrible. It still generates returns in excess of our cost of capital. It doesn't generate returns at our 9% after-tax threshold, but we see a line of sight of being able to get to that. And that's where the additional longer-term cost takeout will continue to occur.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful, and just the last one from me. In your press release, you guys alluded to investing to accelerate synergy capture in 2018 and beyond. Can you just expand a little bit on that? And any color on how we should think about seeing that flow through, is that more of a 2018 event or more of a 2019 event? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think it's a little bit of both, and I think it's premature to talk about that. I think if you go back and read the transcript of the call in its entirety, you'll get a sense of the various areas we're looking at. We talked about G&A. We talked about footprint. We talked about commercial. We talked about plant floor systems and the operating side of it. So I think it's all – and we're right on track relative to what we thought. We knew it would take some time, particularly in Europe, as Dan alluded to, on certain initiatives. We knew it would take some time to transfer some of the G&A, and now we're focused on reducing that G&A. And so all the plans that we talked about at this time last year are largely coming to fruition.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Ball Corporation (sic) [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, this is Debbie, and it's actually Deutsche Bank. I wonder if you'd just go back to Europe. I know it's been addressed a couple of times here. And you can put the numbers around the closure, but it seems to me like there's just a lot of opportunity from switching from the Rexam business model to the Ball business model. Can you talk about, now you've had this for about a year, what are the main priorities or things that you need to get done beyond the right-sizing of the footprint that you think can be done?
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: I think there we – keep in mind, in our legacy Ball European business, we made some investments to create capabilities in line with innovation and customer needs to help attack those profit pools, as John said. I think the historical Rexam business did less of that, and so that's what we're attempting to address in our footprint changes. That's principally the biggest thing is to innovate and have capabilities that are fit for the market and the growth and profit pools.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: The other things obviously we're working on is, as Dan said, from a cost perspective, the optimization of that manufacturing is the most important. But there's a bunch of surrounding G&A that remember back – Debbie, you'll remember this. Back in 2013 plus or minus at Ball, we went through and we reorganized ourselves within Europe to go from a regional structure where we had four and five pools of G&A to a centralized that had one European G&A. We are doing the same thing right now, and that affects all the back-office support things, and we have a shared center office that we've opened up in Belgrade, Serbia that we're going to be moving a lot of the transactional processing to that, and there's a whole host of other things. But Dan is right. The most important is get the cost of goods sold line right. Then also the other thing that we haven't talked about which is important the way we think about this is really leveraging the specialty and growing the specialty and creating those profit pools for our customers where we have much more of an emphasis on that than the business we acquired historically did.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then my second and last question on Brazil – or LatAm, you've had this business now for a year. And I think it's been a little hard to determine over on this side the seasonality of that business given its reporting and has before. So could you speak to how the production schedule shifts in the back half of the year? And then part of my conclusion when I look at that is that you should see a higher roll-through if you're getting the synergies in the back half just given that that is a bigger part of the season for you on an annual basis.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: So it's similar to our previous business. I think we've commented previously publicly that it's a heavier weight to the second half, two-thirds/one-third. It might be closer to 60:40, but somewhere in that range. So you should expect higher volumes in the second half as the ramp up for peak season, and then the peak season really hits in Q4.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think, Debbie, when you look at the seasonality, the business we have now is not different than the business we used to have. It's just bigger, and that's what Dan is alluding to.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: Yes.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's fair. Thank you, I'll turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: All right. Thanks, Debbie.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Folks, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, we can.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. So I hit the wrong mute button there. I wanted to just center around two things. First, when we think about – Scott, you answered earlier getting back into the repurchase element. But my question is if we look at where your long-term targets are, $2 billion-ish of EBITDA should come as a run rate out of 2019, essentially you'll be at your leverage targets as you improve the business. Do you feel like you want to reduce a little bit along the way, or can you essentially shift gears into repurchase mode from here on a go-forward basis?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: What we said originally was that we'll get line of sight to get our leverage down to 3.5 times. That's when we would start buying back stock. So I think you'll see – we've got more deleveraging to go this year, but we see line of sight to get down into that range by the end of the year, and there will be more cash flow and deleveraging next year. but we'll be opportunistic about it. I saw this morning before I came in here, it looked like it was on sale, so stay tuned.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Chris, I'll just add onto that. Forget about the journal entries of all the accounting that goes around the acquisition. This is a great cash generative business, full stop. Nothing has changed by that, and it's very consistent in terms of its cash generation capability. That's why a year ago we said with confidence that we are going to integrate these companies. We're going to drive the synergies. We're going to flow cash. And in the absence of good investments, and we've had some good investments and will continue to, we're going to give it back. Nothing has changed in that perspective. And we have a line of sight. As Scott said, we said once we have a line of sight that you can look out over the next 12, 18, 24 months in terms of the cash generative nature of this and you see how quickly our leverage comes down.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I'd say the only thing that's changed, Chris, is we're a year into this and we feel more confident about where we're at and where we're going.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No, that's fair. Look, the concept isn't that – we understand that the EBITDA is growing and that's naturally deleveraging. I was just thinking you're trying to absolutely reduce the debt level or not, is really where I was going.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think we'll have an absolute reduction in debt, but I think we'll also – like we've done in the past, because we generate so much cash, we're able to reinvest in our business for growth opportunities. We're able to bump our dividend from time to time, and we're able to buy back our stock, and we see all those things holding true as we move forward.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's helpful. Okay, so my follow-up question is around where you are seeing further growth opportunities. On a global basis, it feels like your bev business was up a couple points. You have taken out some capacity in a very targeted location. Where are you at with utilization across other facilities? Have you been able to free up capacity as part of what you're doing with integrating the Ball systems and the Rexam systems, or do you still feel that you see some white space out there to add capacity similar to what you've done in say Mexico or other places – namely I'm thinking about spots perhaps in Europe or more in Southeast Asia or other places? So could you give us a sense of where you're still seeing targeted opportunities?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Why don't I take that first? You really have to go around the globe. I'll let Dan talk about the opportunities in terms of geographies and where we see future demand growth that can help. But we continue – as you all know, over the last decade here in North America, for example, we've actually been able to take much of our 12-ounce capacity and capability that was underutilized and convert it to specialty. We're finding that the facilities we acquired, and we knew this, but it's a little bit more difficult to do it in the existing walls of the facilities we acquired. And so we are taking a fresh look, not only here in North America, but also in Europe as well. That's why when Dan talked about Recklinghausen, it was old capacity that was very difficult to convert. That was one of the reasons why we did that. But you should rest assured that we're going to continue to invest because there is growth even in some of these "more mature" markets, that we're going to have opportunities. Because whether it's sparkling waters, whether it's the teas here that continue to grow, energy drinks, even wine, as Dan alluded to, we continue to see good opportunities here in North America and in Europe and outside of that. Maybe, Dan, I'll turn it over to you and let you talk about geographic growth.
Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.: And so just to follow up on John's comments, when you hear us talk, you're hearing craft beer, you're hearing import beer, you're hearing wine, you're hearing seltzer water. You're talking about categories, so there's growth everywhere. And there will be investments in and around that from an innovations perspective everywhere. But if you're going to talk about geographic and just overall market growth, Southeast Asia continues to be a very exciting place, a lot of growth there. We've been there. We continue to look at what's the right investment. Obviously, our Myanmar facility is coming online. We've talked about and you've read recently the rebound in the economic situation in Spain. That looks to be a very attractive place for us. Eastern Europe continues to grow. There are other markets that are probably medium and long term that we're consistently evaluating, Africa, sub-continent Africa and other places. What's the right time to get in, and with what customers? Our customers typically lead us into these markets if we don't push them there from an innovation standpoint. And then we've acquired a really big business, a very good business in South America, and the can continues to win in that market. So there are different aspects of the growth profile. There's substrate penetration. There's overall market growth, then there's profit pool and segmentation growth. So any number of investment opportunities are in front of us. And we like the category. We like the beverage can in the foreseeable future, and it will present a lot of opportunity for us to continue to invest in and grow.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes, good morning, John and Scott.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And Dan.
C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC: My question has to do with how you guys might be thinking about the euro given its dramatic rise, especially in the last couple months or so. And I guess what you're suggesting is that maybe some of the headwinds you mentioned in a few of the segments might be offsetting any benefit you see there. And then maybe also, Scott, you could talk a little bit about how the currency change may or may not be shifting what you expect from a working capital contribution this year.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: The euro strengthening will help some. It's partially offsetting some of those negatives that we talked about, but it's not a huge impact. And if you look at it from an EPS standpoint, it's virtually no impact because of the debt that we have in Europe, the way we placed the debt. So we actually have less volatility in our earnings per share now than we used to have before the transaction.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And even – I'll go a step further. Even if you think about our Russian business, that's fundamentally a dollar-denominated business, and so it's helpful on the margin. But it's also – you mentioned the steep rise over the last couple months. Who's to say it's not going to reverse itself in the near term as well? So there is some benefit to it. We're not counting on perhaps where it is today, all that benefit showing up, and so there could be a little upside there, but the currency markets just have been very volatile recently.
C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then secondly, John, you mentioned that there has been a little bit of chop in the backlog at aerospace, which up to now has certainly seen a pretty good last 12 months when we've looked at the backlog. Do you feel or have you seen any change in tone with your obvious customers given some of the higher emphasis, at least from what I read in the papers, on defense spending?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, number one, there has been no chop. What I said in my prepared remarks, just so we're clear, is we had $1.4 billion in backlog and it's off about $150 million or so just because we've been burning that down as we've been working on that work. We haven't been awarded new contracts just because of government priorities. There's a number of senior staff level people that the positions haven't been filled yet, and so that has slowed down and pushed to the right the formal award winnings. But as I mentioned on previous calls, we have more opportunity in front of us than we've ever seen at Ball Corporation with our aerospace business. Nothing fundamentally has changed with the customer, meaning the U.S. government, other than the decision-making in the government bowels, so to speak, has been a little bit slower than it has been in the past.
C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my follow-on. First of all, if we think about the food can business, and recognizing it's obviously not the biggest piece of the Ball portfolio when you're running it for cash, it is still not earning your cost of capital. And, John, it has been a source of recurring – use the word you'd like. The one that comes to mind is disappointment over not just a couple years, but several years. Is there a time at which maybe the strategy there needs to be rethought, or do you really see, A) a clear avenue to getting returns above cost of capital and a great existing fit with your aerosol business? So some thoughts on that would be helpful. And then the second question I had, Scott, just in terms of corporate, I think you piggybacked or you were talking a little bit about this with Debbie's question. As you look at it, and on the one hand, costs are coming down, but some of those costs are coming out of the business units and being allocated back to corporate. If you were in our seat trying to model that out for the next couple years, are there any guard rails you could give us relative to the $140 million this year? Should corporate come down next year, or does it stay relatively flat because it's basically inheriting costs that used to be at the business level? Thank you, guys, and good luck on the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: George, let me hit the food business head on. First and foremost, you've got to play the cards that you're dealt. And this is a business that, as you said, let's put this in context. We could have great improvement in that and it doesn't really move the needle at Ball Corporation. Having said that, we own it, and we've got to the best we can with it unless there is something left to do – something else to do. We think the best course as we sit here right now is to continue to drive out the costs and continue to run up the cash. We do see a line of sight getting to the 9% after tax. But remember, that really has more to do with our compensation system, so we're well aligned on that. It's generating returns for our shareholders because it's generating returns in excess of our real cost to capital. We are always looking at our business about how to maximize it. Recall that we've been in a variety of businesses, and we've gotten into businesses and we've gotten out of businesses. We just passionate about it, and it needs to perform. We do think there's a line of sight to getting there, and that's the strategy we're currently pursuing.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And on the corporate undistributed, George, what we're trying to do is drive down total SG&A costs across the company. So you're right, over time some of those costs could move from a business into corporate undistributed, but what we're looking at is the total cost to serve and total SG&A cost. So I can't give you a real great line of sight to what that looks like over the next couple of years, but what we would hope is that we'd drive down the total SG&A cost.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, great. Thank you, Malika, and thank you, everyone, for participating and we look forward to talking to you as we go forward.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, May 4, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2017 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding descriptions of our segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2017 and beyond. We had a strong first quarter operationally with all of our reporting segments experiencing year-over-year improvement and we're well positioned as we move into the seasonally strong quarters. 2017 is right on track. Momentum is picking up in our businesses and the beverage can is winning versus other substrates around the globe. We are confident in our ability to capture planned cost savings and grow earnings cash flow and EVA dollars in all of our businesses. In addition to all of the great work being done, during the first quarter, our first quarter global beverage can volumes were up 51% driven by the Rexam transaction and related divestitures which closed at the end of June 2016. On a pro forma basis and after taking into account the impact of such transactions, global beverage can volumes were up approximately 2%, led by low to mid-single digit growth in North and Central America, South America and Europe that were offset by declines in EMEA and China. Scott will get into more details in his comments. We further improved operating efficiencies from our recently deployed growth CapEx projects in our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility. Our Canton, Ohio tin plate cutting and coating facility, our new Chestnut Hill, Tennessee aerosol line, and our devices UK and Velim, Czech Republic impact extruded aerosol expansions. We began preparations for the Reidsville, North Carolina beverage can plant closure, which is still expected to close in mid-summer. We completed the complex IT system integration work in the North American beverage operations and embarked up on additional transformational cost-out projects. We completed the closure of our food and aerosol metal service center in Weirton, West Virginia at the end of March. We sold our former Hubbard, Ohio, paint and general line container plant and an EVA positive transaction, and our aerospace business won additional contracts allowing our quarter-end contracted backlog to stand firm at $1.4 billion. Our multi-year value capture plants are on course and we will recognize the majority of the $150 million of expected 2017 synergies in the second half of the year. Before I turn it over to Scott, our board acknowledged the step-change we expect in terms of a higher level of free cash flow in 2017 and beyond by increasing the quarterly dividend by 54% to $0.80 per share annually on a pre-split basis and declared a 2-for-1 stock split effective this quarter. These announcements represent the confidence in our expectations, and it is the initial step in returning value to shareholders. Later in 2017, as we have line of sight towards a 3.5 times net debt to comparable EBITDA leverage, we will look towards returning additional value through share repurchases with over $20 million post-split shares currently available for repurchase under existing authorization. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. As John said, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 were $0.76 versus last year's $0.59, a 29% improvement. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of last year's beverage can acquisition, solid operational performance in all of our businesses, increased global demand for both beverage and aerosol containers and the lower tax rate. These benefits were partially offset by higher compensation and project costs, as well as higher interest expense and a higher share count. Details are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release and additional information will be provided in our 10-Q. Our Beverage Packaging North & Central America segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2017 were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico, plant efficiencies and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand in the U.S. and Canada as measured by the Can Manufacturers Institute dipped just slightly in the first quarter likely due to Easter slipping into the second quarter of this year and no leap year, while volumes in Mexico continued to grow in the beer sector. Overall volumes in our North and Central America segment were up 5% on a pro forma basis. Drivers for Ball's growth were craft beer, super premium beer and imported Mexican beer brands, coupled with robust demand for certain specialty cans in the CSD category. As a reminder, the acquired JVs in Guatemala, Panama and South Korea, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV are not consolidated and are reflected in equity earnings of affiliates along with our other equity investment in Vietnam. As you can see, these operations performed well in the quarter, largely due to strong can demand in these regions. Our Beverage Packaging South America segment saw improving volumes as we went through the quarter after a lower-than-expected January and February from a volume perspective, the industry saw strong March volumes and overall demand was up nearly 4% in the quarter and we were up roughly in line with the industry. For the full year, the South American team feels much more constructive about the market and economy. Our customers are using specialty cans to grow their business and deliver what the consumer is looking for. It may be too early to call, but the Brazilian government appears to be taking action to stimulate their economy, and while there are many challenges for the economy to overcome, it appears that the economic situation in Brazil is starting to improve. Results for the Beverage Packaging Europe segment reflect the typical seasonality and performed in line with our expectations. As we mentioned in January, our European beverage segment has work to do on its margins and certain initiatives to support multi-year plans have been initiated to improve revenue and cost management via repositioning into sleek, slim cans, as well as previously announced intention to close the Recklinghausen, Germany facilities. In the near-term, cost savings benefits in the region, including better operational performance will bolster second half performance. Industry supply demand is healthy, specialty demand remains favorable and construction of our new Spain plant is progressing as planned. Our other includes Ball's legacy Asia-Pacific business, the acquired EMEA business and corporate undistributed cost. Note 2 of the press release references approximately $45 million of corporate undistributed costs in the quarter, which is higher than the fourth quarter run rate, largely due to three equal items including the relocation of certain pension costs that formerly resided in the legacy Europe segment, higher stock based compensation in the quarter and incremental project costs that will benefit the corporation in the long-term. After netting off the corporate costs, you could see that the operations in Asia and the Middle East performed well. Moving to food and aerosol, comparable segment earnings were up year-over-year due to continued growth in global aerosol up 6% in the quarter, largely due to strong aluminum aerosol growth offset by U.S. food can demand declining 6% in the quarter. Starting in the second quarter, the segment will benefit from this cost savings associated with the West Virginia metal service center closure and anticipated growth for aluminum aerosol products. In summary, our global packaging businesses posted strong results and everyone is extremely focused on keeping this momentum going, meeting demand and effectively managing their invested capital base to drive EVA dollars from the combined business. Thank you again to all our operations teams around the globe. You will notice that our first quarter net debt came in around $7.5 billion. This is right on top of our plan and the debt will begin to come down as we move to the back half of the year. As we think about 2017, our previously communicated goals remain intact. We expect full year 2017 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles. After spending in the range of $500 million of CapEx, 2017 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 will be closer to a 179 million shares, given the dilutive effects of recently adopted accounting guidance for stock-based compensation plans and the absent – and absent the impact of timing of share repurchases. Full year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. The full year effective tax rate for 2017 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 26% due to a more favorable foreign rate differential. Corporate undistributed will now run about a $140 million for the full year 2017. The difference from our previous estimate of $115 million is divided pretty equally across three buckets. The first bucket is the inclusion of both the one-time true-up and stock-based compensation as well as accruing for higher incentive compensation this year. The second bucket has to do with some project costs related to more transformational projects now underway since the first stage of integration is behind us, and the third bucket is the inclusion of inactive retiree pension expenses moving to corporate from the legacy European beverage can business no longer owned by Ball. With that said, the operational performance is certainly enough to offset this full year increase. At current FX rates, we continue to expect year-end net debt to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. As you begin to think about the progression from the first quarter to the second quarter, there will be a nice step-up in profitability due to the normal seasonal ramp-up and moving in the third quarter, we need to phase in the closure of Reidsville as well as the phase-in of synergies. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved first quarter results driven by solid contract performance and the initial ramp-up related to our growing backlog. Congratulations again to the entire aerospace team for winning even more work since our last call, despite continued government contracting issues. Our aerospace business will see a nice step-up quarter-on-quarter as we roll in the new contracts. Now, across the company, and as we look forward, our team continues to be focused on achieving the financial benefits from the acquisition, optimizing our packaging, manufacturing network and beverage, food and aerosol, and managing the growth and investment in our aerospace business. Scott mentioned our 2017 goals, and nothing has changed since our January call that would warrant any changes to our targets. By 2019, we continue to aspire to generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA, and generate in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. For those of you who have known Ball over the years, we lever up to get a deal done, rapidly de-lever, spend any necessary growth capital on high returning projects, and then return our free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And that time-tested financial strategy is exactly what we plan to do. And with that, Kathy, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Certainly, thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. In North and Central America bev, you talked about overall volumes up 5%. I was wondering if it's possible to parse that out between U.S. and Mexico, and maybe other markets. And you talked about some of the reasons why the CMI data might have been a little bit weaker this quarter for the U.S. I was just wondering if you could talk about the U.S. market in terms of the tightness of the market and maybe how your CSD and beer customers seem to be doing early in the year?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, Anthony, this is John. I'll try and tackle that. It's – we run it as a system. So sometimes, it's difficult to parse it out. But I'll give you a couple of observations. Recall that this time last year, we're really just getting our Monterrey, Mexico facility up and running. So we are actually shipping cans from the United States into Mexico to backfill that ramp-up. With Monterrey up and running right now, that's not happening. And so, when you look at CMI data, that excludes Mexico, it doesn't include shifts like that, that you would see. The second thing I would say here in North America you – excuse me, here in the United States, what you're seeing is, as we talked about, we're having very strong – continued strong growth in the craft segment, we're up 26% or so in the first quarter. A lot of the mainstream brands by the domestic producers continue to be off a couple of percent. It's a soft drink despite 12-ounce continue to be declining overall as a segment and for us, it was up driven by the specialty containers, which is good. And so, Mexico has been growing relatively strong for us just because we're on the back of many of our customers down there that are doing quite well. So hopefully, that gives a little flavor of it all.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's very helpful. And then just one more, at the Analyst Day, I think you talked about footprint opportunities as being separate from the core $300 million plus synergy number. And the closures of Reidsville and Recklinghausen, I guess, on our math could be over $50 million in cost savings. I'm wondering as you think about going forward in – should we think about kind of a $350 million plus number as opposed to a $300 million plus number or there are offsets or is that the right way to think about it?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, recall from the very beginning, we said, we're not going to get into this parsing out, because we're not going to have a bunch of accountants running around, trying to track down everything. I think the best way to say it is we standby what we talked about in terms of our targets around 2017 and 2019, and we did talk about that we're going to be chasing, we're economically incentivized for all of us to be chasing as many of the cost and revenue synergies that we can get at and you should expect that's exactly what we're going to do.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. I'll turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good. Thanks. How are you?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good, Matt.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good, good. So, given the comment in the release that the 1Q results exceeded your expectations, can you provide some additional color on what this refers to specifically? Was it regional volumes, integration efforts or was it something entirely different?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I would say yes. Yes to all that. As we were – as we kind of came into the year, obviously, it's a seasonally slow quarter and from a volume perspective, we were having – we finished the year in Brazil a little bit softer. It really started to come back in the second half of the quarter, which is quite strong. I mentioned some of the trends in North and Central America. A very strong beer volume particularly down in Mexico, even CSD volumes on the specialty side offsetting many of the declines (17:12) and even in Europe, while there was nothing overly exciting in Europe, it was kind of as an industry and as Ball, we were growing a couple percent, which is right in line. And so, I think that was part of it. And then our integration efforts continue to go well. We've got – still have a lot of work in front of us. Maybe I'll turn it over to Scott in a minute from a G&A and the integration and talking about some of the investments we're making that will help us pull out some of the G&A as we go forward, but I think overall from a cost perspective, from a best practice sharing perspective, from a sourcing perspective, from G&A, I think we're making progress, though.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. And even the aerospace backlog, I mean it continues to be incredibly strong, and we chase more work. I think on the some of the projects that we're going after as it relates to corporate costs, I think we're finding a lot of opportunities to streamline, centralize, standardize things. And those types of things will take a little bit more time to have a benefit, but we're feeling really good about those opportunities. And on the working capital front, our sourcing teams, treasury, the operations, I think we're finding a lot of opportunities, to get after it, it's just a question of when those things will show up, will we get benefit in 2017, or how much benefit will we get in 2017, and how much will we get beyond.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. And just to amplify a little bit on what Scott said on the G&A side and centralizing some of this, when you go to centralize and take things out of the various facilities would have been done much more locally and/or regionally, sometimes you have redundant costs, because you first have to set up a centralized capability before you can look at taking some of the cost out at the plant level, and that's the process we're in right now.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, piggybacking on that question, given the first quarter outperformance, do you feel better about how you're tracking within your 20% to 30% earnings growth target for 2017? And would you maybe comment on if you feel yourself drifting towards the higher end of that range at this point?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No. Yes, I think, to be honest, it's too early to tell. We are right where we expected, and as I said in my prepared remarks, relative to what we told the world in January, nothing has changed at all. I do think that as you all know that we make a fair amount of our money in the second and the third quarter and so the next couple of quarters will largely determine where we'll be in the range, but I think it's premature to speculate about what part of that range we're going to be in.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. That's it from me. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Scott, I was hoping you could just help out for a minute just on the European margin. You said you took some of the pension expense. It sounded like stranded pension expense from assets you sold and moved it into the corporate line. Was that in the fourth quarter number and maybe just trying to figure out what that was so we could see the sequential improvement in Europe versus just moving the pension out?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. And you are comparing – it's not helpful to compare Europe year-over-year because we have two different businesses.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, I just meant sequentially 4Q to 1Q, was trying to figure that out.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Got it. There was just a – there's a difference in interest rate assumptions that will impact 2017 going forward. Our pension cost in total, if you think about the company in total, it's not at all different than what we thought, it's just in different buckets.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And if I look at the – in South America, two questions on South America. One, is 2Q the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, and how should we think about the progression there into the second half mostly from a volume and earnings perspective? And then just the other part would be on substrate substitution, are you seeing anything that would lead you to believe that cans or glasses, one or the other is gaining or losing market share there? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, Scott, I'll take this. With respect to your first question, yes, the second quarter and even the third quarter are the two seasonally slow quarters and it depends year-to-year, which one is a little bit slower, so it's too premature to tell. But as Scott had mentioned in his remarks, are we at the bottom in terms of overall economic growth in Brazil? Perhaps too early to tell, but the tone and tenor feels a bit better now than it did three months ago. In terms of your question about package mix, I can tell you the can continues to take share in there. Again just to give you some facts here; the beer consumption in the first quarter in Brazil, like happened in last year, it decreased 2.1%, but despite that the aluminum can was up almost 4% in there. So by definition, we are taking share. You know, soft drink, it declined 9%, the can was off about that much as well, so I don't think there's a lot of movements, but we do continue to see the can taking share relative to other substrates in Brazil, particularly on the beer side.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, good morning. Thank you. Just with Europe, I think you know that in the past you've talked about your efforts there to sort of improve the margin via sort of like mix and cost and that I think you expected some progress in 2017 and more in 2018. Could you just, I guess, give any more details on how you're doing with that, and if your expectations have changed at all?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, I think what you just described is exactly what we're doing; we're focusing on mix, and we're focusing on the cost side. And on the mix side that we've got a great network of specialty that we believe is under-levered. And so as we go to really push and take the strategy that we've done in North America, and move it over to Europe, to really creating greater profit pools for our customers by using our specialty network, that's one area of value that we're focused on. The other one is on the cost side, and whether it's on everything from operating cost to SG&A cost to plant efficiencies to sourcing, we're focusing on all those things. And we said it's going to take – it'd be a multiyear program, we're right in the midst of it, we see nothing that changes what our aspirations and goals are around that.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just for South America, I think on last Chorus Call, you kind of talked about how maybe in Brazil, the hope was for (23:57) to be flat, maybe up a little bit, I guess, I know Q3, so this quarter is a smaller quarter, but I mean, do you have any sense as whether you kind of beat those expectations and whether lines could be up a little bit better than sort of flat to up 1%.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. I honestly think, it's all of us are looking into a crystal ball. Economically, it's volatile there, I know the middle class continues to struggle, employment's around – unemployment, excuse me, is around 13% and it really hasn't moved all that much. I know retail sales are flat to down a little bit. That really needs to change in the second half of the year. And I'm no economist, but speaking to people there, most people think that the worst is behind us. The question is, will there be a rebound or will it just be stagnant, and that's a $24,000 question.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Just sticking with Brazil for a minute, I think you said in the release, the volumes were up mid-single digits, wasn't sure if that was for the quarter or that was the run rate as you exited the quarter and sounded like the trends definitely accelerated through the quarter. So, I was hoping you could maybe provide your view on kind of how you exited the quarter? I know, there was some shift with Carnival and Easter, but just trying to think of it on an apples-to-apples basis.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. The number I gave was a full quarter number, it was actually down in January, February and then it bounced back in March. So, it actually – coming out the of quarter was at a much higher run rate than that.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. The volumes continue to be reasonably strong, but don't read into too much, anytime you have – given the supply chain months and months, particularly in environments like Brazil can shift relatively quickly there. So I know you're trying to look at the acceleration of momentum. I would temper you a little bit there because we are entering into a seasonally slow period of time.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That helps. Thanks. And, Scott, just on the corporate change, it sounds like we're thinking it's a little – maybe $25 million higher than before, but the full year guide, sounds like nothing has really changed. Just wondering what the offsets are? Is it maybe Latin America being a little bit better or progress on Europe margins?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: The tax rate – yes, maybe, if you think about it, I gave a little bit lower tax rate by a couple of 100 basis points versus the original tax base or the tax rate would offset it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: But also...
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: (26:35) too.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. And with the volume trends that we see not only now, but obviously we need to have the right weather this summer. But in all the various regions that we laid out before, we continue to see good volume trends in that and that will be a big determinant. But as we sit here right now from both an operating earnings perspective, and Scott said it from an EPS perspective, we don't think the added undistributed cost really impact anything we said.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But you think you can end the year kind of at the same run rate you are at or some of these costs seem like they're maybe frontloaded in the year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. I think they were higher in the first quarter. They'll come down as we move through the back half of the year.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: It's not going to run at the same pace as the first quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. And remember, the first quarter relative, Scott mentioned that there was kind of three buckets. Two of the three arguably were one-time items and – certainly the higher stock-based incentive was a one-time kind of catch-up. And then as I said we're kind of pre-investing at a centralized G&A level to take things out of the regions. And then, the third thing in terms of legacy pension, that will continue to grow.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): John, I wondered just, you are working your way through Rexam, you've had a lot of new projects come online over the last year. If we look out two or three years, what are the opportunities for kind of further expansion look like to you?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, as...
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just, in terms of perhaps new plants or whatever?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, I think we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day back in December. Nothing has really changed. I think there is great opportunity in all three of our product lines, the beverage can, the food and aerosol and the aerospace. On the beverage can side, a lot of the trends over the first couple of years we said, we're really going to be focusing on going after the value capture that we identify, but there is still growth. We talked about Spain as a good example and this continued move in the specialty, where we've got a footprint that we think we can leverage to the benefit of our customers and that is exactly what we're going to be doing. Beyond that, that we talked earlier on the call about the can is winning relative to other substrates. We see that as a secular movement and we're going to try to do as best we can to take full advantage of that in every region in we operate and continue to look at other emerging regions that we think the can could perform well there. On the aerosol side, as we mentioned, aerosol volumes in the quarter I think, were a good representation. We were up very strongly in that. The only place we were a bit down was down in Argentina and that largely had to do with the Zika virus a year ago, when we weren't selling as many disinfectant cans. And then on the aerospace side, we continue to do some great things and win some great work and as we talk about, as the program started up, some of the margins started to go down a little bit only because the way the accounting works. But we are very well-positioned to have a multiyear run in that business. So all those things, you never know, what happens in the global environment and global economy. But as we look out three years, four years, five years, we continue to see all those trends developing in a way that we're going to try and take full advantage of.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And I know it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but can you talk about what you saw in the first quarter both in China and in EMEA?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, those are both volatile types of places. We've had our own challenges in China as you know over the past couple of years. The volumes were down in that segment, low double digits kind of 10% or 11%. But that was again seasonally slow and had to do a little bit with Chinese New Year and some other things like that. We see no fundamental changes going on in that. I know, the overall market was a little flat, but we chose not to make cans, that we would be losing money on. And then on EMEA, it's so many different regions everywhere from Turkey to Egypt to Saudi and other places, that was down as well, but again that was, I think, that was more a one-time related, in terms of some of the political issues we've seen. So I don't read into that too much. And we still think that area shows some promise.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And despite softer volumes, the financial performance was right in line with what we expected there. Both those regions are going to do a good job of cost out. So the financial performance will be fine.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then finally just on aerospace, your backlog was steady quarter-to-quarter. Wondered if you could talk about just sort of what the pipeline of bids and potential wins looks like right now?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, that's great that our government was able to get through a budget resolution at least for the next five months, which is good. And because stability in terms of predictability around those things help, through any transition we've gone the – the government's gone through a pause because there is a lot of turnover on the people side of it and we're a little bit behind the curve and having new people and seats, but as we look out, like we said over the last couple of quarters, we see the most amount of opportunities I've ever seen in my time here at Ball Corporation, for aerospace and we're going to continue to bid on those types of things, but it's all predicated on us executing very well and we have been doing that and great execution creates great opportunities and that's where we sit right now.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Very good. Good luck in the rest of the year.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. This is actually Victoria Madsen sitting in for George. Hi, John, Scott, how are you?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good. How are you?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, thanks.
Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Doing well. Thank you. So, first of all, can you just discuss volume trends in key businesses so far in the second quarter?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, I think, we've discussed almost all of them and so I'd just ask you maybe when the transcript comes out, you can review it again and see if you have any questions you can give us a buzz, because we did largely cover them, but overall, I think, we're relatively pleased with the volume trends we've seen to start off the beginning of the year.
Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. And well, it maybe a little bit too early, can you comment thus far on your efforts to pursue commercial benefits, particularly as contracts come up for renewal?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, I think, the acquisition – nothing has changed relative to the acquisition of what we've always tried to do and we'll try and do. We've discussed in the past that we always try and give value for our products and services and everything that we do and that could include price, it could include tighter order call-offs, it could include helping our customers becoming more efficient using cans on their lines, it could include mix that I talked about earlier on the call. As we all know, 12 oz is a very competitive package and where we compete with others. We're trying to be the leaders, but you got to be realistic in terms of our customers' alternatives. But what we try to do over the past number of years, particularly here in North America and we're spreading it out, South America is doing well and Europe we still have more work to do, is trying to help our customers expand the profit pools of the products, so that we can all win. Whether better graphics in the craft beer segment, different can sizes in CSD, for example that are going well, so far this year, new can formats, penetration like sparkling water, energy drink markets, or even bottles for both beer and non-alcoholic areas. So, if we can help our customers grow their profit pools, it's going to be helpful to us as well.
Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, okay. Great. Thank you. And, just one last quick one and apologies if I missed it, but can you go over, how much of your synergy target was achieved in the first quarter? Given that assuming, it'll be a relatively comparatively low amount, given that work, early in the year and integration. But if you could, have any commentary around that?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. What we said, we said earlier in the call, but what we also said nine months ago that we're not going to get into parsing out of synergies, because you have to get more accounts to track that down, what we standby is, what our targets are in terms of 2017, 2019 and beyond, related to our comparable EBITDA, as well as our free cash flow. And, we did say that in 2017, the majority of the synergies would be coming in the back-half of the year, and we standby what we said.
Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Can you give us – I guess a question for Scott, can you give us a refresher on how to think about the cadence in the synergy capture this year, and the big bucket as you layered in there? I know it's a little bit more back-half loaded versus front-half. Is it like a 30:70 split, 40:60, any color would be helpful.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We'll get more on the back-half than they will in the front-half. We're going to get – the 150 run rate is still going to – is still good. We haven't seen much of that other than the closure of Millbank in the first part of the year and then a lot of the other things that we've been working on start to run through our P&L in the second quarter, but you're not going to see the benefit of those things until we get to the third quarter and fourth quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And just amplifying, Scott, remember that we announced the closure of the Charlotte facility and it kind of happens mid-year, so that's really the third quarter and fourth quarter.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Reedsville.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. We talked a lot about the – in prior calls about the sourcing side of it where we really didn't get any benefit in the first quarter. We're going to get some, but not a full run rate benefit in the second quarter, and as we move to the third quarter and fourth quarter, that's when it'll really start to show up. I think a lot of the operational improvements in terms of best practice sharing at the plants, those take time to mobilize and rally the people and it really gets down to the manufacturing side, and as you know, our high season in the second quarter and third quarter, so as we go through the year, we're going to get more and more of that. So, qualitatively, those are the types of things why we continue to say it's going to be in the second half. But we don't want to get pinned down as a 30:70 or 40:60 because the reality is we're driving real hard to show up with a comparable EBITDA and free cash flow we set for 2017 and 2019 and beyond.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And it's becoming less, I mean a smaller segment for you, but North America food seems like volumes for you, lagged the market a little bit. Was there any share shift in there, thoughts on just the vegetable pack? And I guess lastly in that segment, you talked about how there are some cost savings that's going to start rolling to a little more fully in 2Q. Can you help us – can you remind us what the opportunity could be in terms of the magnitude of the savings?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. First with – we said we were down more than the overall market, but there was no share loss. All of our customers, every customer is a bit different, but it's a very seasonally slow quarter, in some of our quarter our customers just weren't pulling as much as we had expected. So, I wouldn't read into that too much. As for the pack, as we go to summer, it's too early to tell. It's beginning of May and plantings are just starting to go in many of our customers and so, we'll be able to update you as we go through the summer on that. And then your last question about cost savings, remember we had a very big cost saving, a big project about the closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility and investment on the cutting and coating side in the Canton, Ohio. Weirton, West Virginia didn't officially close until the end of March, but we've gotten no benefits of that. So, as we go forward, that's where we see a lot of the improvement to come from.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Just one last one from me on aerospace, backlog is obviously, they have been pretty strong. How should we think about the ramp up phase in terms of these new wins from a revenue and a margin standpoint in next few quarter? And then big picture, what's been the big catalyst for some of these recent wins, I mean obviously you guys are taking share? Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. In terms of the ramp up, it's really no different than historically what we've seen. And remember, we really do three businesses in that, we've got a – I'll call it as the traditional satellite business, we've got a components business which is the tactical products, things that go in the Joint Strike Fighter for example and then we have a services businesses. The first two, the satellites and the tactical products is really where we've been winning the preponderance of the work and majority of those types of things, it spread out, but majority of them are cost plus in nature. And so, as you get started on these new programs, the margins that show up are a little bit less because as you de-risk the programs, that's when the margins start to increase. And so, I think our margins in the first quarter were slightly down relative to last year. It was wholly expected because of these new startups and as we go through over the next couple of years, you should see an improvement in those margins as we de-risk these programs that are just starting now. In terms of the opportunity set, we've talked about this in the past, some of our capabilities are exactly what the U.S. government needs right now. A lot of it's in the classified world, so we can't talk about it, but when you think about the needs for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and you also see in terms of the budgets being relatively restricted, they need more for less and the exquisite maybe important, but sometimes we can do something at a cost basis that's a little bit less than what other people can do. And I think the government in this environment is looking for new ways of doing business with them, and that's where it falls into our sweet spot.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: John or Scott, is there a way to help us with how much Rexam contributed to EBIT in the quarter?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We're running it out of the system, so I mean, the obvious would be to look at Brazil where we acquired a much bigger business than what we had before, so the vast majority of that would be what we acquired in Europe, we exchanged a large degree – a new business and sold our old business, so it's an apple and a pear there. And then North America, we're running it from an integrated standpoint, we're now looking at it as these are Rexam earnings and these are Ball earnings, they're all Ball earnings. So, we don't really look at it that way.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Okay. Why the decision to split your stock?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: It was really – we've done this historically a number of times, when we get to this range and splitting the stock without a nice juice of the dividend doesn't really do much. So it was really about confidence in our cash flow going forward and liquidity in the shares. We will continue to be – once we de-lever to the point we've talked about, we will be an aggressive acquirer of our shares. So creating more liquidity in the stock helps, so splitting the stock and bumping the dividend is a sign that we feel pretty good about where we're at and where we're going.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. And on working cap, I know you said last call you expected it to be a source of $100 million this year, is that still the case? And where...
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think it will be better than that. I think our teams, treasury, sourcing, the operations are all working great together. And we're an EVA company, we acquired pretty big businesses that didn't focus on EVA, and didn't focus on their capital base. And when you get people focused on working capital and what we can do and people get paid off of EVA, I think we're finding no shortage of opportunities, it's really a question of the execution – the timing of the execution of those opportunities and how much will show up in 2017 and then how much will show up beyond 2017.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And just, of that $100 million-plus, how much roughly is coming from which bucket if you can go into that level of detail?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: There is all kinds of buckets, I mean, every component of working capital we're looking at, so.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: You know, receivables, payables, inventory, I mean every – I'm not going to get by region, by segment.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We run it in total.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. But let me give you an example, I think as someone asked earlier about the amount of Rexam earnings. In North America here, we're running it as a – North and Central America, we're running it as a system. And so, we've moved volumes around into the various plants to optimize that from a freight and logistics perspective. And as we do that, we realize that there is inventory opportunities both on the raw materials side as well as the finished goods side. And so, that's just one area, in addition to focusing on the receivables and focusing on the payables.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And just one last one on working cap. If you get the $100 million-ish this year, is there more where that came – would you expect a comparable level of benefits next year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think the benefit over the next few years will be well in excess of the $100 million.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I have just two questions on South America and one on Russia. Just kind of broadly speaking, if we look at South America, I think the long-term expectations for growth is probably one of the reasons you've seen another player move into that market. Can you talk about your customer mix and whether that allows you to kind of grow in line with the market, and does that matter? And then two, kind of the impact of any potential new capacity that would be coming on in the region?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, first, we've got a relatively – not relative, we have a large position down in South America, and we do business with every major customer down there. And so, I think it's safe to say as the mark goes, so do we. So I wouldn't really focus on over-weighted one customer relative to the other because we're big with many of the customers down there. With respect to the new competitor coming in, as I said, the overall, the market was down a little bit last year. It's actually come back strongly particularly as we move through the first quarter and it's obviously going into a seasonally slow, but we see some tightness in there and I don't want to comment on what the customer activities, we're focusing on what we can do. The other thing we really haven't talked about is we always focused just on Brazil. We also acquired a business in other regions as well including Argentina and Chile and have the ability to serve multiple of markets in that and the can continues to gain share in those markets as well and so that's one of the areas we're also focused on.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then Russia, I just – I don't think you talked about trends there, forgive me, if you have, but can you just kind of give us an update on how things are going in Russia where you see that the market is heading this year in utilization if possible?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. We'll – again Russia is – the first quarter is seasonally slow, Russia is going okay right now. There is nothing magical about it, it's a slow quarter, but then it was up a little bit in the first quarter. We expect for the full-year it to be up modestly as a lot of the trends we've talked about earlier and our capacity I think it's in reasonably good shape right now. And so as we look to it – it is different than the business in Europe that we used to have, because it is more weighted to the second quarter and third quarters and it was the first quarter and the fourth quarters, and we're just about to enter into the that seasonally strong period, but nothing – no big deviations from expectations. That's the way to say it.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thank you for all the updates.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed with your question.
Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: John as you look at the volumes in the first quarter, which seem to be pretty strong. Do you expect to see that kind of progress and I know it's tricky with the pro forma computations, but do you think we will see certainly as we get into the second half and your footprint is similar year-to-year, does some mid-single digits number in most of these regions look sustainable?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, mid-single digit sounds a touch higher to me, but let's take a step back and think about all the trends that we've talked about, because there is – it's really in line with some of the long-term trends we talked about. We talked about in North America is relatively flat, you've got 12 lines declining, but you have specialty increasing. We talked about Mexico doing quite well in part, because of the domestic consumption and in part because of the exports in the United States that continues to grow. We talked about long-term South America being in kind of the 3% to 5% range just kind of right where the first quarter was, we talked about Europe, kind of in the 2% to 4% range, 1% to 3% depending on what location in Europe, that's exactly where it's coming in. I think what was little bit soft was EMEA and China, but again, those are volatile markets, so you never really look quarter-to-quarter and structurally what we see is nothing fundamentally different there. So, I don't think anything was way out of line and as we go forward and laugh, if you will, the closing date of the acquisition, I think some of those trends longer-term are remain intact now. Will any given quarter be a deviation from one of those things for some reason or another, I'm sure, it will, but I think as a system around the world, we continue to believe that the can is going to take share from other substrates.
Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. And by the way, when you were going at the beginning of the call, I think you mentioned some volume numbers and I might have just missed them, but that seem to be different from the press release, for example, I think the press release said, Europe was up low single digits, and I think you mentioned it may have been down, maybe you were talking about a different comparison? And also, I think you refer to low to single – sorry, low-to-mid digit increases in North and South America and Central America when at the press release, sort of implied or said mid single digits. I don't mean to split hairs, but could you just put some light on that?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. For the avoidance of doubt, our European business was up 2.5%; 2.8% or so. Our South American business was around 3% increase and our North and Central America was up about 5%. And I think Scott mentioned that, so...
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: EMEA and Asia.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And then EMEA and Asia were down as I mentioned Asia – excuse me, China was down about 10%, 11% and EMEA was down as well.
Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got you. Okay. And the last thing is, it's interesting that you all are or actually quite – I think terrific that you gave us this forecast or guidance back in I think late July, early August last year for 2017 and you're holding to it, for example, the $750 million to $850 million in EBITDA. And if you think about it, you all are, and I don't mean to do a math lesson here, but it looks like you said at the low end of your guidance that you would have like $651 million in net earnings attributable to Ball, but that when we do your adjusted earnings like you did this quarter, we should add back the after tax impact of the amortization of customer payables. So, given that that's somewhere in the zone of $128 million a year and you – tax effect this at the new tax rate of 26%. Basically, what I'm seeing is something like $746 million at the low end and that seems to be exactly where the consensus is $4.17 and I just didn't know if you had a comment that you believe that's because the Street and aggregate definitely thinks you're only going to maybe get to the low end or do you think there might be some people treating your amortization of intangibles differently and that might be affecting the computation?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, I'm still trying to go through your math, but I got to be honest. I don't think my computer could work that fast. But in all seriousness, what we standby everything we said, which is 20 – what we said, it was $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, it's too early to say, where we're going to end up in that. We've got our most strongest quarter is coming in front us over the next two quarters. So it's premature to really talk about that. But we laid out what we thought for interest expense, what we laid out for the tax rate, what we laid out for the share count. And when you do all – and then we also talked about 20% to 30%, when you kind of do all that math, I don't disagree with exactly what you said.
Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I mean, it's pretty simple, it's $651 million plus the $95 million, which is tax effective $130 million – $128 million and you divided that by $179 million, which by the way means no buybacks and you get to $4.17 just for those listening. But I appreciate the clarification.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: All right. Thanks, Chip.
Operator: And Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, Kathy. Well, thank you all for your interest. And we look forward to talking with you as we go forward and looking for the next quarterly conference call as we enter this important summer season. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect from the call. Thank you. Have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, February 2, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, Maleka, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company's news releases. If you don't already have our fourth quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding descriptions are a new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2017 and beyond. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. The momentum that we expected to accelerate in late 2016 and into 2017 is on track and our financial goals for 2017 and beyond remain intact. As we reiterated at our December Investor Day, we will continue to strive for perfection in all aspects of our work to ensure that the metal containers we produce are the most sustainable packages in their respective supply chains from a cost, quality, innovation and recycling point of view and that our aerospace products and systems we deliver go beyond our customers' expectations to support our nation's defense, cyber and scientific discovery needs. Now on behalf of Scott, myself and the rest of the senior management team, we want to extend our thanks to the thousands of employees who have devoted long hours to executing the complex beverage acquisition integration and separation work, improving our food and aerosol business, growing our aerospace backlog and simply holding down the fort. Our team has navigated 2016 with a work ethic and ownership culture that I would stack up against anyone at any time. This team's humble can do spirit will insure our ability to capture the cost savings and pursue new growth opportunities to further grow earnings, cash flow and EVA dollars in our beverage, food and aerosol and aerospace businesses. In addition to all the integration work that we've been doing within the acquired business, in the fourth quarter, we officially closed the former Rexam Millbank headquarters and we have no employees remaining at this facility. We completed an expansion of our Velim, Czech Republic extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility, we completed the complex IT and support systems integration and separation work in Europe, we began the start-up of our Canton, Ohio food and aerosol cutting and coating operation, we completed the start-up of the second line of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility and our aerospace business won additional contracts and concluded 2016 with $1.4 billion of contracted backlog. Truly a solid quarter and a transformative year. As we move into 2017, we are focused on executing our ongoing integration and transformation plans, promoting the beverage can as the package of choice, optimizing our costs in all aspects of our business and meeting the expectations of all of our stakeholders. Several qualitative updates on our synergy capture efforts. From a G&A perspective, we are on track with the elimination of shorter term redundancies already announced and/or occurred. Over the next several years, we will now work to standardize and optimize our G&A processes to ensure we are world-class in all of our business support functions. Our sourcing negotiations are largely concluded and we will expect to see meaningfully improved quarter-over-quarter comparisons as we move through the 2017 into 2018. Given the way our inventory build works, we expect to see these synergies flow through our P&L beginning late first quarter. Work continues on our footprint optimization efforts, and we continue to look at areas where we can actively manage and right size our fixed cost base to serve our customers and our best practice sharing efforts have identified a number of areas from line efficiency gains to leveraging our plant floor systems, to metal spec reductions and other similar items that we have begun executing upon. We are six months into our newly combined business and while much work is ahead of us, I like where we're at. Our road map of a multi-year value capture runway remains intact, and we expect to see sequential quarter-on-quarter improvements as we move through the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2016 were $0.87 versus last year's $0.80, and full year 2016 comparable results were $3.49 versus last year's $3.48. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement largely due to the beverage can acquisition and solid operational performance in nearly all of our businesses that was partially offset by softer demand in Brazil, higher interest expense, a higher tax rate, and a notably higher share count. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was lower than we expected back in the third quarter, largely due to favorable 2016 fourth quarter one-time items. Also with regard to taxes, a significant portion of the cash taxes related to the transaction-related divestments have been settled as of the year-end 2016. Our GAAP results for 2016 were impacted by transaction-related costs, hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments associated with the sale of the divested business. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-K, expected to be filed by March 1, 2017. Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment comparable operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016 were up year over year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico, plant efficiencies, and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 0.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.2% for the full year 2016. Relative to CMI industry data, meaning excluding Mexico, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter and year. Every month our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make production improvements, and our key customer continues to execute its business development plans in the region with continuing solid U.S. demand for their products. As a reminder, the acquired JVs in Guatemala, Panama, and South Korea as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV are now consolidated and are reflected in the equity earnings of affiliates along with our other equity investment in Vietnam. As you can see, these operations performed well in the quarter, largely due to strong demand in these regions. Our beverage packaging South America segment faced volume pressure in the fourth quarter, as poor weather early in the quarter affected beverage demand and beer demand softened in Brazil due to further contraction in GDP. Brazilian industry can demand in the quarter was down 7.5%. Full-year 2016 industry volumes were down 4%, and our full-year pro forma volume was off roughly low double digits. Both Brazil and Argentina continued to be impacted by the tough inflationary environment. The team in South America is actively assessing supply/demand conditions and cost structure in the region. Even with recent demand trends, the South America team sees a path to improved results in 2017. Results for the beverage packaging Europe segment were impacted in the quarter by more pronounced seasonality versus our legacy European operations and selected curtailments in the fourth quarter to manage inventories. While the business largely performed in line with our expectations, our European beverage segment has work to do on the overall profitability, and multiyear plans have been initiated to tackle the situation from a revenue and cost management perspective, and our team is well motivated and incentivized to succeed. Industry supply/demand remains tight in nearly all European countries where we operate, and specialty demand remains favorable, with a bias towards the continued shift into sleek and small-size specialty. As we discussed last quarter, Ball is constructing a new plant near Madrid, Spain. Earth is being moved and equipment is on order. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract, and the Iberian Peninsula continues to see high single-digit growth in 2016. As we disclosed in the third quarter, our other segment includes Ball's legacy Asia-Pacific business, the acquired EMEA business, including the 51% owned and consolidated Saudi JV, and corporate undistributed costs. Note 2 references approximately $32 million of corporate undistributed costs in the quarter and $110 million for the full year 2016. The markets for the operations represented in the other segment are dynamic, like in Egypt. Details of the impact of the fourth quarter devaluation of the Egyptian pound are covered in the notes to today's earnings release. Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings were up year over year due to continued growth in global aerosol, offset by lower food can demand. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track, and starting in the second quarter will benefit 2017 performance which coincides with the scheduled closure of the West Virginia facility and the continued ramp-up of the new equipment in Canton, Ohio. In addition, the additional capacity in our newly-expanded Velim, Czech Republic plant will further serve growth for aluminum aerosol personal care products. In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were consistent with our expectations, and everyone is extremely focused on achieving our financial goals and driving EVA dollars from the acquisition as well as recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all our team members, with an extra shout-out to our global financial reporting and IT teams. Teamwork, professionalism, and a fair amount of brute force got us to where we are today, really amazing work. You will notice that our fourth quarter net debt came in just under our $7 billion year-end target. As we think about 2017, we stand by our prior goals for key financial metrics. We expect full-year 2017 comparable operating earnings to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles. After spending in the range of $500 million of CapEx, 2017 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. The full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 will be roughly 178 million shares absent the impact and timing of any share repurchases. Full-year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. The full-year effective tax rate for 2017 on comparable earnings is expected to be around 28%. Corporate undistributed is now estimated to be in the range of $115 million for full-year 2017 due to some higher IT and certain costs formerly allocated to the segments like European pensions. At current FX rates, we continue to expect year-end net debt to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. As you begin to think about the progression of improvement year over year on a quarterly comparable diluted earnings per share basis, you need to phase in some of the actions we have discussed like the closure of Charlotte midyear and other announced facilities in food and aerosol and North American beverage, as well as the phase-in of synergies as we move into the year. We expect to build momentum in 2017 with each successive quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved fourth quarter results, driven by solid contract performance and the initial ramp-up related to our growing backlog. Congratulations again to the entire aerospace team. Our contracted backlog closed the year at $1.4 billion and we've won even more work in the month of January. Given the growth in this segment, we will be expanding our Westminster, Colorado aerospace manufacturing center and investing in additional test equipment. As we mentioned in the release and at our December Investor Day, our aerospace business will see a nice step up in sales and operating earnings in 2017, the pace of which will increase quarter on quarter as we roll in the new contracts and move through the year. Now across the company, and as look forward, we continue to gain even more visibility into our customer's plans for promoting our containers in 2017 and beyond. The opportunities before us in packaging and aerospace are numerous and we have the team in place to execute. While we are proud of what we have accomplished so far, there is much work to be done, and our team is focused on achieving the financial benefits from the transaction, adding flexibility to our manufacturing network to proactively serve our customers, managing our cost base with a sense of urgency and managing the growth and investment in our aerospace business. As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goal and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. Scott mentioned our 2017 goals and by 2019 we continue to drive towards generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. And when we have a greater line of sight to our leverage getting to 3.5 times, we will accelerate the return of value to our fellow shareholders. And with that, Maleka, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And our first question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Hi.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Hi.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about the margins within the European beverage packaging segment? I mean, they came in about 300 basis points lower than our estimate. Sounds like maybe there's some seasonality in that business that we didn't anticipate. But how did it compare relative to your expectations? And can you talk about sequentially how we should think about that as we move into the first quarter 2017?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. Sure, Scott. This is Scott. Yeah. I think it's important to know that what we bought is exactly as we expected. If you're comparing year over year, it's a bit of an apple and an orange. Remember the business that we bought is much more seasonal than what we had. And the fourth quarter is traditionally pretty slow. We got a bigger concentration of business in Russia and the Nordics which really slows down in the fourth quarter. And then if you're comparing back to before, it's a bit of apples and oranges. In 2015, we were building inventory because of things that were going to happen in early 2016 which helped margins. In fourth quarter of this year, we were managing inventory levels and took some down time which hurts margins. So it's really not a fair comparison. As we said before, we have a big opportunity over the next few years to get the margins to a more acceptable level and we have plans in place and we're looking at everything from revenue to mix to all of our costs to improve the business. But you've got to be a little patient here. It takes a little bit of time. It doesn't happen overnight. And I think we'll see nice progress in 2017 and even more in 2018 and beyond. But I think it's important to know that the business isn't different than our expectations.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And sequentially into the first quarter, does that business normally improve sequentially or how should we think about that?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think what you'll start to see – we'll get some of the benefit of the synergies in the first quarter but it will start to ramp up as you move through the year. And we're still getting our arms around in total what seasonality is going to look like as to how strong it will be. But I think we'll build momentum as we move through the year.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Scott, this is John. I do think it is fair to say, given what Scott said about Russia and the Nordics, the fourth and first quarter it is more seasonal than what you used to see in the old Ball European business.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Last question for me. Just if I look at the comparable EBIT in 2016 I know it came in in your range but it came in near the low end of the range. So does that make the 2017 targets a little bit more of a stretch from here or could you just sort of frame that out a little bit for us?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No. No. Remember that, I think, Scott, end of third quarter we said it's going to be in the range of $1 billion but it could be a light depending on the volumes. We said volumes were a bit softer in Brazil and a little bit softer in Europe and as a result of that we were within spitting distance of that. But it does not change what we see in 2017 at all.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Appreciate all the details. Gentlemen, if you could provide a little bit more detail on the performance improvement plans that you have directed at Europe for this year and what would be involved in those. And then I know it's difficult to talk about volumes given the whole complexion of the business has changed over time but is there a way to talk about how European volumes either from an industry standpoint or relative to your initial numbers going into the quarter progressed and where they stood relative to your expectations. Thanks. And I had a follow on after that.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Let me start, George, and then John can chime in. This is not dissimilar than what we needed to do in Europe a few years ago. We know how to do this. We've done this before. And it's really looking at everything from revenue to mix, customer mix, size mix, everything, all of your costs from things that are variable to things that are fixed. And so it's really going through every line item on your P&L and on your balance sheet frankly to manage it in a tighter way. And so we've got a number of different action items that we need to execute on over the next few years. And then on top of that the synergy realization, we're well on our way to seeing good progress on that front. So it's really every different aspect.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Let me give you a little bit of granularity...
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Performance – go ahead, Scott. Go ahead, John. Sorry.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Just a little bit more granular details to what exactly – when Scott was talking about customer mix and size mix. If you recall the former Ball business was a little bit more weighted towards beer. The business we acquired is a little bit more weighted to soft drink. As we all know, beer is less seasonal than soft drink, particularly in Europe with the Christmas season. And so as we look forward and we're trying to rebalance a variety of different things, you should be thinking about that.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Fair enough. What I was going to ask, so the performance improvement plan would be on top of whatever synergy target you had for Europe for 2017. Would that be fair? Or is it inclusive?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, that's fair. I mean, everything counts right. So the synergy, the things we want to get out of the supply chain, things we want to do from that perspective are part of it but that's not the whole of it. It's every aspect of it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And it's also important to note that – recall the former Ball business back in the 2014 – 2015 timeframe we actually went through a big cost optimization program to get the business in line and we have the same management team that's executing on this.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is there a way to size what the opportunity is in 2017? Should we look at 2014 to 2015 as the goal post to look at for what it could look like in 2017 and 2018?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Let's put it in context. I think when you think about what our business did historically in that and I never like to talk about margins because you had to worry about the metal pass through. But metal has been relative stable. It's typically depending on where metal is it's in the 11% to 13%. I think 2015 we ended up about 11.5% in our old business. The business we acquired, as we've said at the Investor Meeting in December and I think even on the third quarter, it's lower than that. So if you use as a marker what are we trying to drive for, should we be able to get to where the old Ball business was? Yeah. But, as Scott said, it's not going to happen overnight and I think it's a couple year plan. So through the end of 2018, we ought to be able to get there.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, I appreciate that. Last one for me and I'll turn it over. Brazil, can you talk a little bit about the volume trends there? You said some of it was beer, some of it was GDP. What are your customers talking about in terms of growth outlook for 2017? And how are you optimizing capacity around that? Thank you, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good question, George. The macro environment down in Brazil is tough. Volumes are softer in 2017 due to the economy and the GDP is down approximately 3% to 4%. From an overall consumption, just to give you context, the beer, these are Nielsen numbers, beer was down 4.5% for the year and down 10% in the fourth quarter. CSD was down a little over 8% for the year and 16% in the fourth quarter. So what you're seeing is our softness there is just a direct reflection of what's going on. What we're hearing and what we're seeing is when you really start to peel away and look at the economy, real wages have been declining there for about 36 months or so. People expect that to be bottoming out and people expect in the second half of 2017 to have consumption expected to improve because real wages are flattening and perhaps will even reverse from that. That remains to be seen but I think the general consensus of Brazil is that it's reached its worst point right now and now the question is how quickly will it start to rebound and that's the question of the day. What we're seeing in our business, as we said, in the fourth quarter the weather played a big part in the first half of the fourth quarter and recall this is their summer but it really did pick up nicely. I do know that carnival is a little bit later this year. It's at the end of February versus the beginning of February and what impact that will have. It's still within the quarter, so it's unclear. But more importantly, what's going to happen after carnival. But those are the things that's going through. What we're hearing from our customers, candidly, it's a mix. There's been some questions about is the can continuing to grow relative to other substrates? And what I'd tell you is looking at facts and looking at data, you look and we have not seen any change in mix over the past year. So cans are still solidly in the upper 40% of penetration, depending on what statistics you look at, Scobee (24:57) or Nielsen. And I do think that right now the consumer is hurting and that's what's really driving overall beverage consumption down in Brazil.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Thanks, George.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Just, I guess, the South American. Obviously, you mentioned the volume declines but your margins held up pretty well despite that. I guess, can you talk a little bit about what drove that? And then if volumes are sort of more normal this year, is there room for – I know you don't like to talk about margins too much but could margins sort of extend further? Just any color there would be helpful.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. I think as we said in the third quarter, we have a good business down there. We've got scale down there. We've got a great management team down there. And so margins were relatively flat. I think our folks have been managing this volatility down in Brazil quite well. We have been, when I say managing it, managing the supply demand quite well to make sure we're not building inventories too quickly and we're not just sitting on idle capacity. So we have to shut our lines to manage that in the off season, we certainly have and will plan on doing that. So, as we look forward, in terms of the margin of the business, we have a certain level of synergies, expectations down in South America but it's not nearly as large as some of the other places, in part, because it's a well-run business and there wasn't a lot of overlap between what we acquired and what remained from our business going forward. So I wouldn't expect significantly big changes in the margin profile going forward on that. But, as Scott said, in 2016, I'll call it, pro forma year over year, we expect improvement in that business.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to the U.S. now that you've owned the Rexam assets for a little bit, could you just talk a little bit about how much you think you can improve the assets that you acquired? Is there significant potential there?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. Yes, there is. I talked about best practice sharing in my earlier statements, everything from line efficiencies to plant floor system. We had talked in the past that some of these plants were a little under-capitalized relative to what we would describe as state-of-the-art. And so we've been focused on that. As I mentioned, we continue to look at optimizing our footprint to make sure we have the right facilities in the right place to service our customers. Obviously, we announced Reedsville, which was last quarter, I believe and we haven't done anything else. But we continue to look at opportunities like that.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then just final question just on the other line, I guess. It was $23 million with corporate $32 million. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing? I guess, the other pieces are really China and EMEA, just what's happening there.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. China, actually, is stabilizing. We think it is flatter in 2017, and it will still probably be a little bit of a loss at the operating profit line. EMEA is a pretty challenging market. It's pretty volatile. Egypt has been pretty volatile but the business in total is nicely profitable.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And overall can demand generally in that region, whether it's India, whether it's Turkey, whether it's Egypt or it's Saudi Arabia, it's still, like Scott said, it's volatile. But it's still strong. And I just point to India and think about India and the growth that's happened there, we've been waiting for two decades for the can to really take off there. Whether it's at that point, don't know. But we are seeing double-digit improvements in volumes in that part of the world. So it is a strong growth area.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Regarding the Egyptian pound issue, as you think about the rest of the acquired assets from Rexam in the Middle East and maybe some other regions that Ball hadn't participated in, are there other businesses where you think you have that kind of FX exposure or maybe FX risk that you may need to address in one way or the other? Or are you confident that it was just Egypt?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: The Egypt situation was something we inherited and something we've subsequently stopped adding to the exposure. In general, we have less. We used to say dollar or if the euro moved a penny it would move our earnings a penny. That doesn't happen anymore. We're pretty well balanced from a euro/dollar standpoint. We'll probably be affected more on a translation basis as it relates to the ruble. As the ruble strengthens it will help us. But we don't have any big exposures from a currency standpoint.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. And again, remember it was because the pound was frozen. The only other place in the world in which we operate that that's happened in the last decade I think was Argentina and even that was just a very short-term time and we have operations in Argentina that didn't affect us. So, as Scott said, we just inherited a situation that we've been able to put a cap on. Put it that way.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And we're dealing with it.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Great. And then just on metal, we've seen a little bit of inflation and European premium has ticked up a little bit, obviously not nearly as much as a couple years ago. But when you think about the impact of European premium, is there any headwind to you? And do you have the ability to hedge that exposure again relative to two, three years ago?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes, we do have the ability to hedge that and we have put our practices in place as to how we take care of that so we take that risk off the table. So we shouldn't see an impact from European premiums.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess first up going back to, John, the value capture commentary from your last call, is there any update you can share on that as it relates to 2017? And I guess I'm asking because of the context of inflation, which seems to have picked up, whether it's steel, tinplate, energy, or maybe even labor costs. How are you thinking about that particular risk as it relates to Ball in 2017?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, I think in terms of the value capture I think you're referring to, we said and we reaffirmed today that we expect to generate in excess of $150 million of synergy related to that. When you talk about some of the things you talked about, there is inflation. And I just think about steel, and steel is up upper single digits. You talked about energy. We do a pretty good job of managing that. One of the things that actually could be over the next couple of years, there's always a lag around that but could be net benefit to that is we have various mechanisms that we have to pass through the inflation or candidly deflation as well. And over the past couple years we've actually had to pass through deflation. And so in an inflationary environment, we should be able to recapture any costs and through the efficiencies that our folks continue to work on, we think there's – net-net-net it's certainly not a negative. And if we do this correctly and take the costs out appropriately, it could be a positive.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of the $150 million in synergies for 2017, what run rate did you exit out of 2016 into 2017? And maybe, Scott, how should we think about that phasing in of the progression on a quarterly basis for 2017?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: There's not a heck of a lot that we got in 2016 because we closed Millbank right at the end of the year, and so there were costs that were running off in the fourth quarter but not a heck of a lot. As we go into 2017, we'll get a little bit in the first quarter and then things will start ramping up as we get into Q2 and Q3.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: When you think about what we've said here, in 2016, the net synergies were more or less a wash because we had cost to achieve Milbank and other things like that. We'll get a full year's results of Milbank. We will only get a half year results of Charlotte. I said because of the way the inventory builds we'll get three quarters of a benefit of the sourcing side of it. And then as you look at some of the other best practice things, I think those gain momentum as time goes on. And as you're really running full out, which you know is more of a second and third quarter phenomenon than it is a first quarter, that's when we really start to see some of those benefits. And then as we go into 2018, and as we said by through 2018 and 2019, we expect to get another $150 million, and we still see a line of sight to that.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, and just one final one on food. You mentioned aligning the cost structure with the supply/demand situation in the U.S. in your press release. Does that include capacity cuts in metal food cans in year-end? Thanks so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: As you know, we've been embarking on that. That's what the investment in Canton, Ohio and the closure at Weirton, West Virginia is. We've talked about this before on the food side of the business. The volume has been soft, but you also have to realize there are so many different types of SKUs it's not like the beverage can business when you're running 24x7. There are certain lines that are only running 30% to 50% of the time. And so we're actively looking at that all the time, and we are going to make sure that we are focused to ensure our costs are as optimized as possible relative to our revenue base.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Scott. Good morning, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered, John. Is it too early to talk about any kind of impact you're seeing from this talk about border taxes with Mexico, just in terms of beer exports into the U.S.?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, I think it is premature. I'll let Scott talk to it because he's right in the middle of it.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I think we're a long way from actual legislation. We've talked to senior officials both in the administration and the House regarding some of the tax policy items, and there's a whole slew of things that are being talked about. And I believe the net effect of all of the proposals is probably a net positive to us. As it relates to the border tax specifically, the target is not, and I get this from both the administration and the people in the House, the target is not traditional Mexican products, but ones that have been made in the U.S. and are now made in Mexico. And it would strike me that nothing is more traditional than Mexican beer. And remember the size of this that we're importing about 1.5% of our global volume, and the plant we acquired from Rexam in Mexico produces about 2 billion units. Most of that stays in Mexico or goes further south. So I think people are overreacting to that a bit.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Scott, is it also possible to get some sense of what you're seeing in terms of just the mix for the beer, for the brewers down in Mexico because it seems like if you have to ship this stuff a long a way, the can has an advantage in terms of weight and cubing out.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: You're absolutely right, and that's why we have seen great growth in the can with our customer. And that's why you see can as a share of the package mix in there increasing, particularly on the beer side. On the CSD side, it's relatively flat, but certainly on the beer side for exactly you said, it's the most efficient package from a distribution point of view. It's the most sustainable package, and the overall economics of it makes a tremendous amount of sense for them.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then last question. John, you mentioned that you had some new wins in aerospace in January. Can you quantify that for us?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Every month you end up having new wins, but we did win an exciting program. It's a longer term program with NASA that, as you all know, we haven't really been doing a lot with NASA over the past few years because the NASA budgets have been flat to declining, and so I think that was a nice sign going forward. We continue to have great opportunities in the classified world serving the various Department of Defense and intelligence communities. And so as we go forward, we still think there's a lot of great opportunity there. But we're very excited where we are, and we're very excited about where we're going on that business.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, I'll turn it over. Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks, John, Scott, and hope you're doing well. Just back to Europe for a second. I think, Scott, you mentioned volume was a touch lighter than you were expecting. You've obviously talked about these restructuring actions that you're taking or contemplating taking. Can you just help me better understand exactly what's going on there? I think you said nothing is different than what you anticipated when you acquired the business, but something seems to be happening. So can you just help me understand what, if anything, is happening differently than you might have thought six months ago?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I don't know if it's different. I think we run our business a little bit differently than the way it was run before. And so we will take downtime and manage inventories to do the right thing for our business. We're not trying to run things for one quarter, or for the next quarter. And so I think it's just how we manage the assets might be a little bit different, and probably we'll be a little more aggressive going forward, especially as it relates to the balance sheet. John, did you want to say something?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, that's exactly it. Again, don't underestimate. Ball in the past had no exposure to the northern markets, meaning Nordics and Russia, and now we do. And as you know, because of weather those are much more seasonal. And then the other thing is don't underestimate what Scott just mentioned about taking downtime on our manufacturing to make sure that the – we're an EVA company. And that's the right EVA decision to do. And so taking downtime because the inventories were getting a little large was the right thing to do to position ourselves for 2017.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just one follow-up on that. What happened demand-wise such that the inventories got out of whack?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, you know it's – the way I look at it is I think the business was in the first six months of the year that was under different ownership was just running, running, running, running. And when we got a hold of it, just to give you a sense, the overall demand in Europe was up 1%, 1.5% for the full year.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It's typically been 2% to 3%. So that's running (39:52) little bit soft. The fourth quarter is about a 1% increase. So not bad, but not the 2% to 3%. And when you have such a large business, it matters. And when I say it matters is then when you're managing inventories and you're taking down time, that's effectively what was going on and it wasn't a surprise to us. Maybe, candidly, maybe we could have articulated the seasonality a little bit better to you all, but hopefully this clarifies it.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: I wouldn't overread any of this. You know there's not a fundamental change in our business from what we expected.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Okay. Scott, just back – and then you mentioned Brazil. It seems like Brazil is weaker than you would have expected 6 months ago, 12 months ago, whatever the timeframe. Why would that not – the additional weakness in Brazil not affect your ability to hit your 2017 targets?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, it's – I think the biggest – it was really the fourth quarter. Third quarter wasn't weaker, but fourth quarter when you have beer off 10%-plus in terms of consumption, I'm not talking about cans, I'm talking about consumption of beer...
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: And CSD off even more than that, that points directly to the issues I was talking about the weather. I was down in Rio in December and I remember it being in Celsius 15 degrees and raining. It ought to be 25 degrees, 30 degrees and sunny there. I know it's a profound difference. And you combine that with the overall economy and the weakness of it, I think that's what it is. Our business held up well despite that. And I think as we go into 2017 our folks down there have done a very good job of managing supply/demand, making sure inventories aren't getting out of line but at the same time ensuring we have the right packages at the right time for our customers. And as we go through, that's exactly what we see in 2017.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And just one last one, just on Brazil again. Have you hazard a guess as to what industry volumes will be, beer or cans, in 2017 in Brazil just based on whatever it is you know today?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think based on what we know today I would expect it to be a little softer in the first half and a little stronger in the second half, all things being equal and that's largely driven by the expectations of what's going on with the economy. I think that the consumer is still eating and drinking, and I do think if assuming weather is normalized I would expect overall can demand to be relatively flat. We're not probably gaining shares as a percent of the penetration, package penetration, but we're not losing share as well. And so I would expect overall flat volumes for the year but it might be a little softer in the first half and a little stronger in the second half.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, John.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Yes. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered but I did want to ask you all it seems to me that I don't believe beyond the Madrid, Spain plan, I might have missed something that you have a lot going on, on the capital side, which obviously is understanding as you assimilate Rexam. But as you go into 2018 and I know it's early days, do you think you'll need to do more footprint addition? Or do you think that can hold off for longer? And, I guess, what I'm really asking is directionally, do you think that $500 million CapEx number moves upwards or stays where it is next year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We actually spent a little heavier last year than what we had forecasted. We spent about $600 million last year which was actually a good thing because that means John ran through a bunch of those projects that came online in the quarter. So that means we start to get the benefit of that sooner. Every project as it stands on its own merits and its own returns. So we'll see what kind of opportunities. We're still seeing a lot of opportunities. That's why I've said $500 million of CapEx for 2017 because that still has some growth capital in it besides Spain but we'll update you as we go through the year and what the opportunities are. And as we are ready to talk about them publicly, we'll tell you on these calls.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: One of the things that Scott just mentioned is important. We spent a little bit more than we had thought we would in terms of CapEx and despite that, our net debt was below where we had targeted. It was at $6.9 billion versus $7 billion despite the $600 million in CapEx. So it just shows the cash flow capability we have here.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. And then, John, you mentioned you were expanding the aerospace capability out in Colorado. Is this because of a change in the focus of some of the I guess of the governments and other customers away from other folks that do similar things? Is it different programs? Or is it just a general increase in activity?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think it's a combination of all that. When you look back over – and we're investing. It's not huge dollars, number one. I want to make sure that's clear. But we're – it's a capacity issue. We don't have enough manufacturing space to execute on all the wins that we've gotten. Those wins have come from a combination of, number one, the government hasn't spent a lot of money in some of these strategic, I would call it these higher strategic classified programs, and we're gaining more than our fair share in it. Number two, I think there's a lot of new technologies out there. And you just think in the commercial world what's been going on, and you translate that into using technologies to do some of the things for the government in a different way. That's another part of it. And then I just think overall growth. And I think about our tactical products part of the business that makes the sensors, makes the antennas for the joint strike fighter, for example. That is ramping up in a meaningful way. We've only made probably less than 100 planes as a country in that. And they have plans for making hundreds upon hundreds of those. So as that ramps up, we too have to ramp up our capabilities to supply the sensor suites and the antennas we're due for that. So that's just one example of what we're talking about.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. What's driving just marginally weaker volumes out of Europe? I know there's been some supply constraints. Is that part of that? And as we look out to 2017, should we expect volumes to track closer to 2% to 3% this year? Just wanted to get some puts and takes. And then just lastly, that market has been pretty tight. Could we see some commercial improvements this year?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think to answer your question, no, it hasn't been supply constraint. It is a tight market but I don't believe it's been supply constrained. Remember, the economies in Europe continue to be weak. They continue to be weak and real wage growth is non-existent there. The population is getting a little bit older. And so until you see some economic activity there, I think that's a part of it. I also think the weather's been part of it. The weather throughout Europe, and when you look over the balance of the whole year, it was on par. A little bit colder, a little bit wetter than what you're traditionally used to. The benefit the can has we continue to win share as a percent of the package mix. And I still think those are – you're seeing continued improvements in those categories, whether it's in the north, south, east or west. So what does that mean as we look into 2017? It's too early to predict because you can't predict weather. But we see nothing fundamental, nothing structural that would change that 2% to 3% growth rate over the next number of years.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Our business is just a little more seasonal than it was before. So that's part of it.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And I guess maybe a question for you, Scott. Maybe this is a dumb question. But for Europe, you called out margins were impacted a bit by step-up in the fixed assets and due to just a bigger mix in the assets you acquired. But I would have thought the operating earnings adjustment will kind of strip down any step up from D&A. Can you just quantify the impact and explain it a little bit more?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, you have to step the depreciation on the assets, so there's going to be about $4 million per quarter in additional depreciation on those assets. What we kind of exclude is the amortization of the customer intangibles but the asset write-up will flow through the P&L.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Okay, that's helpful.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Okay (48:30)
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: And then, I guess, switching gears a little bit, tinplate prices I would expect is going up, are you expecting any short-term mismatch from a price/cost standpoint on the positive side or negative side? I know in the past there's been some noise around that when you see moves on tinplate prices. thanks.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, tinplate, as I mentioned earlier, tinplate pricing is going up, probably upper single digits. But I think you talk about any noise, I don't think there's any appreciable noise. You obviously have inventory built up and things like that but it's also how you pass through these things with customers. So I wouldn't read into it too much.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had two questions. One broader on North America and then one about your guidance. I think this was the first year since 2010, if you include Canada, where North America saw volumes increase for the beverage can. And I was wondering, it's kind of interesting to me, do you think that that is a trend that is sustainable? We talked a lot about things that are helping such as specialty cans and beer growth specifically craft beer, but that hasn't seemed to offset the weakness in years prior. What are you expecting for the next two or three years?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Debbie, it's a great question and 2016 was the first year in many years that the overall can market was up. Beer for the last number of years has actually been doing well. What was most exciting was that the non-alcoholic side for the year was actually in positive territory. We've talked about these 3% to 4% declines since 2008 – 2009. And so what you're seeing is you saw positive. Really, there are many things that are driving that. I think the shift to smaller sizes is driving that, which is part of it. When people are drinking less soft drink in total literage but they still want their servings, and so the smaller sizes are helping. And I just think the overall repositioning of the sparkling side of the world, when I say sparking, it's not just CSD but it's also sparkling waters. And then as you mentioned on the beer side, things have been going well. It's been a little bit challenging, I'd describe it mainstream brands, but in terms of some of the other things, craft that you mentioned and some other places and the proliferation of different sizes has been a net benefit. So is it a secular thing? Time will tell. But certainly the tone and tenor and the discussions with our customers as we sit here today is a lot more constructive than it's been over the last three, four, or five years in terms of their use of metal packaging in their overall mix profile.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then my second question on the guidance commentary, Scott, you said comparable operating guidance you confirmed of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2017. When I run that through my model, you exceed the 20% EPS growth that you targeted or highlighted earlier. And maybe I need to do this offline, but I'm just wondering if that's a fair statement. And then what D&A are you expecting in the 2017 as well with the step up?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: We said 20% to 30%, and we have I think it's about $430 million – $440 million of depreciation and amortization, and that excludes the amortization of the customer intangible, which will run about $1.30 billion to $1.40 billion.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: But, Debbie, to answer your question, you're right, we stand by the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We said $280 million of interest expense. We said tax would be at 28% and interest count would be around 178 million shares absent any share repurchase. So when you do that math, you're absolutely right. And that's why we've said 20% to 30%. Nothing has changed by that, and that's what we stand by.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Scott, I wondered if you could – I know you don't have the full cash flow statement filed yet but maybe give us a couple – or a read around a couple of components. What was the working capital component that you had embedded into 2016, and then how are you thinking it looks in 2017?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: In 2017, I think we have a small – we have a source of capital, about $100 million of working capital that will benefit us in 2017. We also, in that free cash flow guidance, pension will be a little bit of a negative from a cash flow standpoint year over year in 2017 versus 2016. I don't have all the components of working capital. All I know is the net debt, despite us spending $40 million – $50 million more in – actually about $60 million more in capital, the debt came in lower than what we were expecting. It came in below $7 billion. So we did a heck of a job on working capital, but I don't have those components yet.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then when we think about – you had targeted some share repurchase in 2017 I think in earlier presentations and slide decks and things that there could be some towards the end of the year. But is there anything – if you're feeling pretty confident and have the line of sight that you talked about into this being a $750 million to $850 million year and still the different cash and EBITDA target down in the future, is there anything that prohibits you from buying shares earlier in 2017 as opposed to later?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, we don't have any prohibition. In fact, we bought some shares in the fourth quarter when the stock got particularly soft. But our orientation is to get, as we progress through the year and our numbers firm up and we feel better about them and feel there's a decent line of sight to that 3.5 times, then we'll be more active. But we're sitting here, it's February 5 or something, so it's early. So I'm always ahead of the game.
Operator: And we have...
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Okay, please go ahead.
Operator: So we have another follow-up question. It is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. I'll try to make it quick because I know we're late in the call. Some of the work that we've done, we've seen cans continue to take share within custom and within the beer market overall. And from our vantage point, one of the things that has helped that has been the proliferation of customers use of craft beers. You've called it out. Now having said that, we've also seen craft slow down in recent quarters. What are your customers telling you, if anything, about whether that's a sustained trend or whether you should expect continued growth in craft, and with it, if you buy the premise, good growth for the can? That's question one. Question two would be back on border tax and deductibility. Some of your customers have talked about sourcing their COGS in North America if in fact the water flows under the bridge and you do have some border deductibility issue. Recognizing it's early, it would seem that cans would have a little bit more, again, ability to help in that regard relative to some of the other packaging stuff, but could you comment at all in that regard? Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, George. This is John. I will try and take it, yes. Overall craft beer consumption has slowed down. The can, however, continues to take share in that. And just to give you a sense in our portfolio, for the 2016, craft cans were up about 28% or so, close to 30%. What's interesting when you peel that away, and we've talked about this before, the bigger brands are growing a little bit more slowly than the smaller brands. You know, our top 5 customers grew at about 10%, 15% while the rest of them grew at about 40%. And so what you're seeing is this long tail where many of these smaller brewers that were only in bottles, now they're moving to cans. And I think some of the larger brands have already moved into cans. But overall, I'll still take 10% to 15% growth on the big ones and 40% on the little ones. That's what we're seeing in the craft beer industry. As it relates to what you were saying about Mexico, the only thing I'll point out is we source all of our aluminum from American facilities. And so when you think about these various issues, that actually is another thing that helps out, all things being equal, relative to what you were just talking about. I do think if we say anything more than that, we're just prematurely speculating. As Scott said, we're going to have to see what all shakes out here, but I do think that that is a net plus for the metal beverage can.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Appreciate it. That's what we thought. We'll turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks, George.
Operator: And I'm showing no further question at this time, sir.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Maleka. Thank you for your help and thanks for everyone participating. We look forward to a very exciting, strong, and healthy 2017 and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, the call is being recorded, Thursday, November 3, 2016. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John Hayes. Please proceed.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2016 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding descriptions of our new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true. I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics. And then, I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future. We're pleased that the new combined business, as well as our existing businesses, are right on track versus our expectations and the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace. Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call. During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway. In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products, while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistic and footprint optimization, as well as ongoing cost-saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices. Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized. In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued ramping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced salable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously-initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December of 2015. We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period, and we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement, largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run-up of our share price, as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt payoff, a higher share count and tax rate. Our GAAP results in the first nine months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in note two of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week. Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities, plus the nine acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter, and on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter. Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make production strides and Mexican domestic and export demand remains strong. Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV, are not consolidated and therefore are included in equity earnings of affiliates. Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consists of the 12 acquired facilities, plus two legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand, as well as our volume in the quarter, was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries. The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply-demand conditions in the region. The beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply-demand remains tight and specialty demand remains favorable with a bias towards continued shift into specialty. As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring and the plant will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth. Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China/Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity in going forward, we will include a footnote in note two of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other. Of note, the UAC JV, 51% investment, is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment and the 49% outflow is reflected in non-controlling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals and the team in EMEA is fitting right in at Ball. The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately. Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit 2017 performance. In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to our global packaging team members, as well as the corporate support teams. Your collaboration and dedication is appreciated. As I mentioned on the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. You'll notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release. During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees, $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives, $65 million in advisor, attorney and banker fees, $50 million in tax payments, a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment, and we spent $125 million in CapEx. Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to flow a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours. Regardless, we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates. As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter. Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%. Corporate undistributed is now expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte, as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017, and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near-term. To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the costs will be reflected from a reporting perspective. Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017 and we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call. We will not be posting a slide every quarter. For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint; 1 billion more units through our new Monterrey plant; cost-out benefits from the F&A metal service center transition; as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth; improvement in aerospace and the full year impact of the acquisition. And by 2019, we aspire to be generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and generating in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. Our December investor field trip will also provide another chance to add to our messaging and engage in Q&A about our progress. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off. Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is a 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts, which will benefit the remainder of 2016, and more importantly, beyond. Now, across the company and as we look forward, we're on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us and while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these. In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone has taken to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done and we're focused on our balance sheet, cost-out, footprint, supply-demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader. As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3 to 3.5 times, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And with that, James, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning and congratulations on the Cubs.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Scott, just a couple of questions on guidance. I think you talked about full year operating earnings in the range of $1 billion. I think previously you had said just north of $1 billion. Is it possible to size that delta, if there is one and what's driving it? And then apologies if I missed this, but with the previous CapEx guidance of $500 million, or around $500 million, did that include the Madrid expansion?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure. On the $1 billion, it's dynamic, obviously, but if things go well, if volumes go well, we could exceed $1 billion. If things are a little lighter and softer, we might be a little bit short, but I don't think it's a gigantic range. And then as it relates to the capital, yes, one of the things we had planned for some time now is the expansion in Madrid. So in that $500 million for next year is a good chunk of that to build out Madrid.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, in your comments, you talked about fighting for a proportionate share of volumes. I'm just wondering if you could talk generally about the commercial environment that you've seen since the closure of the merger. Have you seen share shift or a significant change in customer inquiries? If you can just kind of talk generally about the commercial environment?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Nothing out of the ordinary is what I'd say. As we have moved forward, we have talked about this before. We have some new muscles in terms of our relative position and we're developing those and trying to flex them. As I did say in our prepared remarks, we are trying to get value for the products we deliver and we've had discussions with our customers, like we always do. As we mentioned in prior times, we're very much customer-focused and some of those discussions go easy, some of them are challenging at times, but there's nothing appreciable that's out of the ordinary.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay and then maybe just one last one. Is it possible to say what level of working capital benefit is baked into the 2017 free cash flow target?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: There was about $100 million of working capital benefit for 2017...
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: ... in the numbers we previously gave.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. I will turn it over.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. John, Scott, hope you're well. Scott, just one more on the 2016 comparable earnings target. It seems like corporate is $10 million higher than you were expecting before. Is food and aerosol any lower – is your expectation any lower now than it was before and have any other particular buckets changed?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, I think, to the first point on the corporate undistributed, it's not really that it's higher. It's just in a different bucket than the one we previously had anticipated. What we're going to do with some of the pension costs going forward is, if they weren't related – we've retained some of the German pensions, for example. And so next year, we'll move some of the German costs for those pensions into corporate undistributed because they really don't relate to the business. So it's really more of just where we're reporting those numbers. It's not really an increase in cost.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: As it relates to the second part, food had a little softer quarter in the third quarter, but I think the fourth quarter should be okay, and so that plays into the number. Like we said, it's a big business that we're getting our arms around and I think doing really well. We just want to make sure that we're clear. And could there be a little variability to that number? Yeah, I think there could.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But just to be clear – no, I hear that, Scott. Just to be clear, on a segment basis, have your expectations changed for the full year?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, not at all. Not for this year and not really for next year. If anything, we're 120 days into this and I think we're more excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that. And just a couple others, one on the aforementioned food can business. Can you guys just talk about the volume decline that you've experienced and what drove that and the extent to which you think it's one-time or that it won't recur for several more quarters?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Well, as we said I think in our earnings release, Adam, it was really just two things. Number one, the salmon business, as you know, that has over time been a pretty volatile business and it was a poor salmon harvest this year. So that was definitely one of them. The other one was just in our existing customer base, the demand side on the customer didn't perform as well as we had thought. We've talked in the past that we had some share shifts, but that had nothing to do with – in the quarter. It was just a little bit softer. Some of it bled over into October, but we don't expect October to be meaningfully different than it was last year. And so I just think it was a little bit softer harvest than we had expected.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, John. And just one on South America, you talked about the market being relatively flat. Do you have any reason – and obviously some of your large customers have expressed disappointment about the market of late. Do you have any reason to expect a change in market demand in the foreseeable future? And relatedly, do you have any thoughts about the potential for additional capacity to be added in that market as demand remains fairly sluggish?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Well, as you know, the Brazilian economy has been challenged economically, so I will start with there. I do know that can, however, continues to perform relatively well overall. For example, overall beer volumes were down a couple percent in the quarter and the cans were flat, which means it continues to take share from other substrates. I think as we go forward, we continue to expect that. I do think that some of the reforms that Brazil is pushing through gives better confidence over the longer term in terms of the economy improving and the middle class growing, which is real important, as you know, for overall beverage consumption. There has been discussions about new capacity coming on. It's reasonably tight right now. So as I said on the call last quarter, we're certainly aware of that. We don't think there's going to be any appreciable dislocations because Brazil does have a lot of embedded growth. They're just going through some short-term economic pain.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much, John. Best of luck.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, good morning, thanks. Just had a question in terms of the $150 million of synergies you're looking for 2017. Do you have a rough sense on how much the closing of Millbank and then Charlotte would contribute towards that?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I think what we said on last quarter, nothing really has changed. Millbank between those two things, we had $70 million, $80 million of costs in that range and we expect to get most of it out. We'll have a little bit because there is some incremental support that's required for all those acquired facilities, but I think what we talked about was $60 million, $70 million of total cost that we expect to be able to get out of that.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just, I guess, with South America, the new margins that you reported this quarter were a decent amount above year-ago levels, which were sort of your older assets. And in Europe, it's kind of the opposite, the margins now with, I guess, the Rexam assets were lower than yours. Can you just talk high level what's driving those changes? Is it businesses or is it any sort of one-time items? Just some color there would be great.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, first, I caution not only with both of those, but with all of them, the comparability, if you want to call it that, of these segments is a little apples and oranges just because you're comparing a legacy Ball business, much of what you just described in South America and more importantly in Europe, we divested. And so that's the apple and then the pear or the other fruit is what we have going forward. Having said that, I would say in South America, we have – as we've talked before, it's a good business with a great management team. We've got scale, which is real important there. And when you have a footprint that you can leverage in a way much greater than we were able to with kind of three facilities, you can see some of the benefit. I do think in Europe that there is some opportunity. Our business – our legacy business margins were a little bit better than the business we acquired. We knew that going in. There were no surprises there. And so our opportunity in some of the cost-out that I mentioned, whether it's Berlin or whether it's some other things, we think there's opportunity, again, because of the scale of the business. It's a bigger business than we've either had. So over the next couple of years, we expect to drive continued improvement in the European segment.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And just last question, again, within sort of food and aerosol. I think a couple quarters ago, you commented that it was your goal basically to get EBIT in that segment back to where it had been historically. Is that still a reasonable goal in your view?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, I think it is a reasonable goal. As I said, we're a little bit softer in the third quarter, but other times, sometimes we're a little bit stronger. I think as we look forward, what we talked about before in terms of the service center realignment that's going on that we're going to get the benefit of 2017, we're investing in the Czech Republic to grow the impact extruded side of that business that's going to come on stream late this year, early next year. We have a new plant in India that up until recently really hasn't even been generating anything because it was in startup mode. And then, we've invested in the UK in terms of impact extruded. That combined with just the overall continued growth, for example, in our Mexican impact extruded says that over the next couple of years, we expect to be able to get in the range of where we had been before.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please proceed.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just going back to South America for a couple minutes, just to clarify a couple things. I realize we're comparing apples and oranges here, but there was a pretty significant delta on the margins in the legacy Ball facility versus what you did acquire. And this is kind of our first look into some of the margins in that market. Is it really just a scale issue? I heard you mention that as being one of the big drivers or is there anything else that made the margins between those two businesses different?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: As I said, scale is real important in this business. And just, for example, we had G&A that supported three plants. We don't have that much more appreciable G&A that's supporting 13 plus plants in that region. And so that's just one example of it. There's many others we can give, but scale is important in our business.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: But also remember, Scott, last year in the third quarter, we had a pretty tough quarter. So you're comparing something that was unusually low too, so you've got to be careful with the comparisons.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, that's a fair point, Scott. I appreciate you highlighting that. And then, one other on South America, it sounds like one of your larger customers recently talked about reinvesting in glass bottles for off-premise consumption. And I realize that can continues to take market share in the long run, but are you seeing anything in the near-term just given the macro environment where you're seeing maybe a shift back towards glass in the near-term? Is that something you're seeing?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No. As I said, for example, in the third quarter, can continued to gain share relative to glass and we are entering the summer, so – and it's still early in their summer season, but so far so good. But we haven't seen any appreciable change from the trends we've talked about previously.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. One last one for me. John, you mentioned this a couple of times. You talk about securing appropriate value for the product and some of that was prefaced on sourcing freight and logistics, but I got the sense that maybe you feel like maybe that you've not been getting full value for the product over the last couple of years maybe because of competitive dynamics or something else in the market. How should we read that commentary?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Read it as exactly what the words that came out of my mouth. We think that the beverage can is the most sustainable package from an economic perspective. And while at the same time, we want to make sure we're getting paid for our innovation efforts. And we put a lot of effort and energy into the specialty can size and growth and development of not only the can itself, but the market itself. You think about the aluminum bottles, you think about the service that we provide, you think about the quality we provide, and my comments stand on their own two feet.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And the complexity of the business is way different. We need to make sure that we're getting paid appropriately for that complexity.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I mean, another example on that is, given the retail environment, there's a lot of movements and shifts in terms of in and out packages. And so when you contract on a standard 12 ounce can basis and you have long runs, it's changing today. So that's just another example of how we've to modify our muscle memory to reflect the current realities.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. I really appreciate that. I guess one follow-up on that. You can see from some of the customers, they're able to significantly – up-charge significantly from a customer perspective with some of these new can sizes. For instance, moving from a 12 ounce to a 7.5 ounce doesn't just get you – on the CSD side, doesn't just get you more per ounce for the beverage guys, it actually gets you more on the total dollar amount. I mean did they recognize that value as well or not?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. Look, let me attack it a little bit different way. When we're able to help our customers grow their profits and grow their profit pools, there's greater money to go around. What we try and do is actually make the can the most sustainable package and make it to become the most profitable package for our customer. That's our aspiration, because if we can do that, that's what we mean about being the most sustainable package in the beverage world.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I do see a lot more cans in other things like sparkling water these days.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: There we go.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So it's interesting to see the growth. I appreciate it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: One customer at a time.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good. Thanks.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Just piggybacking off of that last question in terms of value capture, is there a particular region where you feel value isn't up to par or is it just broad-based across your entire portfolio?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, generally speaking, it's broad-based, but specifically when you think about the greatest amount of changes in terms of the package sizes, shapes, those types of things, I would certainly say Europe and North America.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, makes sense. Thanks. And then, can you give us some clarity on your expected synergy on a run rate by the end of 2016? I know you guys gave – you reiterated your 2017 and 2019 targets, but just what you guys expect to achieve by 2016 on a run rate?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes, we never gave a number for 2016. We gave a 2017 number. So we have lots of plans in place, a lot of things that are progressing as we expected. And that's why we're reiterating the number for 2017. It's the same as what we told you a couple months ago.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. For 2016, as we said before, the second half of 2016 is as much about getting after – from an integration point of view, getting after those cost synergies that we're able to deliver on in 2017. So you shouldn't expect too much in 2016.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah. There's probably a little bit of drag actually in 2016 as we get after some of that stuff.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Makes sense. Just one last one and relatedly, has there been an impact on synergies from the recent pound devaluation? And if so, how are you offsetting that to stay at your targets?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Our pound business actually isn't that big. And then today, the UK Court said the vote for Brexit was illegal and that Parliament has to vote, so the pound popped. So it's a dynamic world.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. And remember, the UK business as a percent of our revenues is south of 5%, so it's not a big driver.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the closing, and again, also on the Cubs. I guess my first question, Scott, I forget if you mentioned it, the cash costs associated with the integration, has that changed at all, or is that very much on track with your expectations for both 2016 and 2017? Has there been any change in the timing there of?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No. No real change, George. Everything that we expected to happen in the third quarter post-close is exactly what happened at the costs we anticipated. And as we look into 2017, and any actions we might take there, none of those costs have changed.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for that. I don't think you could provide a lot of detail and clarity on this for various reasons, but could you give us some qualitative view on how customer specialty did by region within your business?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'm sorry. You said specialty?
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, correct.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. Yeah, let me just quickly try and go through it. I think the overall trends that we've talked about really haven't changed at all that much. And what I mean by that, in North America, we continue to see – on a pro forma basis, again, you have to keep that in mind, but we were up high single-digits in the United States and North America, that segment. In Europe, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, but as we talked in our prepared remarks, there continues to be a bias towards specialty. And so that's been growing at a faster rate than the standard containers. And then, when you go into other regions, whether it's South America or even Asia, you're continuing to see specialty can growth higher and in the case of Asia much higher than you are standard containers.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Appreciate that, John. One thing I wanted to ask, Scott, is the Madrid plant. Can you provide a little bit more color? I think you said it was an existing contract you had that you elected to keep and you're building this new facility. If there's any more commentary you could share around it. I forget if you said how large the facility was going to be. And then I had one last follow-up before I turn it over.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure. This is a customer we've been selling to for a while. We were servicing them out of another plant that was outside of Spain in the old Ball legacy business. During the process of working with the EC, we kept that particular contract, which was a long multiyear contract, way beyond five years, which is the anchor tenant of all that volume. It'll initially – the plant will come up in 2018 with one line and then another line added after that. And so a vast majority of it is contracted and then the Spanish market continues to be one of the better markets across Europe and so we'll be able to grow with that market.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Scott. As you think about Mexico, given the potential for various outcomes post-election, is the way you're planning for that business to progress or develop, or for that matter, the way your customers are planning, has any of that changed over the last six months relative to where we are right now? And then, I don't know if you have a quick update on Chinese pricing and the outlook for 2017, but I figured I'd throw that in there? Thank you, guys. Good luck.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: All right. Why don't I tackle Mexico right now? No, no changes. As you know, we make in Mexico and sell in Mexico. Now, the finished product is often exported in the United States, but it really plays into the broader demographics that's going on there. I think you're intimating what happens in the election. I think it's premature to speculate there, but I – it's challenging to think that there is going to be meaningful changes in domestic consumption here in the U.S., given the demographics that have gone on, certainly in the next few years. So we don't see any change based relative to where we were six months or even a year ago.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But would you consider maybe tightening up the cost structure if currencies further devalue? I guess that was part of the question.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: The cost structure is really – we've pretty much inoculated ourselves from Mexican currency swings because it's really a dollar-based business.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you for that.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yeah, so no change. (36:36)
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. Then in the China market, we're right in the early part of the throes of the annual price negotiations. As you all know, we took a big step-down last year. Relative to our expectations, we still think there's oversupply in the market. We still think it's challenging. We also know that a lot of can makers that are publicly traded over there have publicly expressed that they are quite challenged in the market. So I think it's premature to determine exactly what's going to happen, but we've taken a ton of cost out in that business in 2016. We have further plans to do that and we kind of think we've hit a low point. But having said that, it is early November and the pricing discussions haven't been finalized.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Congratulations on the progress.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Thank you.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Hi. Good morning, John and Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: First question is, I guess we really appreciate the detail and it's pretty noticeable that if you look at the first half results in Asia, they were – actually, it looks like negative $13 million. And of course, that's just legacy Ball. And then, in the third quarter, they shot up to $22 million, as you indicated. Interpolating from the other line, of course. I didn't know if all of that improvement was Rexam or are there other moving parts?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: No, if you looked at the Asia business alone, we took a big hit in the first quarter. We had inventory revaluation down, which was a big impact in the first quarter. So the first quarter was particularly rough. It has progressively gotten better, as we've gotten the cost out too. Remember, we had a pretty significant cost-out plan and that has matured through the first quarter into the third quarter and that's why sequentially we've gotten better as the year has gone on.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah, but I think to answer your other part of the question, the other remember also includes EMEA and that is a profitable business. So we've made a lot of good progress in China, but don't – I think you're intimating it went from negative $13 million in the first half to positive $22 million.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: That's right, that's right.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Yeah. And then actually to be fair, it was positive $15 million in the first half of 2015, but I appreciate that answer about the first quarter. That's right. And the other thing that really sticks out, of course, is the margin that we see in South America and how much better it looks like, at least it appears to be at with the Rexam assets. And of course, that's even with a little bit of a hand tied behind your back with the stepped-up depreciation. I'm sure there's a little bit of that. And is that all of it? Was it just the differential in the businesses you acquired versus what you had before? And I guess there was a divestiture maybe in there as well. And is this sustainable, this sort of 18% to 19% EBIT multiple we saw in the third quarter?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Remember, what you're comparing to was a really soft quarter in our legacy business in the third quarter of last year. So you're really not comparing – making a fair comparison. But the business that we acquired is a much bigger business that has a lot more scale and is a very well run business. Now, where the margins go over time, we will see. But it's a good business.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes, the other thing, as you all know, we never really talk about margins because metal pass through is such a big component. With aluminum being softer, it makes the margin look higher. We look at the return on capital. And that's a better way to be looking at it. So I wouldn't read too much into these margin things that you're mentioning.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. And then on the plant in Madrid, I mean as I look at it, it looks like you have an aluminum aerosol plant starting up in the Czech Republic and that's basically it until Madrid. And given that you're working hard on all the synergies, I would imagine, I mean, that can change, but that's really the only thing that's out there. And should I assume it's like, what, 800 million cans per line, one in 2018 and one in 2019? Is that a good ballpark?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: It's a good ballpark. Like Scott said, we're going to be putting this first line in and then kind of ramping up and building infrastructure for the second line. And so the timing of it is dependent upon how the Spanish market continues to grow. But in terms of your broader question about CapEx, we have been spending a fair amount of money. And you mentioned – actually just to be clear, we're not building a new plant in the Czech Republic. We're significantly expanding an existing plant, but we continue to make specialty can investments in our business. We talked about in North America on the last conference call that there is some capital that's going to be required to upgrade the facilities we acquired. So there's a whole bunch of distributed things like that. And we stand by what we said in the range of $500 million for next year.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Okay and last quick one. I know the depreciation – this is the first look we've had with the step-up. If you annualize the fourth quarter, I guess it would be what, 456? Isn't that a good ballpark to be in next year, is the 450 range?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes. That sounds about right, and then add the amortization that we're going to exclude is on top of that, but that's (42:04)
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Which is 132 give or take?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Correct.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. That's good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to a strong – what sounds like a strong first 120 days or so.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Thanks.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Let's see here, so a couple questions I wanted to ask. I think I understand what's happening in Spain, but I wanted to also dive into the aerospace business a little bit. The backlog's up quite a bit. If we look back historically, 2012, 2013, 2014, you've been $900 million plus of revenue there before. What do you think the path is towards monetizing some of that backlog? Should 2017, 2018 be $900 million plus revenue kind of numbers, or what's the path there?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. I think the path – I mean, we have a record amount of backlog and it's obviously a very good story there. I think as time goes on, we're going to be able to surpass what we've done in the past in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability. I mentioned on last quarter that we had a lot on our plates in terms of won, not-booked and the biggest surprise that happened in the third quarter for us is, given that the government pushed out the continuing resolution until after the election, we were pleasantly surprised and so some of the wins turned into funded wins, which went into our backlog. We're still chasing a variety of things in the aerospace business. And even getting back to the capital, I think over the next couple of years, it's not big dollars, but we're going to be investing in that in terms of new chambers, in terms of expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity, and building out some of our existing facilities because our backlog is the highest we've ever had it and we're ramping up big time in terms of hiring people, getting people going. And as I mentioned, I think you're going to start to see it roll out as early as the fourth quarter 2016. And then as we go to 2017 and beyond, we feel good about that business. They've been doing a great job.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question I had was – and I fully appreciate you're going to have an Analyst Day event for us in a few months. But given that the business, particularly in Europe and in South America, is quite different than your historic business, or at least the footprint to an extent is, help us get – give us a sense of what you would anticipate, say, the next one, two, three years, the organic growth profile of the new Ball business looks like. And even in North America too, given that maybe we've had a bit of an inflection point here.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: There's a very long answer to that. I would encourage you to come to the investor conference and hear directly from our presidents in that region. That's part of what we're planning on doing – explaining what we see from a demand perspective, a supply perspective, a footprint perspective, a size, shape, capacity, innovation, all those various things at the Investor Day.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. I'll wait for that. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: All right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please Proceed.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. It sounds like what you're seeing – some increased momentum there. Can you provide some color what kind of trends you're seeing and how should we think about mix relative to your business in Europe going forward?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? You were breaking in and out.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Yes, sure. Russia seems to be gaining a bit of momentum here. Can you talk about what's driving the growth; where you see that market taking off next year and what kind of impact should we think about from a mix standpoint?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Yes, the Russia market is good. It's a good business. It's a growing business. The can continues to do well and we would expect that to continue going forward.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Any big delta from a margin standpoint relative to Europe, positive or negative?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, not appreciably.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, is the short answer.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And I don't know if I missed this; piggybacking off of Chris' question about the aerospace business, backlogs have obviously picked up pretty meaningfully. How quickly of a ramp do we expect to see that flow through your P&L? And are there any startup costs we need to be mindful of in terms of that potentially impacting margins?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, there are no start-up costs and it's going to be ramped up as we go and really get going. It's a difficult question to answer because as we have – like, and every time we have some contracts that are coming off, some contracts that are coming on. I will point out a couple things though. The majority of the business we've won is a cost-plus business, cost-plus fixed-fee business. And that usually – we've talked about this in the past. When you have a fixed-price contract, usually the margins when you start out are a bit lower. And then, if you execute successfully, your margins will pick up as you deliver those. In a cost-plus environment, it's a little bit more stable. The margin is across, so I don't expect our margin profile, having said that, to change meaningfully as we look forward. I think it's as much about growing the revenues. And some of these programs we've won are multi-year programs. Some of them are single year. It's a big mix, but the vast majority of this is cost-plus, which is actually good from an overall profitability perspective.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. And just one last one from me, I know one of your partners in Mexico announced they're acquiring a brewery in Mexico. Is that an opportunity for you to slide in from an existing facility, or through potentially more capacity down the road? Just want to talk about the opportunity down the road. Thanks. Appreciate it.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. We've got a very good relationship with that customer you're mentioning. I think it's premature and it's not fair for us to comment on what some of their plans are. I'll just say that we have a very good relationship with them to supply 100% of their needs in Mexico.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO. Please proceed.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Good morning John. Good morning Scott.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just actually following on Mexico, John, is it possible to get some sense of what you're seeing in terms of the can's share of the mix for both domestic and exported beer out of Mexico?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yes. I don't have them off the top of my head. Some observations though high level is, number one, the can penetration is certainly lower in Mexico than it is in North America. Number two, it – and I say that on the beer side, I want to say it's in the 20%s versus 50%s here in North America. So there's a lot of good runway there. And I think as a lot of the Mexican beer companies look to develop their brands, they recognize they've been underweighted cans relative to glass and other substrates, and so they've been putting much more emphasis on the can, which I think longer term and shorter term is a benefit for us.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. What about on the export side? Do you have any sense of the export mix, how much of that is going in cans and how much is going in bottles and how that might shift?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Yeah. It's the same trend. Historically, it had been more weighted towards glass than it had been cans. And I think as we look now and going forward, we are seeing a greater weight of cans relative to glass for the export.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then I'm just curious, over the last 90 days, you've said no changes to any of your targets. But has there been anything that you would highlight over the last 90 days as you've kind of gotten into Rexam much deep (49:47) that surprised you at all one way or the other?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: On the conference call three months ago, our initial observations was the engagement of the people was awesome and we'd reiterate that. Great bunch of people who were very excited and I think as time goes on – we had a management conference; got the top 300 plus people in a room together, and really galvanized about who we are, what we're trying to do and how we are going to get there and what each and every person's role is and really this behaved like a true owner, as I talked about in my opening remarks. That's a positive. I think in terms of – when you peel away the onion, there's always puts and takes, but, as Scott had mentioned, we see some – we have to firm these things up, but we see some opportunities on the cost side, whether it's footprint, whether it's supply-demand dynamics, whether it's best practice sharing in the manufacturing footprints, all those things. We're getting after it now. And as we dig into it, we're excited.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Scott, I'm curious, with that Rexam headquarters wind-down, is there any potential benefit for you in terms of being able to sell the remaining years on the lease?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: My experience is – we're going to try to re-lease the property. We don't own it.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: There's usually not a huge upside. I mean the market is higher than it was when we entered the lease, so maybe there's a little bit, but that's rounding.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Okay. All right. That's good. Final question I had, any way to quantify the benefit from aluminum premiums in the third quarter?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Nothing for us really.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Sounds good. I'll turn it over.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. A large brewer recently said that they're starting to see some slowdown in the craft beer market and I'm just curious if you guys are seeing that as well with some of your customers. I know I think last quarter you said it was growing at 30% year-to-date, but just what are you expecting going forward from that?
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: No, it's still growing strong. I think what that – whoever was mentioning that – you have seen a change though. I think some of the larger craft brewers have slowed down. The top 10 brands in the craft brewing side has slowed down, but on the other side of the curve, many of the smaller ones, they continue to grow very strong on the can side because they were in glass historically, or they did not exist. And so we continue to see a strong uptick in some of the smaller craft beers going into cans.
Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then sorry to go back to the new facility in Spain. I'm just trying to fully understand, it's a customer that you are servicing now, so are you guys seeing increased cost maybe from transportation or whatnot that this kind of new facility is more of a cost-saving with some added growth to it, or how should we think about that?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Well, we were servicing out of a new facility that we had to divest.
Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: So that business will come when we get that plant up and running.
Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: And it will be much more beneficial from a cost standpoint because it'll be very closely located to where all that volume's going.
Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. All right. Thank you. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hello, again, gentlemen. Just one quick follow-up for Scott, and if you have the answer for this handy, that would be wonderful. If not, if you could get back to us. But wanted to get a sense of the pension, where we are today, where we are heading into 2017. Mainly, what is the liability so that we can try to calculate some sensitivities on what happens with stuff, but your expectations for what the liability is, what the funding level is and how that might play out into 2017 as well?
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure. I don't have the exact liability numbers with me right now, but the pension plans that we acquired were actually better funded than the Ball legacy pension plans. So, in fact, in the UK, they have a very sizable pension there. It's actually over funded by a few hundred million dollars. And in the U.S., it's better funded than our plans have been. So we don't anticipate a major change in the pension expense going forward and most of the expense that we'll have will be really related to our U.S. legacy business versus what we acquired. But I can get you some more specific numbers. (54:23)
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: The fund status would be helpful too. Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.: Sure.
Operator: There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time.
John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.: Okay, great. Well, thank you, James, and we look forward to seeing you all at our upcoming investor conference in December. And if anyone who has not registered, we'd ask you to please reach out to Ann Scott and do so. And look forward to getting into 2017 and delivering on what we expect. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 4, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, Dmitra and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2016 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and in today's webcast slides. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business. In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance, given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical on the outlook over the next couple years from an earnings and cash flow perspective. In his comments, Scott will give you some visibility as to where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company, and I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respects to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term. The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results were operations-led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business while planning for the integration. As we had mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expected to gather earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. We have strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multiyear value-compounding period of growth on all key financial measures. Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans on our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico, beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production in our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our Food and Aerosol business, we grew our aerospace contracted backlog to over $1 billion, and we closed on the acquisition of Rexam while completing the required sale of the Divestment business. Now, that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews. Rest assured that our people executing our integration and value-capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments. So, Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work off of and some key financial metrics so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, John. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible, and we ask that the folks following our company align with our framework and financial metrics that we're able to provide at this time. I plan to bucket my comments in three areas, where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going. Let me start with where we have been. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums, and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest costs, a higher share count, and the tail end of startup costs related to recently completed projects. Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some of the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net startup costs in the quarter. Now that we've completed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup costs for the rest of the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single digits as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business due to competitive industry pricing in that country. Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter, and specialty volume continues to grow nicely with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half. European Beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow. Industry supply-demand remains tight and specialty demand remains strong. Food and Aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter due to strong global demand for aerosol containers and improved operational performance, offset by high single-digit food can volume declines due to timing of the Midwest pack related to our customer mix. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance. In summary, our Global Packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals, and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our Global Packaging people. Now, as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings; things like fees associated with the transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments, the special one-time tax payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. Make no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half of the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definitely potential in the comparable pro forma business. As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, let's start with the baseline. Using the U.S. pro formas filed in early July and today's reported first half performance, on a last 12 months basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually, and approximately $60 million of one-time inventory step-up. Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the UK change-of-control pension payment, and the cash payment to the Rexam shareholders. As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluded from comparable EPS would be roughly $60 million of inventory step-up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million, given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward. Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental costs of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations such as Millbank, Rexam's former global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016. As we referenced in the debt reconciliation included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by the change-of-control payment made to the UK pension plan at the closing of the transaction. For the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plan. And given the size of the remaining cash transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end. So now, where are we going? As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization. For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million. Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow, after $500 million of CapEx, is that we'll be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion, with approximately 70% under a cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. We are ramping up and staffing up for all of the new contracts, which will benefit second half and future years' performance. We're excited about the prospects of this business and, politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth assuming the government does not go into any prolonged continuing resolution. Now, across the company and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned, by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects, and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. While recognizing it is early days in the integration process, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate in excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. And as Scott said, we are also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to – in excess of $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 times to 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA range, we are poised to execute a more robust share repurchase program. In summary, our company has taken a step-change forward as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts, positioning the can as the most sustainable packaged in the beverage world, and/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously. And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path to growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each of the next several years. And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. Appreciate all the detail in the slide deck, so thanks for that.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): On the LTM EBITDA at the end of 2Q of $1.53 billion and a $1.8 billion midpoint for 2017, obviously synergies alone should be $150 million, based on your parameters. Can you, John, give us some of the other assumptions? Volume growth by region, and also the benefit from the growth initiatives, Monterrey and Myanmar, and also some of the growth that Rexam was also executing upon.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, you're absolutely right. When you look at what we have just said, there's year-over-year on a relative to the LTM, we expect $200 million to $300 million more of comparable operating earnings. $150 million of that is from the synergies we expect to realize and the balance of it comes from a variety of things. But let's not forget, over the last 18 months to two years, we have spent a fair amount of growth capital, whether it's building a new facility in Monterrey, the contour bottles, Myanmar, Lublin ends, India impact extruded, our new G3 technology devices, or other things, we expect to get the returns on that capital employed. And I think that makes up the back half of that.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So just to quantify on the volume side, what do you think the various regions would look like?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, let's take a step back and say where the various regions are. United States actually has had two quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say that as we – here in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume relatively flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter. Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, down a little bit. Ball's, again because of our customer mix, has done fairly well. But we're expecting the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit at the second half of this year after the Olympics are finished up, only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be a growth area. It's up a couple percent year-to-date and we expect that. And then when you look at Asia, you have to look at China and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining, in part because we're trying to rationalize our business and not make these cans for practice. Southeast Asia continues to grow mid to upper single digits. And then in some of the newer regions that we're getting our hands around, whether it's Middle East, whether it's even Russia – I think Russia is doing reasonably okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag. We can talk about what's going on in Turkey; we can talk about the challenges that Egypt is having with their currency; you can talk about some other places. But I think those fundamentals that I just laid out, we don't expect appreciable differences. But I do expect and we do expect as we go forward the can is going to continue to do well relative to other substrates.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Just one question for Scott on the projection of net debt of $6.3 billion by the end of 2017, basically a $700 million reduction versus 2Q. Can you bridge that for us? How much in combined cash restructuring are you estimating, and also working capital contribution? Thanks so much.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: At this point, there's not a huge amount of working capital. If you just bridge from the pro forma to that debt reduction next year, you'll have some element of working capital reduction; but really it's too early to call how much working capital. And then we just – $500 million for CapEx is a good marker at this point. But as we get further into this year and as we get probably to the January call, we'll give a lot more clarity as to what we think the cash flow will look like.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the only other thing, Ghansham, I would add is let's not forget also we pay a dividend. And so in that net debt range at the end of 2017, that also is included.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the 2019 free cash flow guidance, I know, Scott, you said it's a little early to know the exact timing of working capital gains. But should we assume there's working capital gains in that number, or should it largely be achieved in 2017 and 2018?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, I think if you look at what we've been able to do on our balance sheet, we've been able to get working capital out for a number of years in a row. And while it's way too early to talk about 2019, being an EVA company we focus on our balance sheet every day. And so that tends to lead itself to all kinds of opportunities, a lot of which we probably don't see at this point. But I think we have good alignment with the new folks that have joined our company, and it will be an ongoing process to get after that on a year-on-year basis for the next few years.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it; okay, thanks. And then the EPS guidance from 2017 to 2019, for EPS to double your long-term goal of the 10% to 15%, does that include any share repurchases in those numbers?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, as I said in my comments, once we get to 3 times to 3.5 times range, we will be dedicating our cash flow to a share repurchase program. So by definition in 2017, will we? It's unclear. It really depends on when we get to those targets. But the sooner we can get to that 3 time to 3.5 times range, the sooner we'll be buying back our stock.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. The final question, just with the special incentive plan and then the deposit program you laid out in the 8-K earlier in the week, could you just provide some detail, I guess, on number of people who are eligible? How deep it will extend into the organization; any details around that would be great.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, good questions. Two programs there. When I talked about we all have skin in the game, that's what I was referring to. There's a special incentive program that actually does go pretty deep in the organization, gets into the plant level. It's broad-based, distributed. The measurements are very similar to what we've done in the past; so that is tried and true. It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation, relative to our expectations and what our board signed up on the acquisition. And so it's a 3.5-year program and it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that. The second one is a deposit share program. It's a bit more limited for – we have done a number of these programs, a number – three or four of these over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock and then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time. In this case, I believe it's four years so long as they hold on to the existing stock. So you have to put your own money in, and then you'll be matched up to a certain point. And we think both of those have served us very well over the past 15 years, 20 years and it's just a reaffirmation that we're making sure that we, as people within Ball Corporation, are completely aligned with all of our shareholders.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right, great. Thanks again for all the details.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Regarding the $150 million synergies by the end of 2017, do you have any thoughts on which buckets might be driving those synergies in the next 12 months, 18 months in terms of procurement, G&A, best practices, versus which buckets may be a little bit more back-end weighted? And then in terms of big moving pieces with the synergies, you obviously identified the London headquarters closure. Are there other big projects we should think about or big components of the synergies?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me just preface it by – as Scott said, we're 35 days into our 90-day review. But what you're really getting at, kind of a timing issue. And I do think the G&A is more front-end loaded. You mentioned Millbank, which is a good example, which is not immaterial at all. From a sourcing perspective, there are certain things we can get after right away, there's some things that we have to wait for contracts to renew and so that's in process. But whether it's those, whether it's about being more disciplined from a commercial perspective, that's probably a longer-term, multiyear game plan. Managing our networks more efficiently, effective from a – where you make/where you ship perspective, that we can probably do that more short-term or around our overall fixed-cost leverage and some of that can be short term, some of it can be longer term. I really do think that we are going to be looking at a multiyear plan, as you all know. But I do think there is some low-hanging fruit upfront. What we aren't going to do is hire an army of accountants to manage what bucket is generating to the million dollars happening where. We're confident that we can reach in excess of $300 million by the end of 2019. And as we said, we're pretty confident that we can get at least $300 million during 2000s – or excuse me, $150 million during 2017.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. And then, John, just following up on one of your earlier comments. Rexam had invested in some regions like Middle East, Russia, India, where Ball had chosen not to. And now that you've been able to get a closer look at Rexam's assets, I guess you'd call them frontier markets, how would you characterize the return levels there? And are there areas or regions where further capacity adds makes sense, or alternately where maybe the returns met the Rexam threshold but not the Ball threshold and you might consider pruning capacity, as you have in China?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're still getting our hands around that as part of a 90-day program. In some of the things you have to look at the growth of the market, and then some of the things you have to look at is around risk, and whether it's political risk or economic risk or currency risk. And some of the areas that we've acquired that we hadn't been into are actually better than perhaps we thought. Some of them are not as good as we thought. So it is a mixed bag. As we get to October and into our January conference call, we'll have much more visibility and conviction around our point of view on those things. So, please just give us a little bit of time.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Congratulations – good morning. Congratulations on the results and closing the deal in the first quarter out. First question I had for you, John, is there anything that you can relay to us at this juncture about what you might have done differently in your plants that's an opportunity as you bring in the Rexam facilities and vice versa that in turn gives you comfort in the synergy target that you provided? The related question I had is on the corporate expense figure that you gave us for on a pro forma basis. Does that figure, do you think, once you bring on the U.K. headquarters folks and the services related to that, do you think that figure has opportunity to be lessened over time, to be reduced over time? And my last question and I'll turn it over, on capital spending of $500 million, is there some implied or are there some implied growth projects in that figure that you're not in a position to talk about? Or do you think that's a good number and growth would be additive to that? Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Let me jump on the first one, and then I'll let – have Scott weigh in. In terms of what we're seeing and how we might do things similar or different from the old Rexam, one of the things I'll point out is we are very excited about the engagement of the people that we acquired. I think this has reenergized everyone at our company, but also our new employees that are coming in. And anyone who runs businesses knows that if you have the engagement of the people that is a big chunk of it. So we're very, very excited. When you talk about the assets, you really have to go by region, and so I'll start in South America. They've got some great assets down there, they've got some great people down there and we're very excited about that. In Europe, they've recently been doing some restructuring in Europe, which is actually helping them there and I think the asset base there is very good. Obviously, we have to divest a majority of our old asset base. But I think on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable. In the United States, we think there is opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital in. But I'm talking about $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from an output perspective. And then in many of the other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do is with – a question was asked earlier. On a risk-adjusted return basis, would we have done some of the things that they had done? And it's – let's look forward, not back, and we're going to manage these things as best we possibly can. On the CapEx and then I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary, and Scott said the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is as we think about it, the CapEx really falls into three or four different buckets. Number one, we have a level of maintenance CapEx. We always talked about Ball's was $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million onto that for the totality of what we acquired. But then the additional capital is like we always do, and it's tried and true at Ball. It's a bottoms-up approach and it falls into three of our Drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, the existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America. It also talks about geographic growth where, as you know, we're just – in the last 12 months we've started up in Mexico and we've started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there; but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last but not least in terms of new customers and new products, our specialty continues to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much and so there's some probably opportunities along that path, but that's going to be customer and specific opportunity by opportunity. So that's a holistic context way to think about our capital, at least the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks, John; that's great.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, on the corporate costs, George, I mentioned $30 million incremental in the second half of the year, so this is kind of a $60 million run rate. We would expect to get a big chunk of that here as we – a lot of that has to do with Millbank that closes by the end of the year. But we've got to get through that 90-day review to have a better idea of what that corporate cost looks like on an ongoing basis as we get into 2017.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, Scott. I'll turn it over. Thank you very much.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, George.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, John, Scott, and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John or Scott, just one on the EBITDA target for 2017. And it sounds like you're expecting about $150 million of synergies from now to then, and there's underlying EBIT growth of about $200 million, it sounds like primarily coming from the recent growth projects. Can you just remind us how much you spent on those projects? So what kind of return on those projects this EBIT or EBITDA target implies.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Adam, one thing I'll point out. When we said there's a $200 million to $300 million of operating earnings growth year-over-year on a comparable basis, not – I think you said $350 million or something, so I just wanted to level-set you on that, of which $150 million will be coming from it. But if you go back and look at our CapEx over the last couple of years, we've probably spent around $300 million, $350 million plus or minus on some of these growth projects. And if you say that we're EVA-based company and you've got earn 9% after-tax, you can quickly do the math on that and see it's approaching $75 million or so. And then we also have continued efficiency gains and other things, the daily life that we do at Ball in terms of improving our business day-on-day.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, John. Just a couple of others. The 2019 free cash flow target, what EBITDA growth is implied from 2017 to 2019 in that target roughly?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we gave in – on that slide we gave what we believe to be comparable EBITDA 2000 – or actually I said in 2019, I said – you might have missed me – we're approximately $2 billion of comparable EBITDA.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: In 2019? Okay. And just one on Brazil. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? And to your knowledge is there additional capacity being added there at the moment?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, probably like you, it sounds like we've heard that there has been discussions about potential capacity additions in that area. Let's not forget this year the can market has been slightly down actually, but not appreciably; down a couple of percent maximum over it. But the can penetration still continues to go real strong. There has been a bit of a pause here. We'll have to wait and see what happens if there is new capacity put on. I don't want to speculate at all. But we're very much focused on maximizing the value of what we do down there. We've got a great team; we're very excited about the people there, their knowledge of the business, their knowledge of the industry, their knowledge of the customers, and their knowledge of the asset base.
Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, John. Best of luck.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, John; good morning, Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered, Scott, first of all, that free cash flow guidance for next year, just to be clear. You said that didn't assume any big shifts in working capital?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, there's still – there is some working capital. I would bucket it with a bunch of things working capital, what happens in deferred taxes, what happens in pension. To get to that number, there is other category beyond just operating earnings growth that you need to get, to get to that number.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, okay. I guess one of the questions people have had is just you guys have done a very effective job of factoring out a lot of your receivables; Rexam hadn't done that. So I'm just curious about how you are thinking about that and what the timeline on that might be.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, we're going to look at all the things that we've done over the last number of years, whether it's factoring supply chain finance, managing our inventories better, payable terms. Every lever that we have to pull from a working capital standpoint, we're going to re-look at all of those with the newly acquired business and apply those things. Some of them do take time to put in place and that's why I think there will be incremental benefits over a period of time, over a couple-year period. But everything's on the table. That review – that 90-day review that we talked about is getting into more detail on all of those things and figuring out okay, what are the opportunities? What are the timing of those opportunities? And then how do they sequence over the next few years?
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, John, I'm just curious. With the closing of the deal, has this led to any new, fresh conversations with customers and maybe even talking about different tenures in terms of relationships with some of the customers?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, absolutely. I mean as you know, we pride ourselves on being customer focused. I do think that the engagement with the customer base right now because there's a lot of change going on is quite active. And it varies by region, it varies by customer and it varies by segment. But rest assured, we are very much focused on being the best in terms of making the can the most sustainable package from an economic perspective, while at the same time being very disciplined from a commercial perspective, ensuring we get paid for our innovation, we get paid for our quality, we get paid for our service and so more to come on this, but rest assured, we're always actively engaged with our customers.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then just a final question. Any thoughts on further pipeline in the aerospace business in terms of bids that are out there?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. As we still have a number of won but not booked type of things out there. But what I was saying indirectly in my comments is we're entering the election season, and we are not anticipating many new wins to be booked just because of the ambiguity of the election cycle right now. I think the continuing resolution risk is still out there. And so realistically, it's difficult to assume any meaningful new wins during this election cycle. But we feel really good about the long-term prospects of that business.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for all the color and the commentary in the slide deck; it's very helpful.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I wanted to – kind of two points I wanted to hit on. One, Scott – and again I appreciate you're still working through the review and don't have everything exactly ticked and tacked yet. But when we think about the timing of the $280 million spend, clearly if you want to get after a good slug of those synergies flowing through next year, there's probably a good component of that coming this year. Would you maybe want to hazard a guess or help us a little bit with the timing of that? I'm guessing probably close to half goes out over the balance of this year. And would the bulk of the rest probably go out in 2017? How would we think about that?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I mean big chunks that I know will go out, so there's a big chunk of severance for folks that are leaving the organization. There was a chunk for compensation for people that were divested to Ardagh. I mentioned some of that pension funding. There's lots of fees and things that have to get paid. But the biggest chunk would be taxes that have to get paid on the gain, which we think is around $250 million. So those are the big chunks that will happen probably by the end of this year. Each quarter, we'll highlight the unusual or one-time, if you will, impacts of those.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, if I could drill into a couple areas within the can business, maybe if we could talk about Mexico for a second and then also talk about China. Within Mexico, it sounds like you have the second line up and running. I know you built that for three. Do you feel that – how are things going? As you sit today, do you feel that you'll be able to get a third line in there at some point over the next couple years? And then with respect to China, I know that's been a hotspot where you've had some problems. I think you spent a good bit of time talking about that last quarter. But I think you were going in, putting the full diagnostic suite to work of opportunities to take cost out. What perhaps can be the – you think can be the outcome in China?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, first with respect to Mexico, everything in Mexico is going quite well. The volume growth in Mexico that we're seeing, not only for the Mexican market but for the export out of Mexico, is going very, very well. Our customer is doing quite well and so we're excited about that. I'd rather not put specific timing on new capacity in Mexico, but rest assured the market continues to grow, and we think we've aligned ourselves with the right folks down there; so more to come on that. But nothing has changed from what we've talked about in prior conference calls around our long-term prospects about Mexico. With respect to China, probably the same holds true. We are executing very well on our cost-out program. As you recall, on the last call, I talked about in excess of $30 million of cost-out, and we are right on track with that. And I give our folks a tremendous amount of credit because without that, it would be a very, very challenging situation in China. The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean, because you can't save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in the China market. There's too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously because as you look through from a supply-demand perspective, there's too many suppliers chasing too few customers. And every time in the history of our company and the beverage can business when we see that, it speaks to consolidation. How that looks, when it looks, what it looks like, too early to tell.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Yes, hi. Good morning, John and Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: First question is just on the timing of the synergy capture. I just want to make sure I get this right. You're saying for the year 2017 you expect $150 million. And so I guess at the end of 2019, it would be in excess of $300 million. So I just want to clarify that. I guess that would suppose you would be somewhere – hoping to be in the higher $100 millions by the end of 2017 on a run rate basis?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. We said we would generate $150 million in 2017 – in excess of $150 million in 2017.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Got you. So that means you would end the year at a higher level, obviously.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I understand where you're going and I'd rather not go there because we're not going to be – as I said before, we're not going to be tracking all this. All I know is we have our own goals and aspirations and we're going to generate in excess of $150 million in 2017. And our goal is to generate in excess of $300 million by the end of 2019.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. And then just looking at the corporate expense, Scott, you mentioned that day one the incremental impact would be around $60 million, which I guess in rough numbers takes you to $130 million to $140 million. How much of that do you think can go away over the next year? And let's say, if you were to make a guess or bracket what 2018 corporate expense would look like, could it be down closer to $100 million by then? Would that be reasonable?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'm not giving a 2017 number yet. As I said, we have to go through the 90-day review. And you're right, that's a $60 million run rate. I think a lot of that will come out between now and the end of the year, and so the run rate will be lower than that. How much lower, it's too early to tell yet.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. And then the last question. John, you mentioned the start – or think, Scott, sorry – the start-up costs are largely behind you. And I guess my question is, I believe you guys have a project in the Czech Republic that starts up late this year. And I didn't know – maybe that's just too small to matter, if I have that right. And then you look at the CapEx for next year being about double that new maintenance level, I would suppose that – certainly not to the extent you saw this year in the first half, but should we expect some startup experience next year, given that CapEx number?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You raise a fair point. First and foremost, we are expanding our Czech Republic impact extruded business and it is expected to come on either later this year or early next year. It is – from the totality of Ball Corporation, I think the startup expense related to that would probably not be material. Within the Food and Aerosol segment, it could be. But I wouldn't get too concerned about that. And then as we go forward on it, the only reason that over the last 18 months we've talked about the startup expense is because we had such a compression and preponderance of these growth capital projects. I mentioned Monterrey, contour bottle, G3, Lublin ends, India, devices, it all was happening at once and so we felt we needed to point that out. As we go forward, if that were to happen again, which I'm not saying it will but if that were to happen again, we would be as transparent as we can. But I wouldn't get too worried about startup expenses as you look forward.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Real quickly, 28%, is that your best guess of a long-term tax rate?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, for right now that's a good thing to use.
Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. The free cash flow guidance for 2017, does that figure include any of the cash cost to realize the synergies and the line conversions as it relates to Ardagh?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, what we're going to do as we get into next year, we'll highlight any cash costs related to getting after synergies. We'll break things out so that you can decipher exactly what our run rate free cash flow would be versus our one-time cost to get after some of those synergies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: But just to be clear, it does not – yes, I'm sorry.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Just to give you a sense of it, if we're talking about severance, for example, cash flow severance, we'll point that out, because that's more one-time in nature. If we're looking at converting a standard line to a specialty line, that's more operating from our perspective. And so, as Scott said, as we go forward, we will lay that out with as much transparency as we're able.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Phil, in your question, you said something related to Ardagh. I didn't quite – how does that...
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Yes, I thought there was some part of the divestiture process, you had to agree on converting some lines; I think steel aluminum in Germany. Is that in the CapEx guidance for 2017? And I just want to make sure. So the free cash flow guide for 2017 does strip out potentially some of these more one-off in nature, like cash items such as severance, right? Is that how we should be thinking about it?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And with respect to the other things, let's just assume it's behind us, not in front of us.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, okay. And then are there any big slugs of contracts up for renewal over the next few years and change-of-control dynamics that we should be mindful of?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: As we go by region by region, certainly not over the next 12 months or so. We always have contracts coming up for renewal, but there are some in different regions that over the next few years will be coming up. But from an overall perspective I think the vast majority of our business is under long-term contract.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Any change-of-control issues were dealt with prior to closing.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's great. And just one last one for me. North America on the bev can side, growth has been pretty stable. Are you seeing any mix shift on the CSD side from PET into cans? Just because it's leveled off quite a bit Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it has leveled off a little bit. I do think that when you really look at CSD, we have to think about fountain versus PET versus cans. Fountain has been actually the one most hit by the declines more recently. PET has been doing a little bit better than cans. But cans has been holding their own, to your point. The thing that still continues to go very well is on the craft beer side. In our business alone, it's up year-to-date 30%. And as – you, as a consumer, you go out there and you can see cans continuing to take a greater share of the package mix in the craft industry. And then, last but not least, the overall beer category is up. The overall category itself is up almost 2%, just under 2%; and can volume is up over 4%. So we continue to take share from glass even in some of the more mainstream brands as well.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And soft drink specialties, specialty sizes is doing reasonably well too. So...
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, obviously, this deal makes you a much bigger beverage company. But I know that I think a lot of people are expecting your Food and Aerosol business to improve looking into 2017. But can you talk about how you feel about the Food and Aerosol business and how it fits into your portfolio right now, and the capital you think you are going to need to spend in that business going forward? And then lastly, just a volume trajectory here. As we think about there being – the idea that there is excess capacity in North America right now, specifically on the food can side.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, as I mentioned I think on the last conference call, it's a food and an aerosol business. And those are different end markets. The aerosol business in that is actually bigger than the food business, and that's important to note. And we continue to see good growth, whether it's on the tinplate side here in North America or down in South America where it exists, or on the impact extruded side where we're here in North America and also over in Europe. We continue to see very good supply dynamics – supply-demand dynamics; we continue to see good growth; we continue to see good economic opportunities for investment on that side. On the food side, that's where the challenge has been and it's no secret that there has been overcapacity in there. We've taken our lumps over the last couple years in that business. Some of it was market-related from a pricing perspective and some of it was self-inflicted related to the cost side. We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive. And that's where I think, Debbie, because of the growth in the aerosol and because of the cost-out we have in food, that's why we, as well as many other people, do expect a better 2017 relative to 2016. I think longer term, I've just laid out really what the strategies of those two different segments is. It's continued to grow with the aerosol and continued to be the supplier of choice for our big, multinational customers on the aerosol side. And then on the food can side, service our existing customers as well as possible and recognize that's a cash business.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. If I could just move to the Americas segment, I think you saw 10% growth in specialty in the quarter. Could you talk about specifically what's driving that, how sustainable it is, and how you think about that when you put the two businesses together with Ball and Rexam?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, gosh. It comes from a variety of things. Our bottle strategy and bottle technology continues to go well. Scott mentioned on the CSD side some of the smaller sizes continue to go well. Some of the larger sizes on the beer category continue to go well. Energy drinks, sleek cans. It really – there's not just one area; I think it's across the board. And I do think part of our strategy has been as the 12-ounce declines, either through absolute declines or through cannibalization, we want to grab that cannibalization by having specialty cans. And that's – there's a good chunk of the loss of 12-ounce being captured by specialty cans and that's why we've been focused on it.
Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. I'll pass it over.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. On the subject of the market dynamics post the Rexam deal, have you seen any change, perceptible change, in the level of competitive activity post-deal? Has it been fairly status quo within your various regions? I know that's a very broad question, but figured I would throw that out there nonetheless.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it is a very broad question. And remember, we're 30 days, 35 days into this, George, and this is a time of year where you're really not having discussions around price with our customers. And so, quite candidly, we've been very much focused on getting our folks aligned over what our strategic objectives are.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, fair enough. Now, next question I had, more in terms of the portfolio and strategy. You talked earlier about China and the parallels with other case studies in your time at the company and in Ball's development. If an appropriate consolidation opportunity arose in the next couple of years, do you think you could manage that while also integrating Rexam? Do you have enough depth to manage that? And the related – well, let me stop there and then I had one more question.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, let me remind you that our folks in Asia have been doing a wonderful job in terms of the cost-out programs and managing a challenging situation. But they haven't really been affected at all by the Rexam transaction. They have not been involved in the integration just because Rexam had no presence over there. And so as we look – your question is about bandwidth. We're quite cognizant from a corporate perspective of the bandwidth issues, but from a management people on the ground issues over there, we've got a very good team. The biggest question from my – our perspective, George, on that is, is one consolidation enough to really change the dynamics? And you've heard us be pretty consistent that we're not going to be investing in China to become the biggest. If there is an opportunity to make us better and meaningfully better as part of that, then we'll evaluate it. But that's the criteria by which we will look at it.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Understood. The last question I had – and again recognizing this is not the steak in the middle of the plate; it's more the vegetables or maybe the dinner roll. Again, in Food and Household, that's been a business that's been struggling. It's – again, as you mentioned I think to Debbie's question, two separate markets, two separate sets of dynamics. Does there come a point where the food business recognizing that you have every intention of improving the performance next year gets so challenged that it begins to impair your ability to compete in aerosol? Said differently, again using what you said about China, does there come a point – is there an opportunity, perhaps, where combining businesses might make sense in the food market? And I'll leave it there. And thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks, George. We've talked about this in prior quarters. Recall, though, that from a manufacturing footprint perspective, we make tinplate food cans in the same facilities as we make aerosol tinplate. And so when you talk about separating it out, it does become more challenging. But on the flip side of that, that provides the leverage of that. And so if the food can business continued to decline, we would be taking out a line here, a line there in existing plant. But I don't think you can necessarily separate those two. But having said that, we don't believe nor do we see exactly what you're talking about. And that's why I said you've got to understand who you are. And that part of the business, it's a cash business, so treat it as such.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Fair enough. Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, George.
Operator: There are no further questions registered at this time.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, great. Well, thank you, Dmitra, for your help and we look forward to talking to everyone on our third quarter conference call, which is at the end of October – excuse me. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 28, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2016 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam, and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 and other public releases; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction, including the proposed sale of the Divestment business. Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on our quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference calls are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decision in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction, except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme document, which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, please visit the offer for Rexam page on ball.com. Now joining me today on the call is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2016. It's been an incredibly busy start to the year. Our first quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds from a very competitive pricing environment in China, and tough first quarter comparisons in our Food and Household segment, as well as start-up costs from our various capital projects, all that we'd mentioned on our January conference call, played out. Overall we are pleased with the performance of our businesses, given those headwinds, during a seasonally weak quarter, and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter in just a moment. I'll say, however, that other than China, most of these headwinds are behind us, and we feel momentum building in our various businesses. Since late January, we have made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including: signing the agreement for the required sale of the Divestment business; producing cans and ends at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility; the successful groundbreaking of our aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czechia, which is expected to come online in early 2017; adding additional customers at our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India; gaining efficiencies in our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas; and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and growing our aerospace contracted backlog, as well as acquiring Wavefront Technologies to further enhance our data and cyber capabilities. We continue to navigate the highly complex process around the proposed offer for Rexam, while keeping our team focused on things they can control day-to-day to keep our company strong and well positioned for future growth. I again want to thank everyone at Ball for rising to the challenge over the past 15 months, and we feel good about the direction of our company, save for the pricing environment in China, with many of the transitory headwind issues now behind us. Our future is bright, and irrespective of the Rexam transaction, we see meaningful year-over-year improvement through the balance of the year and beyond. We are right on track and the best is ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott, for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2016 were $0.59 versus last year's $0.69. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of $7 million in start-up costs, related to our sizable Monterrey project and the new tinplate steel project, as well as anticipated lower volumes in our North American Food business and competitive pricing in China. The first quarter played out exactly as we said in January, with the re-pricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our Food and Household Products business, and the close-out of start-up costs on various capital projects resulting in the first quarter being soft. Our GAAP results for the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange-rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam, and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with the anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid, with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.4 times, and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3 times, including the non-current restricted cash sitting in escrow for the U.S. and euro bond placements – from the U.S. and euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity on hand to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2016 were down year-over-year solely due to China pricing, a significant swing in China volume, and project start-up costs related to Monterrey. Absent the start-up costs in Q1 in North America, this region was up year-over-year. As we move through the year the cost-out programs in China will reduce the loss in this region, and despite the China headwinds, we will see year-over-year improvement across the segment in the back half of the year, as our Monterrey, Mexico, can plant second line comes online and start-up costs moderate, more than offsetting the impact of China pricing. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 2%, including mid-single-digit volume growth in North America, low-single-digit volume growth in Brazil, and China volumes being down upper-single-digits as we proactively prune business due to competitive pricing. European Beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds and strong manufacturing performance offsetting slightly – offset slightly by volumes being down low-single-digits due exclusively to soft export sales to Africa. In fact, excluding such export sales, volumes in the E.U. were up low-single-digits, in-line with the overall market. Industry demand for specialty cans across Europe continues to grow, and industry supply/demand remains balanced. Food and Household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter due to mid-single-digit food can volume declines following the prior-year benefit of certain volumes related to a past food can customer, inventory holding losses, as well as start-up costs related to our tinplate steel aerosol project in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. We continue executing a disciplined cost control growth equation in this segment, with cost-out initiatives like the announced closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility versus incremental investments to support continued metal aerosol growth and production efficiencies initiatives in Mexico, Europe and India. These decisions will drive future quarter-on-quarter improvement for 2016 and beyond. In summary, our Global Packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects, as we get closer to being able to initiate the next exciting stage in our Global Metal Beverage business. To employees listening on today's call, thank you for all the work on all of these projects. Our business is embarking on its next transformation, which is really exciting stuff, and the collective efforts of the entire team are critical to our shared success. Now as we look to the remainder of 2016 and reflecting Ball as a standalone company today, here's a snapshot of some key metrics; no real changes here. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs, and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 25%. Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. And we expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process. Exactly as we said in January in 2016, we expect all our businesses to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China Beverage Can, with momentum accelerating as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. As we indicated back in January and as we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we plan to focus our comments in terms of cash EPS post close, due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported first quarter results that were relatively flat with last year; however, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter $100 million higher than year-end, and even happier to report that as of this week, our Aerospace backlog stands at greater than $900 million with even more opportunities for growth during the remainder of 2016. It's taken a fair amount of patience for us to get to this point, and I want to congratulate the entire Aerospace team for their hard work. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us in Aerospace, ramping up on all the new contracts and integrating the recent acquisition of Wavefront Technologies. Now across the company and as we look forward, we are nearing the end of the marathon we began back in February, 2015, and we cannot wait to step up to the starting line for the sprint to achieving synergies, cash flow growth and the higher EVA dollar generation that all of our investments can provide. As we said, we continue to face headwinds in our China business, although going forward it will moderate. We expect all of our other business units to be up year-over-year and feel momentum building in our business. Together we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond. And we look forward to the hard work that lies ahead. So with that, Lynn, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the commentary. I guess the first question I had, just from a detail standpoint; I'd missed some of the volume statistics you had relayed regarding beverages. Could you – beverage cans. Could you quickly go through that? And then, to the extent that you can comment, what effect did you see from weaker beer production in Brazil as it relates to your volumes? And then, a couple follow-ons.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. George, this is John. I think what Scott had said in his prepared remarks, North America was up mid-single-digits, Brazil was up low-single-digits, Europe was down a little bit but that was exclusively because of exports into Africa slowing down. The Continental Europe was actually up low-single-digits, about a point, point-and-a-half, in-line with the overall market. And then China was down upper-single-digits as we proved – as we pruned some of that very low margin or no margin business. From a beer perspective in Brazil, you're right, there was some – there one of the customers did have an issue in one of the facilities. It was a little bit soft, but in our portfolio, our customers, as I said, we were up a couple percent.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for that primer there, John. Good morning to you. I guess the other question I had, this isn't the first time that China has been a topic not necessarily for the right reasons on one of your earnings calls, and certainly you have company, so you're not the only participant that's had some challenges there. Are you getting to a point where you need to – recognizing you've been already limiting capital, are you getting to a point where you maybe need to consider other strategic options or strategies in China to improve the performance? And if so, can you provide a bit more color there? And then last one and I'll turn it over, obviously a lot has changed in the tinplate market over the years, but closing Weirton, how will you manage all the metal decorating and processing that you need for your tinplate business around the rest of the country? Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, George. Let me talk a bit about China. China is a sore, and there's no hiding from that. It's getting inordinate attention at our company right now. What I'd describe is operationally, we continue to drive a hell of a lot of costs out of the business, in the range of $30-plus million this year alone. The pricing environment is just quite, quite challenging. The only thing I can really say beyond that is strategically we're assessing and continue to assess how to make this a better business. As you all know, we're not in the business to lose EVA dollars, and so it's a very high focus for us. On the tinplate side, there has been a lot of change in that business. I think the Weirton, West Virginia closure, while unfortunate, allows us to spread a lot of that cutting and coating capability into other facilities, and that's exactly what we're doing. So it's a capacity rationalization play at the end of the day, getting closer to our customers.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. It is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good. Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. It looks like InBev is adding some additional specialty can capacity via their metal container subsidiary. We've seen some other customers do that as well. Are these one-offs or is it basically the customer not being happy with how fast the industry is adding capacity in North America? What are your thoughts on that?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think what I'd say is Anheuser-Busch InBev have been in the can business for 25, 30 years now. And they have a asset base that they continue to look, we're aware obviously that they're putting bottles in. They're the only one making bottles for themselves. As you know, we actually have a large and very growing bottle portfolio in ours. And so I'm not – I think these are more one-offs than systematic. And that's how we're viewing it. They're looking at making their own needs for their own capacity.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And how much did you spend on start-up costs in 1Q? And how much are you expecting in 2016? And also, can you just remind us how much you spent in 2015? Just trying to see what the delta is year-over-year?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: In the first quarter, the start-up costs were around $7 million. I think last year they were a little over $20 million. For the remainder of the year, they should start to moderate; we'll still have a little bit of start-up in the second quarter as we get our second line at Monterrey ramping up. But then as we get to the second half of the year it'll moderate quite a bit.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Just one last one, acquisition related, if I can. What kind of tax leakage are you expecting from the divested asset startup?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We're still in the planning phases on all that, so it's really not appropriate to comment at this point. But there's a number of things, they have some NOLs that we'll take over that will dampen the tax leakage, but right now we're not prepared to give you any specifics.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yup. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just of the decline in Americas and Asia, could you break out a little bit what was China? And were the – of the $7 million of start-up costs, was that all from Monterrey? And was that all in the segment or was there also, I think, some in steel aerosol?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. The $7 million in that segment is Monterrey. There was also a couple million on the Food side. But – and all the rest of that is really China. The pricing swing from year-over-year, re-pricing inventories as you come to the first quarter, so you take kind of a double hit. And that's why as we move through the year the loss will moderate and the cost-out actions start to take hold, and so you'll add – it'll have less of an impact as we move through the year. And then with the investments that we're making that come online here as we move through the year, those will more than offset the China pricing at the second half of the year.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The investments in Monterrey and other.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I'm sorry. Correct.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then, Scott, did you say, I guess, starting in the third quarter, profits in this segment would be up year-over-year, both in 3Q and 4Q?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. That's correct.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then is that – I mean do you think, I don't know, the second quarter, but could profits for the segment be up for the entire year, do you think?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we have to wait and see how volumes shake out. I think it'll be – there's probably still a little bit of a drag just because again some start-up costs in Monterrey will still continue in the second quarter. It gets closer but then the back half of the year looks meaningfully better.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. And just a final question, Brazil for the remainder of the year, just given your mix and the conditions down there. Any thoughts on what volumes could look like for the year?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We're starting to go into their seasonally slow period of time and so we, as we said in the beginning of the year, we expected modest growth not necessarily from overall volume but from share mix relative to glass, and we're still seeing that happen. As we enter the seasonally slow, I do think we're going to get a very modest uplift because of the Olympics. Remember, that's just in Rio, but Rio is a very densely populated area, so I don't think our views of 2016 have changed materially at all from when we were on the call in January.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, there. John, with everything going on, I think I want to ask you a question about Aerospace. You said, I know on the last call, that I think the backlog was like literally – it looks like it's grown 50%. It was, what, $617 million. Now it's over $900 million. And I know you gave us some sign that you thought – some mention of like $800 million in near-signed business, and so the question is, have things really kicked in a little bit stronger than you would have expected three months ago or six months ago for that business in terms of the backlog? And maybe you could comment a little bit on the quality of the backlog, what proportion is fixed price versus cost plus?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So your first question, has anything changed relative to our expectations? The short answer is, no. You know you always have timing issues of when you get signed because some of it's out of our control when you have to have various government agencies go through their approval processes. We've had some in the first quarter, some in April, as you heard. And even as we expect going into the June/July, whether it's June, whether it's July I can't tell you right now, but I know that we still have a fair amount of projects that we call won, not booked, which is not in our backlog but we won it, it's just we have to go through the signatory process and the funding process with the government. So nothing has changed on that front. From a mix perspective, I think I talked about this on the January call, there's not an appreciable difference in the mix relative to fixed price versus cost plus. There could be a little bit more of cost plus in the overall scheme of this new business won, only because a lot of it's new technology, which I think is good. And our folks have been executing very well on those types of things. So a lot of it's in the DoD, which is both from a satellite perspective, as well as a sensor perspective, and then also in the NASA side, where we haven't done a tremendous amount with NASA because their budget's been so constrained, but we've been able to do a very good job or weave our way back into that and are doing several neat things for NASA as we go forward there.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one, a follow-up is on – I mean look at the guidance items that Scott gave us, whether it is EBITDA, et cetera, there is no change from the last call, and you did mention that things progressed as you thought they would in the first quarter, but maybe a little weaker than what the consensus was looking for. And I guess the question is, does your full-year outlook on the – is there any reason the EPS – and again, this is a little bit of hopefully a fiction question because of the change that'll take there in June, take place there in June, but leaving that aside, would your earnings per share view have changed since January? In other words, would there maybe have been a small shift out of the first quarter into the back nine months of the year?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'll take this and maybe, Scott can chime in. Nothing has changed relative to our expectations. We had said in the January that we expected the first quarter to be soft, given China re-pricing, given the year-over-year comps in Food and Household Products, and then the start-up in the first quarter that, as Scott mentioned a minute ago, would begin to wane as we get into the second quarter and certainly the second half of the year. So nothing has changed from that perspective. I will say this: it is a bit challenging for us. And I have said this for a year now in our opening comments that given the U.K. Takeover Code, we have certain restrictions on what we can say in terms of profit forecasts. And that does create some challenges for us to be able to articulate and communicate in a way that we normally would do so. So – but to answer your question directly and to reiterate it, nothing has changed from our perspective.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Glad you were able to reiterate your synergies, but where were some of the upside coming from since the amount of assets being divested is a little larger than I expected? Also, can you talk about some of the working capital savings potential? If we look at the key working capital metric for Rexam versus Ball, there seems to be a pretty sizable opportunity. Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, the synergies, they're really the same buckets we've been talking about all along. There's four different buckets: G&A, manufacturing, sourcing and kind of best practices. So those haven't really changed; the buckets haven't really changed either. There's always a little bit of puts and takes but essentially it's the same as we thought 15 months ago when we first started talking about it.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: On the second part of that question...
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Capital.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Oh, yeah. The working capital. Yeah, that's obviously one of the areas that we expect to get after right after close. We manage our balance sheet every day of the year. And so that's one area in which we think there can be a meaningful amount of cash taken out over the course of some period of time, probably a year or two.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, but you wouldn't expect anything structural with the Rexam assets where you wouldn't be able to flex the working capital initiatives you have, legacy Ball, right?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, again I think we have to stand by what Scott said given the Takeover Code rules.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay, got you. And I guess another question for Scott, how are you guys thinking about leverage longer term? Is there like a threshold you want to keep in terms of 3 times, 2.5 times, going forward post this deal? And how should we think about your ability to buy back stock from a timing standpoint?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I think we're going to lever up here at the close. And it's also kind of the peak of our working capital borrowing season, so it'll be a little bit higher. The game plan is to drive that down closer to three times before we start buying back stock, but because of the asset sale was a little bit larger than what was probably initially thought about, we'll probably get to that leverage – that leverage area a little bit quicker where we can start buying back stock faster. Longer term, once we get through all of this and get those synergies, then we look at our capital structure. And we'll think about where we want to be longer term.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very helpful, guys.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is it possible, Scott, to get any sense of just how much the aluminum premiums helped Europe in the first quarter? Those guys really gave you a nice going-away present.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. It was a little more than €10 million in the first quarter.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. And then, John, you said really nothing had changed since January, but has the situation in China actually been even worse than you might have expected or weaker than you might have expected?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, yeah, I said – what I said is from a financial point of view what our expectations are relative to what's developing (27:59), nothing has changed. The one other thing in China that has – that was a headwind that we haven't really expressed explicitly was the volumes being softer. Some of that was that we consciously made a decision that we're not making cans for practice. The overall China market has slowed down a little bit. It's still growing, don't get me wrong. But I think those two things create environment where our volumes were down, and that was a headwind in addition.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. The last thing I had, I know you have – the main focus for you is these start-ups and then the integration of Rexam over the next couple of years, but if you looked a little further down the road, what are the most interesting opportunities if you look two, three, four years down the road in terms of opportunities to create value at Ball?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You know what? Let – if I could ask you please, let's park that until after we close the transaction and then we will make sure that we are going to be very, very much communicative in what we see in terms of the next one, three, five years, both operationally and strategically.
Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sounds good. Good luck.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, everyone. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Two questions again, recognizing it is not your largest segment in Food and Household. Can you comment at all as to whether there's been any adjustment in pricing this year related to things like meat com clauses and that sort of thing or has pricing been relatively stable? Or if it's not, has it been purely just pass-through of metal? Then I had a follow-on. Again, to the extent that you can comment.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. As you know, we run on a pass-through model, and that's really the only thing that's been going on. The pricing environment's been relatively stable.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for that, John. And then, the last question I have, and back to Weirton conceptually, in the past when we've seen companies adjust their metal decorating footprint, it's a tricky practice and there have been times where capacity have been moved from one facility to another and the initial stages don't go as smoothly as expected. What are you doing now, given, again, all the irons that you have in the fire, in managing the metal decorating process such that when it does come up, the coating, the printing, not that there's a lot of printing done on the food side anymore, but comes up to spec? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, George. You raise a good point. What I will point out is over the last 18 to 24 months we have not been performing well in that part of the business. So as – in Weirton. And so as a result we've already had to move some things into other facilities. And so that's – I think most of that's behind us. There's always a level of complexity that when you're taking a facility out and having to redistribute volumes, but a lot of that's already been happening because of the performance in Weirton.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thank you, John. I'll turn it over. Good luck in the quarter.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple questions for you. One, if you could, I hate to keep coming back to the China and the other piece, but if I maybe try to approach it from the perspective of your segment was down, I think, $23 million year-over-year, if you could give us buckets and maybe size them. Is that a quarter, one-third of that currency? I think you said startups were about $7 million, so I'm guessing that's about one-third of it. Was China the other bucket or how, Scott, would you want us to think about that?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. No, you have it exactly right. China was the other part of that, both from a pricing standpoint and a volume standpoint. And I mentioned earlier as you had to lower prices, you had to lower the value of the inventory, so that's why you took a little bit bigger hit in the first quarter than what you'll see as we move through the year. And then the cost-out actions will start, we'll continue to gain momentum as we get into the back half of the year. And so for that segment in total, the back half of the year looks better.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, but is it about one-third of the delta? Does that sizing sound right or am I thinking about it incorrectly?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. No. Yeah, your sizing was right. It was roughly $7 million in start-up costs...
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. I thought I – the reason I'm thinking about it is I thought I heard you mentioned earlier, too, that you had about $30 million of costs you have been taking out in China, and that just sounded like a really, really big number.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It is a big number. That's a full year number. That wasn't for the first quarter, that was for the full year. But as I said, the unfortunate thing is that we've been making a lot of great progress in our North American business and in our South American, Brazilian business. And it's being masked by China. That is why I said that operationally we are driving the hell out of the costs there because we've got to get our costs as low as possible; but then strategically we have to assess how we make this a better business.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, so the $30 million of costs-out is a reference for the whole segment?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: For the whole year for China.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: For the whole year, for China. Okay. That's incredibly impressive.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Our folks are doing a heck of a job. It's just disappointing that the pricing environment is so bad.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, no, that's very impressive for the size of the business. If I could switch gears a second and talk a little bit about Mexico, I know you've got a number of customers tied to the plant and the multi-lines you're sticking in there. But one of the – probably the biggest one in the region I think you're tied to is experiencing some delays, we have read, in bringing the brewery up online. How does that or does that change anything with respect to what you're doing in bringing capacity on stream? Do you still provide the cans regardless of who is brewing the beer or how does that process work?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. No. Let's put this in context. They're not experiencing delays; they're growing so fast that they can't keep up with their demand. That's what's happening. And so as they build out their existing facility and they've announced a new facility, we are supplying them a significant amount. I forget their growth rates, not only as beer, which is very strong, it's the fastest-growing beer company I think in the world right now, but then they are underweighted to cans. And so there's a double benefit for us. And so our business is going as fast as they can take them.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So perhaps, I know you have got one line in now. I think you're starting a second. I think you may have sized it for three. Is there a reasonable opportunity to build that the whole way out in the next 12, 18 months?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We believe there is. And we'll talk more about that when we can.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. That's the last of my questions. Thanks, gentlemen.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Chris.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Hayes, it appears at this time that there are no further questions on the phone lines.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Well, thank you. Thank you all for listening in. And as we've said, we look forward to speaking to you later on this summer in a much more earnest conversation.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 28, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John Hayes: Great. Thank you, Tia, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's fourth quarter full year 2015 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the Company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as Company news releases. Now, if you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to, number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release. Number two, where we are in the regulatory process. Number three, an update on ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction. Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary as well as our future outlook, and certain other items we would normally discuss on an earnings conference call, due to the nature of the proposed transaction and restrictions under the U.K. Takeover Code. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decision in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction, where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, please visit the Offer for Rexam page on ball.com. Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I will provide a brief overview of our Company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I will finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2016. Our fourth quarter volumes, free cash flow and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds we acknowledged throughout 2015 and around earnings translation, project startup costs and tough volume comps in our North American food continued, while others like aluminum premium became a tailwind and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. Overall, however, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter and full year in just a moment. Since we spoke last October, we have made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including, successfully beginning the production of beverage can ends in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which is also slated for additional end modules in 2016. The successful startup of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility, which is serving multiple foreign brewers importing their product into the U.S. The successful startup of a new aluminum impact extruded line in Devizes, U.K. as well as our recently announced aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017. The successful startup of our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, various investments to further the growth of our specialty can and new product portfolio, including our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas and our new tin plate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, and the continued construction of our new beverage can plant in Myanmar now slated to open in April 2016. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Brazilian joint venture and received conditional regulatory approvals for our proposed offer for Rexam from the European Commission and Brazilian CADE. Discussions are ongoing with the FTC. We have weathered a very busy 2015, in terms of managing the headwinds, investing in our future and making progress with our Rexam acquisition. Everyone at our Company has been extremely busy and I want to thank everyone at Ball who has persevered and risen to the challenge. Thanks. With that, I will turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. For the full year 2015 comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year comparable diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net $0.04 and $0.49, respectively, related to foreign currency effects, startup costs and other one-time items. As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the fourth quarter, $0.06 of unfavorable currency translation effects largely due to a weaker euro, $0.02 of startup costs associated with capital projects and an aluminum premium tailwind of $0.04. [ph] free cash flow came in at $558 million after $528 million of CapEx and excluding roughly $80 million of cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction. Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of the proposed transaction. These economic hedges allow us to lock in transactions purchase price economics, though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. Credit quality and liquidity of the Company remains very solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 5.6 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5 times, including the non-current restricted cash sitting in escrow from the December U.S. and euro bond placements. The Company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at year end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the Company. For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the fourth quarter and full year, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2015 were down slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing in China, slightly lower performance in Brazil and project start-up costs in North America. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 5% and just up over 1% for the full year 2015. Our Monterrey, Mexico can plant just began producing cans and ends earlier this month. Our second can line will come up mid-year in China. While volumes remain relatively healthy, the overall pricing environment remains extremely challenging and our aggressive cost out programs have not been able to keep up with the price erosion and we expect to be down in profitability again in 2016 in this region. European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter, due to aluminum premium tailwinds of €6 million as well as improved plant utilization for the full year. Comparable earnings were down approximately $20 million to unfavorable foreign earnings translation. On a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Low single-digit volume growth and low double-digit specialty can growth continue to reflect the ongoing value-added benefits of the can with European consumers. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter as segment volumes declined following the customer shift in U.S. food cans as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were down slightly in the fourth quarter due to the earlier conclusion of the pack late in the third quarter, but up for the full year. For the fourth quarter and full year, the segment was also impacted by unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business and start-up costs related to numerous capital projects across the segment. Our next-generation lightweight steel aerosol can manufacturing technology is now commercially available on shelves and further growth in our global extruded aluminum businesses, as well as significantly better operating performance in our tinplate businesses will provide good opportunity to improve segment performance in 2016. In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for all the great work during what has been one of the busiest times in our Company's 136-year history. Now, as we look to 2016 reflecting Ball as a standalone Company today, here is a snapshot of some key financial metrics. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 25%. Corporate undistributed is expected to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. Also, recall that due to the acquisition of our JV's partner's interest in Brazil, our outstanding shares at the beginning of this year are higher by 5.7 million shares and we will no longer have any effects from this business in our non-controlling interest line on the income statement. We expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process. In 2016, we expect all of our segments to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can business. While we expect the first quarter to be relatively soft, due to the re-pricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the closeout of startup expenses on our various capital projects, momentum will accelerate as we move through the year. One final heads-up before I turn it over to John. As we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we currently plan to incorporate into our future comments a focus on cash earnings per share, due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. With that, I will turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported a solid quarter given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog held steady ending the quarter at $617 million. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us. Over the past few months, our aerospace business has won a variety of classified and non-classified programs that are worth over $800 million that have not yet been booked into our backlog as the contracts need to be signed and in several cases the funding needs to be approved by the U.S. government. In addition, we still have a number of additional proposals submitted for award that collectively measure in the billions. A terrific job done by our folks and we continue to be amazed by the creativity, agility and patients that they have shown. The near-term goals for the aerospace team are to finish strong on existing programs and ramp successfully on the new work throughout the second half of 2016. Now turning to the future, we continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam and we look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 through improved performance as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide. While our biggest challenge is to weather the unsustainable pricing environment in our China beverage can business, overall, we feel good about where we are. Our objectives are consistent with last year. Successfully execute our capital projects, generate strong free cash flow, grow our specialty businesses, focus on cost optimization and manufacturing performance and cross the finish line on the proposed offer for Rexam. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to a successful year ahead. With that, Tia, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: Since you last reported, one of your competitors announced that they are adding their first new metal beverage can plant in the U.S. since 1993. How do you view this announcement for the industry first off and does this impact your strategy in any way as it relates to how optimized your production footprint is between standard and specialty cans in the U.S.?
John Hayes: Obviously, we are aware of that, Ghansham, and I cannot comment of the thought process around that. I can tell you that specialty cans continue to grow strongly and that they are probably just trying to keep up with their own demand. I can tell you from our perspective that our system is in good shape. We continue to grow specialty containers off a relatively high base already and we are trying to manage the 12-ounce capacity, and what I mean by that is, for example, in the last quarter or so we have actually converted a line from 12 ounce into specialty containers and we have been just following that strategy we have been embarking on for a number of years now.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Just I guess my second question related to Rexam, understanding the sensitivity around that, but just given the specific divestiture concessions for both, Europe and Brazil that you have announced, how should we think about the buckets of synergies that you outlined at the outset of the deal? I think you had previously outlined 44% G&A, 22% freight, et cetera. Should we expect a different weighting going forward based on what you know now?
Scott Morrison: This is Scott. I would not change the buckets too much. You know, all that stuff will move around once you get to closing we will be able to give you a lot more clarity about that, but for right now we are not updating what those changes might be.
John Hayes: Yes. Ghansham, this is John. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, due to U.K. Takeover Code and some of the rules and restrictions around it, we are just not in a position to comment any further than we have.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
John Hayes: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Wilde: Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
Mark Wilde: John, I wondered, can you provide just any kind of update on the process with the regulators in the U.S.?
John Hayes: Nothing other than saying that we are in discussions and that we have said in our earnings release we expect to close the transaction in the first half. Most likely it is probably going to be in the second quarter of 2016. That is what we expect as we sit here today.
Mark Wilde: Okay. All right, just as a follow on, is it possible to get any color on bev can volumes and mix over in Europe in the fourth quarter and what you are expecting in '16?
John Hayes: Yes. Well, I am happy to go through that. Remember, fourth quarter is a seasonally slow quarter, so I will start with that. I think overall the market in the fourth quarter was down slightly and we were down a little bit more. Most of our decline had to do with actually exports. I think on a Continental Europe basis, we are right in line with the market. Some of the exports that we had in Africa as well as in the Middle East which are a little bit slower, but, again, I do not read into that much at all, because it was the fourth quarter which is always seasonally slow. I will point out and we have talked about this in the past that 2016 is an even numbered year and typically even numbered years, there are many events including the World Cup, including various soccer matches that usually show a little bit better than the odd years, so we are coming off an odd year where the overall market as well as Ball was up about 2%, so kind of in line with what our expectations. Depending on weather and depending on some other things, I think 2016 we see the same trends continue in Europe with growth in the beverage can at the expense of returnable glass and other substrates. 
Mark Wilde: Okay. Can I get you to make kind of some of the same comments just around Latin America? I think with all the difficult economic conditions down in Brazil, but at the same time we have got the Olympics coming up down there, any thoughts about that in the entire region in '16? 
John Hayes: Yes. You know, it is interesting. As you all know, the first half of 2015, we were cycling off some very difficult comps from the World Cup in '14. What we saw, it was relatively soft in the first half. Then second half in Brazil picked up nicely. In the fourth quarter, I know the overall market was up 6%; we were up a bit more than that. I think a lot of the trends that we have talked about in the past continue, meaning, that the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer category. I think specialty growth is occurring at a faster rate than standard containers. We are almost at, not quite, but almost at a 50-50 mix between standard and specialty down in Brazil. As we go into 2016, yes, there is a lot of political uncertainty and economic uncertainty, but the facts have not shown that the beverage can has been hurting. People are still eating, people are still drinking, and I think while the Olympics in Rio is a help, people have to remember it is only just the Rio region, but that is a very densely populated area, so I think it should be beneficial. As we sit here today, we are not expecting large growth in Brazil, but the can is holding up very well relative to other substrates and relative to other industries.
Mark Wilde: Okay. That is great. I will turn it over.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks. Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Scott Morrison: Good morning.
Scott Gaffner: Just wanted to go back to the guidance for a minute, I think you talked about - if I heard correctly, flattish free cash flow or similar range free cash flow 2016 versus 2015? Was this…
Scott Morrison: That is correct. 
Scott Gaffner: …but you also said all the segments ex-China you are expected to see some improvement, so is it predominantly FX or some pension headwinds or what is causing that the variance between those two?
Scott Morrison: Well, both of those statements are correct. I mean, if you think about '15, it was a year of a lot of headwinds. We expect most of those headwinds to dissipate as we go into '16. Currency will have less of an impact, we will have less start-up costs, we will have a little bit in the first quarter, but then that should dissipate and some of the one-time things we experienced in '15, we do not expect to experience again in '16, so…
John Hayes: I think the only other thing from a cash flow perspective is we kind of pointed out that we expect working capital will be relatively flat, so it is not a net inflow of cash, but we are going to have a lower CapEx as well.
Scott Morrison: Yes.
John Hayes: …and we will probably have some pension funding and other things year-over-year that maybe helps address the bridge you are trying to create.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. How much is pension funding 2016 versus 2015?
Scott Morrison: Yes. '15 we had a little less than $20 million globally of pension funding. In '16, we expect that number to be closer to $50 million of funding and expense will be down about $7 million year-over-year.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. When I look at the North American metal, food and household business, I mean the margins have been up fairly nicely this year from an EBIT perspective. I assume that part of that was because you got rid of some lower margin business with the customer transition, but is there a possibility for more margin improvement within metal, food and household as we move into 2016, just as you do not have to take a lot of that capacity out of the system in 2016 and you have got plants and end making facilities in the right locations at this point in time?
John Hayes: Yes. Let me kind of give a little different perspective, because I think about absolute EBIT in that business. You know, the loss of the announced customer contract obviously hurt, and Scott mentioned continued manufacturing inefficiencies and a little bit of start-up hurt as well. As we go into 2016, we continue to look at rightsizing our fixed costs and we are going to be accelerating those efforts in 2016, because while our margins were up, you are correct, the overall profitability was not where we hoped or expected, so we have a lot of programs in place to drive those earnings back to where we think should be normalized.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. Thanks.
John Hayes: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. In Americas and Asia bev, I think you indicated segment volumes were up 5%. I am wondering is it possible to parse that out between U.S., Latin America and Asia. Then just on Monterey, if you could give us a little more color? It sounds like the first-line is fully contracted out and running. I am just wondering can you confirm the second-line is contracted out as well.
John Hayes: Let me hit that first. Yes. We can, and it is going to be up and running, as we said, kind of a little bit later on this year, kind of three months to five months after the startup of the first-line, so call it late second quarter, early third quarter is a good way to think about it. Getting back to your volume question, in North America, we were actually up a little bit in the fourth quarter. Some of it driven by continued directly back filling some of the Monterey, Mexico volume that you had just referred to as well as continued decent growth on the beer side of the category. In Brazil, we were up nicely in the fourth quarter and even in Asia, even though we put no new capital in there, our folks have been able to squeeze out a fair amount of new capacity with our existing asset base and we were up about 10% or so in China as well. Overall, it was good volume growth in that segment.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That is helpful. Then just following up on Scott's questions on food and household, I guess segment earnings were down $45 million roughly from 2014 to 2015. Given the new capital projects you put in place, is it possible to frame how much of that you may be able to make up in 2016? I mean, is it half of it or most of it or could you even potentially exceed 2014 earnings levels in a really good year or just how should we think about kind of the earnings recovery potential in food and household in '16?
John Hayes: This is John. Why do not I take it? I think, as we said earlier 2015, there is no short-term solution to some of the issues here, but we expect it to be up meaningfully. Can we get back to the height of that profitability? Over time we expect to, yes, but it is not going to be happening in one year. It is probably a two-year to three-year to four-year program depending on how the end markets shake out. Recall, let me give you a couple of drivers of some of that stuff. On the aerosol side of tin plate, we have the new G3 technology that is out that Scott mentioned is on the shelf right now. Number two, in terms of overall aluminum aerosol growth, that continues to grow well. Just to give you a sense, in 2015, we were up on a global basis in aluminum aerosol about 5%, 6%, so that is good news and we are going to continue to drive that and our business is performing there and then we have got to get these manufacturing inefficiencies in our food can business in line.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That is very helpful. I will turn it over.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tyler Langton: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. I think, Scott, you mentioned that performance was lower in Brazil, but I think I guess you mentioned volumes were up more than sort of for you, more than the 6% for the industry. What exactly was driving that lower performance?
Scott Morrison: I mean I think there was a little price pressure, but nothing material but a little bit of price pressure.
Tyler Langton: When you said lower performance, did you mean results were down year-over-year or just a little bit weaker than you would have thought?
Scott Morrison: They were a little weaker than we expected.
Tyler Langton: Okay. Then just for Europe, I think you mentioned the premium benefit was €6 million and FX was a $20 million hit. Could you just bridge the gap a little bit more on profits? I think you mentioned plant utilization was a benefit this quarter and if there is any other factors driving the year-over-year increase?
Scott Morrison: Yes. A good chunk of it was the utilization, but they are also doing a very good job on the cost outside. They have been taking cost out throughout the year, so you are seeing the benefits of that as well.
John Hayes: Yes. The other thing I might add is recall on the October call, we talked about we had some of our pattern freight in the third quarter, because our Oss, Netherlands facility had come on stream, but not on stream in time to really have the high summer season, so as we went to a more slower season, we were able to balance out the footprint a bit better and get rid of some of that out of pattern freight and cost.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Okay. Then just last question. I think you mentioned CapEx of $400 million this year. Is that a fairly good number for you guys going forward sort of big investment years for CapEx?
Scott Morrison: I think that is a good number for '16, but we will see what kind of opportunities. We have been fortunate that we have found a lot of good opportunities Monterrey, Mexico would be a good example of that. Some of the things we are doing on the aluminum aerosol side, so we are finding good opportunities to put money to work and get the returns that we expect. Right now, as far as I can see forward in 2016, that is the number.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Scott, you talked about the first quarter being soft on account of China startup, food and household, the basket. Can you talk about what that implies in terms of any year-over-year change in earnings?
Scott Morrison: No. I think what I have said in my prepared comments I would stick by that. Performance is expected to be up in all the segments. China is the only one that will be softer.
Adam Josephson: Okay. One question…
Scott Morrison: Unfortunately, we are real limited as to what we can say…
Adam Josephson: Sure. 
Scott Morrison: ….in terms of outlook, so I apologize for being not as transparent as we would like to be.
Adam Josephson: Totally understood, one more question you might be able to answer it, perhaps not, but in terms of the Rexam deal, what exactly where you required to update in terms of your divestiture and synergy estimates if either when you issued the press release a couple of weeks ago regarding the divestitures in Europe and Brazil? What will you would be required to update along those lines when you provide the market with information regarding the FTC outcome?
Scott Morrison: Well, we updated in December when we sold bonds, so that is why we had to update until we get further along in the process and get definitive agreements in all these regions.
Adam Josephson: Okay. A couple of more, you talked about cash EPS. Are you planning to report both cash EPS and adjusted EPS once the deal closes or strictly cash EPS?
Scott Morrison: No. We will talk about both. Our focus is always on file to cash and so I just want to give people a heads up. With this transaction, there will be a fair amount of amortization. We will talk about both, but we will, our focus is on generating cash flow and so some of the accounting loses some of the context of the cash and to me the cash is the important part. We will give you both numbers.
Adam Josephson: Thanks. Just two more, pension expense I think you mentioned would be down $7 million in '16. Is that related to an accounting and did you make an accounting change similar to what other companies have been doing?
Scott Morrison: Got it No. We did not. That is just some things we did last year in terms of some buyouts of buyouts of closed plants and some of the changes in the interest rate assumptions both on the discount rate and then the return on asset assumptions, so the combination of all those factors led to that $7 million decrease. We did not change anything else fundamentally.
Adam Josephson: Got it. Just one more, in terms of the cash flow statement, you had that other line there was a $145 million benefit in '15. Can you just explain what exactly that was, Scott? Was it expense in excess of cash contributions or what drove that?
Scott Morrison: Most of that difference is the non-cash business consolidation cost that gets added back and the pension funding difference, I am sorry, in the other line. Yes, the pension funding difference would be the big part of it, expense versus funding. I mentioned our…
Adam Josephson: Right.
Scott Morrison: Our funding was only about $20 million, our expense last year was about $95 million.
Adam Josephson: Got it. Thanks a lot, Scott. Appreciate it.
Scott Morrison: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
George Staphos: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott Morrison: Good morning, George.
George Staphos: Good luck with all of your processes here. I guess the first thing I had, I wanted to go back to aerospace and the significant jump that you saw in the well, not the backlog yet but totally in terms of contracts that you have won. I also recognize that you have got a lot of projects in the black that you cannot really talk about. To the extent that you can comment, what trends are you seeing in the contracts where you have been winning and what does it mean for the future of that business?
Scott Morrison: Well, George, I think from an, I will call, an end market perspective, a good amount of it is DOD. I think we have talked about this in the past, but NASA has been flat to down over a number of years but I think, as we talked about last quarter, with this new budget in place, the sequestration unless it goes away, sequestration is off of the table and there is a multi-year ability to fund programs that have been can lingering to the side. That is the vast majority of it. When you think about what we do for the DOD, it is everything from satellites to sensors, but whether it is optical or antenna type sensors. It is a whole mix of those various things. We are quite pleased and proud of our folks quite candidly, because it is not in any one place. It is not in only satellites or only tactical gear. It is not only in cost plus, it is not only in fixed price, it is kind of a blend of everything, so I think the portfolio effects of what has been won, but not booked right now we feel good about. As I mentioned, we have a whole bunch of other stuff we are chasing down as well.
George Staphos: Okay. John, I mean, I take from your comments that given it is a blend of everything, but you did not really highlight one or the other, you would prefer not to get into that but if you did not mind, do you have kind of a view that you could share with us on, again, fixed price versus cost plus or antennas versus satellites et, cetera?
John Hayes: Yes. A lot of it is classified, George, so I cannot but what...
George Staphos: Understood.
John Hayes: I would tell you is from a big picture perspective you have a sense of what the percentage is of cost-plus versus fixed price. You have a sense of what is our satellite business versus our tactical business versus our services business. It really isn't that different than what has been historical.
George Staphos: Okay. Thank you for the color on that. Next question I had for you, in terms of CapEx for 2016 and the figure that you cited. From a real world or practical standpoint, how challenging is it right now or is it, to plan on projects, fund projects when frankly you do not know quite how your portfolio will evolve over time for obvious reasons. Can you talk a little bit to that, again to the extent that you can comment?
John Hayes: Well, yes. Let me take a first stab at it. George, you raised a fair point, but where we are putting this capital is what we think is long-term good for Ball Corporation going forward so you talk about Mexico and putting a second line in a little bit later on. You talk about end capacity in Lublin, Poland and increasing the end capacity there. You talk about impact extruded of what we are doing, whether it has been in India historically, whether it is in the Czech Republic that we talked about. It is those types of things. I think if I understand where you are going is, pro forma any potential direction does that have any impact and all the things I just laid out do not.
George Staphos: That is great, John. That is where I was going with the very clever question. Next question I had for you just on food. This business has evolved, food and household, significantly, from the early 1990s. There have been good years and the bad years. Certainly, you have been cycling through some more challenging years. I am guessing because of the growth especially you are seeing in aerosol and household the answer is going to be no to this but I guess the question I still have is, has the business gotten, at least some elements of it, to subscale where you do not know that you necessarily have quite the same competitive standing that you might have had or would you say, where, Ball Corporation is pretty much as competitive as it has always been in the food business. If so, why would that be the case?
John Hayes: No. That is just the start. But its recall that everyone of our tinplate facilities makes both, food can and aerosol and so if it was just isolated in the food can you would start to think about scale, but it is not. We view this and we run this business as it come from manufacturing footprint perspective as a combined and we are able to leverage the manufacturing expertise because what we are talking about effectively is three-piece tin plate containers.
George Staphos: Okay. Last one and I will turn it over. You mentioned at least the implication is Brazil should be Brazil has been holding up better than expected. I forget what you said about the volume outlook for Brazil; I think you set up modestly or moderately for 2016. We have read some reports where some of the Carnival celebrations had been canceled because of all of the economic challenges. My guess is, again, you have not seen much effect of that in terms of your volume outlook, but to extent you have color one way or another, we would be interested in it. Thanks.
Scott Morrison: I think I would just give you a comment. The timing on Carnival will be different. My guess is that Brazilians have started celebrate Carnival. The timing is going to be a little bit earlier, so that will make the first quarter year-over-year a little bit challenging.
John Hayes: Yes, I think what we are planning for and expecting is post Carnival, which happens in, what, a week-and-a-half starts; We will start to see a seasonal slowdown, because that is their autumn and it will slowdown and as it starts to get into the second quarter. I think that is what Scott is referring to.
George Staphos: Okay. First quarter, you do not see that much of a challenge or you do? I guess, I was not clear on the answer there?
John Hayes: No. I think let me rephrase it another way. I think it is only four weeks into the year, but I think in January we are seeing exactly what we expected. We just know that Carnival is a bit earlier and much like when you have the Chinese New Year in China, when it is earlier or later it affects before versus after, so we did not see a huge run up prior to Carnival, but what we saw was certainly in line with what our expectations were. The question is what happens after Carnival.
George Staphos: Okay. We will leave it there. Thanks, John. Thanks, Scott.
Scott Morrison: Okay. Thank you, George.
Operator: The next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Philip Ng: Good morning, guys. Not sure if you started the asset sale process, but I am just curious if you are expecting much tax leakage and when do you expect to get your leverage back to your previous targets?
Scott Morrison:
Scott Morrison: We have pretty active plans in place as to how to minimize the tax leakage. There will be some, where we have I think pretty good plans to make it as small as we possibly can. Then in terms of leverage, we will have to wait and see until we are done, but our initial guidance was within 18 months to 24 months, we did leverage back down to a pretty comfortable level and I do not see a big change in that.
Philip Ng: Well, I would have figured that might come a little quicker, because the investors are shaking out a little higher, right?
Scott Morrison: They might. 
John Hayes: Yes. Time will tell. We are restricted by what we can say. So again, I apologize for that. We cannot comment any further.
Philip Ng: Okay. That is fair enough. Then I understand one of your customers that you are serving in Monterrey just announced another large area on the West Coast of Mexico. Is that an opening for you guys and will you need to add some capacity to meet that demand?
John Hayes: Yes. It is premature to say, but we have got a great relationship with that customer. It is the fastest growing beer company right now. You know, stay tuned. That is all I should say.
Philip Ng: Okay. Then on the aluminum premium, you gave some color on the quarter. Can you give us how we should be thinking about the potential tailwind going into '16? It seems like it was a little higher than we initially expected at least?
Scott Morrison: All I will say. I cannot just comment. I will give you a quarter. In the first quarter last year in '15 we had a €7 million headwind and that should essentially reverse in the first quarter of '16.
Philip Ng: Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Good luck to your Broncos in a few weeks.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Amen. There we go.
Operator: The next question is from Danny Moran with Macquarie. Please proceed.
Danny Moran: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you mentioned that startup costs are around $20 million in '15. Can you just help us with how much lapping of startup cost should benefit 2016 and maybe quantify the impact from Monterrey in 1Q '16?
Scott Morrison: I think, we should still have a little bit of a drag in the first quarter and then those startup costs should diminish quite materially, so our goal in '16 is not to talk about headwinds or tailwinds on too many other things. Hopefully, it is a more normal year, so I think we will get a little bit more cost in the first quarter then after that we probably won't be talking about it very much.
Danny Moran: Okay. Great. That is helpful. Then just on the pricing environment and European bev, there has been some commentary of some country-specific pricing pressure there. Can you give us your thoughts on whether you are seeing this as well and if you think it is an issue going forward?
Scott Morrison: Nothing out of the ordinary, we operate in a competitive world, so you always in today's world where the growth is anemic, I think every industry is having pricing pressures, but nothing of note.
Danny Moran: Okay. Last question for me, is there any way you could break out the metal bev packaging Americas and Asia segment in 4Q? I guess what I am asking is, were segment operating profits up year-over-year in U.S. and Brazil?
Scott Morrison: We typically do not get into that level of granularity. That is a segment that we report and that is how we talk about it.
Danny Moran: Okay. Good luck in the year, guys.
Scott Morrison: Great. Thank you.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Chip Dillon: Yes. Hi. Good morning, and I do apologize, being originally from North Carolina, I cannot really share those same sentiments regarding the Broncos, but hopefully you will answer my questions. Anyway, I guess the first question has to do with just to make sure I have the share count right, should we more or less take the diluted count that you averaged in the fourth quarter and just add that 5.7? I do not know exactly what the pace of buybacks were in the fourth quarter.
Scott Morrison: Yes. I would just add that 5.7 back for the beginning of the year. That is probably the best measure. The basic is 142,289 at the end of the year, including the 5.7 that we issued.
Chip Dillon: Got you. Okay. That is helpful. By the way, is there any reason you cannot continue buying back stock as we approach the closing of the Rexam deal?
Scott Morrison: No. We are not precluded from buying back stock.
Chip Dillon: Okay. You mentioned a decline in the corporate expense, and I think in '15 you had some retirements that might have impacted that number, but as we think about the future, to the extent you can tell us, as you envision the Company post-close, would the corporate expense line tend to change a whole lot? Maybe will there be more need for that number to be higher or would pretty much all the incremental costs not be in that line?
Scott Morrison: Now, I would not expect material changes and we would update you when we get to the closing and tell you what it is going to look like going forward.
Chip Dillon: Okay. Then on the CapEx, you mentioned 400 this year and is it fair to say that pretty much all of the first line plus I guess the original infrastructure and the new Monterey plant would be in the '15 number or is there a lot of carryover into '16. I would assume most of the second line would be in '16, is that at all fair?
Scott Morrison: There is a big chunk that obviously was in '15 that drove the numbers and then there is still a fair amount of carryover, John talked about a second line coming up here a few months from now. It is when you spend the money, right? Even though the capital, we may have gotten the plant up and running. It is when you are paying for all those invoices that it shows up. There is still a decent amount of carryover '16, we got some other projects in '16 that we are looking at on as well.
Chip Dillon: Okay. Then last question is, I know in the past you all have from time-to-time talked about penetration let us say in beer for example. My guess is in the U.S. it is somewhere in north of 50% and I am guessing Brazil is probably approaching 40%. If you could update us on that. Then John, you mentioned that Brazil is now a 50-50 market, specialty versus standard and I know there may be differences, say soft drinks, but where do you see the U.S. ultimately settling out in terms of specialty versus standard?
John Hayes: Yes. There is a lot of lot of questions in there. Let me just clarify. Our portfolio in Brazil is closer to 50-50. I do not necessarily think the overall market is, but to answer your question about where we think specialty can ultimately end up. Specialty continues to grow and 12 ounce continues to decline in all categories in the United States where it will ultimately get to. I cannot tell you. I can tell you we are in it about 30% of specialty in North America relative to the whole and that continues to grow, so we will look at the 50% I think it is premature to look out that way, but certainly the trends are saying it is going to get bigger, not smaller. Even on the beer side of the business, the can penetration, to answer your question there, I do not have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you that both, in the United States and Brazil, as well as most other countries, the can continues to take share relative to other substrates. For example, in North America, the overall beer market was up about 1%, cans were up about 2.5%, down in Brazil, the beer market I think was down slightly, but the can industry was up and that was largely driven by beer, so the implication of all that is it continues to take share.
Chip Dillon: I see. Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Rit Liu with Rogge Global. Please proceed.
Rit Liu: Hi. Good morning guys. Can you tell me what the operating earnings were in China for the last quarter?
Scott Morrison: We do not. That is part of our Americas and Asia segment. We do not break that out beyond what is publicly released.
Rit Liu: Okay. Can you give us any idea of the magnitude of the slowdown you are expecting in China next year?
Scott Morrison: Just qualitatively as we said, the volume continues to grow. I know the overall can market in China grew about 5 billion cans in 2015 and the growth continues. Again, similar themes is what I just talked about in North America as well as Brazil, but the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer segment. The problem is the pricing continues to deteriorate as well and there has been material deterioration in the pricing over the last six months, over the last 18 months. As Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, that we expect all of our segment results to be up save for our China business. The other thing he said was our cost out programs have been unable to keep up with the pricing declines, so we are battening down the hatches, we are focusing as much as we can on cost, but we do expect the results there to be down.
Rit Liu: Okay. Then you mentioned the tax rate of 25% for 2016, can you give me that what you think your cash taxes will be in '16?
Scott Morrison: No. Not at this point in time.
Rit Liu: Okay. Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Sherry with Loews Corporation. Please proceed.
Daniel Sherry: All my questions have been answered. Thank you.
Operator: All right, we have a follow-up from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Adam Josephson: Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just one on Brazil, Scott or John, you talked about a little price pressure there in the quarter, even though the can market continues to grow robustly. Do you expect that pressure to continue this year just in light of your volume outlook?
John Hayes: I like any market. It is a competitive market, so nothing out of the ordinary.
Adam Josephson: So really just a continuation of whatever trends you likely experienced in the fourth quarter?
Scott Morrison: , there is some lapping of that, but it was a little bit of price pressure. I would not read into it too much.
John Hayes: Yes. I agree I would not read into it too much….
Adam Josephson: Okay. Just one on the tax rate, Scott, I think you guided to 25% for '16. Obviously historically, forget about '14 and '15, but before 2014 the tax rate had been quite a bit north of 25%. Can you give us what you consider a normalized tax rate for the company long-term if that is possible?
Scott Morrison: Yes. I think I mean right now it is that 25%. When we did a restructuring in Europe a few years ago our tax rate had run historically closer to 28% to 29%, and with the things that we did it moved down to about that 25% is a decent run rate.
Adam Josephson: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Chris Manuel: Good morning or good afternoon gentlemen, depending where you are. A couple of quick questions, first, I want to come back to what you just talked about. I mean, I did hear you earlier in commentary talk about some price compression or price pressure in Brazil. To my knowledge, this is the first time you have ever raised this flag, so I respect what you just said that it is nothing unusual, but it is the first time I think you have ever mentioned it. Are you experiencing or do you feel you are experiencing some price pressure in Brazil today or how would we think about that?
Scott Morrison: I would think anywhere around the world that it is a competitive market. Like I said, I would not read too much into that comment. It is just anytime you are negotiating something, customers are trying to get what they want to get. We are trying to get what we want to get, so I would not read too much into that.
Chris Manuel: All right, fair enough, I am just noting this is the first time, I mean, you have been asked about it before, but it is the first time you have come out and raised that flag. Second question I had… 
Scott Morrison: I wish there was [ph] a flag.
Chris Manuel: Second question I had was you did quite a few projects in 2015, adding bev can plants, aerosol, all kinds of stuff. How should we think about the phasing as we work through '16 or how would we think about quantifying, if it is possible. What the impact will be as you start to get results from that all your hard work?
John Hayes: Yes. That is a good question. I will as best try and answer that. When you think about the projects we have talked about even on this call. Let us start with Monterrey, Mexico, it started up this month and so there is always a learning curve there and Scott said we would have a little bit of startup costs but so I would expect kind of the typical learning curve on something like this is three months to six months and so I think as we get to certainly the second half of the year, maybe even a little second quarter, we will start to see the benefit of that and then we are going to get additional leverage as we put the second-line on that is going to be starting up kind of late second, early third quarter, so you can hopefully see a trajectory there. In the fourth quarter last year, we started the new line in Devizes in the U.K. on the impact extruder line. We started up the India, plant. Any time you start up a new plant, the learning curve is a little bit longer than just adding existing line or new lines into existing facilities. I think that Devizes we feel pretty good about in terms of getting results out of that sooner rather than later. I think the India one is going to be a little bit longer. The Lublin, Poland we talked about that as we continue to ramp up the end production there we should see some benefit as time goes on, but it is a ramp up starting in early '16 as we go forward with that. We talked about the contour. In fact I know the last couple quarters we talked about the contour bottle as well as the G3. It is on the show, we are making commercially, commercial product right now that is on the shelves right now, so we have high expectations as we go into 2016 that you are going to see some momentum there. All of that leads to exactly what Scott was saying that in the first quarter we still have some startup costs and we are really not getting a lot of the benefits, but as we are gaining momentum each month we go by in the year 2016.
Scott Morrison: Hey, Chris. Let me give you a little bit more color on the Brazil comment, because I do not want anybody to leave with the wrong impression. What I probably should have said is price cost. If you think about what is going on with energy, metal and currency as it relates to Brazil that is really more of kind of the combination of all those things, so do not walk away thinking there is something different on price.
Chris Manuel: Okay. Actually that is helpful. Thank you. Last question, when these two new lines that are starting up in Monterrey, are they primarily geared to one size? Are those swing lines that are capable of producing different styles, types of cans or what type of capacity we added there? How should we...
John Hayes: We have added capacity with multiple size capability.
Chris Manuel: Okay. Can you tell us what the rated capacity for those is roughly?
John Hayes: There are state-of-the-art high-speed lines, so when you think about that, I think in the past we said once this all is up and running, we expect a couple of billion cans, so if you would divide by two that is 1 billion on line or so.
Chris Manuel: That is helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.
John Hayes: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.
Scott Gaffner: Thanks. I just had a quick question. The deferred tax provision in the cash flow statement, you had minus 61 in 2015. Is there a way as a benefit, is there a way to think about that as we go into 2016?
Scott Morrison: I would factor any changes into my comment on free cash flow. It is just kind of there is a bunch of puts and takes in the free cash flow statement for 2016, so I would just kind of incorporate that into what I expected free cash flow to be in total.
Scott Gaffner: Okay. All right, I appreciate it. Thanks.
Scott Morrison: Okay. Thanks. Tia, why do not we take one more question?
Operator: There are actually no further questions, so I will turn the call back to you.
John Hayes: Okay. Great. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your patience around our inability to talk about certain things and we look forward to speaking to with you in a few months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2015. And I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks, Lena, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding the company's third quarter 2015 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now with regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transactions to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction. Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in conjunction with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, please visit the Offer for Rexam page on our website at Ball.com. Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2015. Our third quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. The headwinds that we acknowledged throughout the year around earnings translation, project startup costs and tough volume comps in North American food continued while others like aluminum premium headwinds and tough volume comps in Brazil started to become slight tailwinds in the quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying these headwinds. As we said in July, overriding these headwinds are the investments we are making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. This week we announced that Ball's Brazilian joint venture partners are exchanging their remaining 39.9% interest in the joint venture for 6 million Ball shares. This exchange will allow us to further streamline our business decision making in the region and across the broader Ball metal beverage business as well as enable us to better serve our customer base and ensure that the beverage can remains a cost competitive package. While we are making progress on around the proposed acquisition of Rexam including ongoing work with the U.S. FTC, receiving the formal Statement of Objections from the European Commission and moving to the next stage with the Brazilian CADE authorities, we continue to remain focused day-to-day on maximizing the value of what we currently do and generating strong free cash flow. Growth capital projects that have become and or that we expect will become operational and we expect will largely benefit 2016 and beyond include the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in North America, which has made its way up the learning curve. In fact we were just there yesterday with our board and I want to thank all of the hard work by the folks in Conroe and elsewhere to help make this a success. In addition, the new Oss, Netherlands specialty beverage can line and the addition of end manufacturing capacity in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which both help serve European market growth in the quarter; the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico two-line aluminum beverage can facility, which is on track and on budget and will become operational by early 2016; the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar slated to open in early 2016, a new U.S. tinplate aerosol can manufacturing technology that shipped its first commercial product earlier this month; the expansion of our aluminum impact extruded container business in the U.K. is expected to come online during the fourth quarter. And our new impact extruded aerosol facility in India celebrated its grand opening earlier this month. We began to cycle off difficult volume comparisons in Brazil, and the aluminum premium comparisons in Europe in the third quarter, and our continued focus remains on executing on the capital projects, implementing continued cost out initiatives in China and Europe and awaiting award of a variety of aerospace proposals that are in the pipeline. I'm amazed by the amount of work being done by the Ball team. Everyone is contributing day in and day out to our future success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2015 were $1.10 versus last year's $1.10. As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the quarter: $0.07 of unfavorable currency translation, largely due to a weaker euro; $0.04 of start-up costs associated with capital projects coming on line in late 2015 and early 2016; and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.03; and $0.05 benefit from a lower year-over-year effective tax rate, due largely to the impact of our economic hedges put in place for the Rexam transaction; and on U.S. dollar borrowings in Brazil and some one-time discrete items. In addition, as mentioned in prior quarters, metal food volumes remain challenging in the third quarter due to the previously disclosed loss of a major food can customer in North America. Much of the difficult comparisons for 2015 are behind us, and free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $550 million, including approximately $500 million of CapEx, and excluding cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction. As we said earlier this year, our dividend will remain unchanged during the proposed acquisition process. However, we did opportunistically repurchase 2 million shares in the quarter. We will continue to view share repurchases as opportunity-dependent. For the full year 2015, here's an update on various financial metrics. CapEx will be in the range of $500 million, a $50 million increase due to timing on a number of projects being executed as we approach year-end. Interest expense will be roughly $150 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be closer to 24% following the third quarter impact that I talked about previously. Corporate undistributed is estimated to come in just below $90 million. Our GAAP results in the third quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics, though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings and could accumulate to a sizable figure given currency rate volatility and the projected timeline associated with the proposed transaction. We will continue to break out these items to provide as much transparency as possible. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.6 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.7 times. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at quarter-end to consummate the proposed transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. For a complete summary of third quarter 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the third quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations, our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the third quarter 2015 were down just slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing and slightly lower volumes in China and some project start-up costs in North America. Brazil volumes bounced back in the third quarter, up double digits versus an easy comp last year. And North American volumes were off just a bit versus the industry being up roughly 1% in the quarter. Progress continues on our Monterrey, Mexico plant, which will start up in early 2016. It appears our cost optimization initiatives in China cannot keep up with the further price erosion in that region. Much great work has been done by colleagues across the segment to support the cost out initiatives taken so far in China. And we will continue to monitor closely the situation, as well as the political situation in Brazil. However to-date, Brazilian can demand has remained strong. And we're off to a good start to their seasonal summer. European beverage comparable earnings were down around $3 million in the third quarter. And on a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Mid-single-digit volume growth and a slight benefit from aluminum premiums in the quarter were almost enough to offset the negative translation impact. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined mid-teens following the customer shift in U.S. food cans. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were up slightly with better pet food and salmon can volumes and upper Midwest vegetables faring well, offset by Midwest tomato yields being lower as the pact came to an end. This segment was also impacted by a couple million dollars of unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business, and a small amount of start-up costs relating to capital projects across the segment. We continue to ramp up the next generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology and further grow our global extruded aluminum businesses, which will all contribute to improving segment performance in 2016 and beyond. In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on the things that they can control, leveraging prior investments to serve the growing global demand for beverage cans and metal aerosol packaging, as well as preparing for new capital projects to come in online in early 2016. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for the energy, drive and enthusiasm and working together during what's been a very busy summer. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported a solid quarter, given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog held steady, ending the quarter at $638 million. The aerospace team continues to perform well on existing programs and is focused on reducing its cost structure as it anticipates projects being awarded in early 2013 (sic) [2016]. A side comment, I might just mention that the recent budget agreements in Washington, D.C. actually help us and takes away some of the ambiguity that we were facing into. Now turning to the balance of the year, this message is consistent with prior quarters. It's all about executing on capital projects, generating cash flow, focusing on costs, and reaching completion on the proposed offer for Rexam. Our outlook for the full year has not fundamentally changed since our last update. And while currency translations, start-up and pre-production costs will remain a headwind for the balance of the year, our business remains solid and is on track to generate a significant amount of free cash flow. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond. Now finally, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of and thank Mike Feldser and the excitement we have for Jim Peterson. As you know, earlier this quarter we announced that Mike would be retiring after leading our food and household product segment for 10 years. His commitment and dedication to our company and to our people are above reproach, and we will miss his drive. However, what we gain in Jim is a high energy leader who grew up in the commercial side of our business and we are very excited to build on many of the initiatives begun to make that segment world class. We wish them both all the best on their new journeys. And with that, Lena, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Thanks for all the detail. Actually, congratulations both to Jim and Mike, and Mike did a great job after he took over and the food performance is a lot better subsequent to that. I would say my first question is around operations. It sounds like China has maybe taken another step lower. Perhaps it's a mischaracterization, but can you comment in terms of what kind of trend you saw sequentially 3Q versus 2Q?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Maybe, George, I'll jump in and ask Scott to chime in. I think the good news is the beverage can continues to grow and take share in China. The bad news is the pricing has gotten worse. We have not been putting any capital in China for several years. We don't intend to because we don't believe with new capital you can make returns in it. So we are weathering the storm. We're battening down the hatches. We're taking out as much cost as possible, just to try and keep up with the price declines. And it's challenging to do that as we sit here right now.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I would just echo those comments. And that's why our volume was down just a couple of points, George, because we're not putting in additional capacity. So, it's a tough environment, and it continues to be tough. And I think the outlook is challenging.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Recognizing that this is always going to be the case in any quarter, any year, are you suggesting that there is maybe increased chance of capacity reduction? Because it sounds like you're having difficulty keeping up with the price compression through your own productivity.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well in terms of our own business, we're currently not contemplating that now. The real issue is there's too much over-capacity in the industry. And our industry is not alone in that. But the question is, with outside of our walls, will the market grow into the existing capacity? Will new capacity stop coming on stream? And could existing capacity be taken offline by other people? Those are the three things that we're paying close attention to.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, recognizing that you're sold out, there aren't higher cost operations that in theory, if you weren't running them, wouldn't help the P&L sufficiently? That's what I'm hearing.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. A couple of quick ones and I'll turn it over and try to come back in queue. You mentioned Monterrey being on track. Can you just remind us? Do you have a contract in place for that facility? And I think you said first quarter, but could you affirm when you expect to start producing commercially there?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Operations guys are never the one to get nailed down on it. We expect to be making cans starting up the line early in the first quarter and being producing commercial cans certainly by the end of the first quarter. When I say commercial cans, cans for sale. It might be a little quicker than that, but that's the plan we have currently on the table. It is secured by a long term agreement.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks for that. And then you mentioned EBIT was up in Europe, excluding foreign exchange. So, we appreciate that color, but is there any way to put a finer point on how much Europe would have been up ex the foreign exchange? Thanks guys. I'll turn it over.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well think about the currency effect I mentioned was $0.07. The vast majority of that's in the beverage business. There is a little bit in the food and household business, but the majority of that's in the beverage business.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you, Scott.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In food and household, you referenced positive volume trends with pet food in the Midwest. I'm just wondering, ex the large customer loss last year, are you seeing stability in the North American customer base? And in terms of your asset footprint in North America, are you comfortable where you are from a food and household perspective?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Absent the loss of the customer, we are seeing stability. I think we talked last quarter on the conference call about the vast majority of our business tied up in their long-term agreement and the overall market is holding in there. So, again, absent the loss of that customer, yeah we see volumes. In fact we were up just a little bit. But don't go crazy with that. I'm sorry, your second question was?
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just in terms of the footprint in North America, are you comfortable where you are from a food side going into 2016?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, as you know, in light of the loss of the customer, we've actually made some footprint rationalizations relative to head count and other things like that. And we're always looking at trying to optimize it. It's a challenging environment out there. And so while we have nothing currently on the docket in terms of any major restructurings, we're looking at those types of things all the time.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple of questions on Brazil, first, is there anything that motivated the timing of the acquisition of the remainder of the Latapack stake? And then when you look at Brazil into next year, the country is in a deep recession. Do you expect volumes next year to be positive in Brazil, given can continues to gain share, or what are your thoughts about can demand given current market conditions in Brazil?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well first with respect to your question about the timing of this, I don't think there was anything specific. Yes, we are in the midst of a regulatory approval and I can't go into that. But we've had a very good relationship with our partners for a very long time. And as the world has changed and as Ball has changed and as they have changed, it was just the right opportunity. We're quite excited about what our partners – that they have a conviction in the future of Ball. It does allow us to streamline some of the decision making. And I think really said another way, what they're not doing is our partners are not exiting Brazil. They're not exiting Ball. They're not exiting the beverage can. Rather, they're taking a broader perspective in the investment for the betterment of all. And so I think that's good. Getting to the volume side, as we go into 2016, the first half of 2015 was quite soft. And so, I think the comps are relatively easy. Scott had mentioned our third quarter volumes were strong. The overall industry was up 11% and we were up a bit more than that. As we start into the fourth quarter, we see the similar trends continuing so that's all good news. You're absolutely right that the Brazilian economy and the Brazilian political environment is a challenging one right now. I do know that less beer and less soft drinks are being consumed. But given that beer can growth continues, I think that's a good example of this constant theme we've been talking about of cans taking share in the packaging mix.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And when you refer to political challenges in Brazil, are you speaking specifically around taxes on beverage or maybe a more difficult tax environment for Ball, or what are the risks from a political perspective in Brazil?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. I was just specifically talking about the potential impeachment of the President and what that means in terms of a change of a guard around the political side of that, and ultimately what it means. We have no point of view on it. But anytime you have an unstable government, it's usually not healthy.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it, got it. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just following up on sort of the Latapack deal, I guess recognizing that you've seen a lot of your earnings variability over the two years, just given the effects of the World Cup, I guess could you talk a little bit about – I mean, I guess do you see this deal still hitting sort of the target level of returns that you look for that 9% threshold, and any kind of thoughts on sort of like a run rate level of earnings, if earnings can rebound from sort of the recent volatility? Just any details there?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I would say on the earnings volatility, it's been a pretty good, consistent long-term increase in the earnings in that business. The business has done real well. It does get a little bumpier quarter-to-quarter and it is a more seasonal business. But the overall long-term trajectory of that business has been very solid. We don't see that necessarily changing. I don't think we need much in the way of capital down there. And in terms of returns, this does meet our typical hurdles that we always look at in terms of we want to earn 9% after tax within three years, and this will do that.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay, great. And then just in Europe, could you quantify, Scott, the impact of the metal premium this quarter and then sort of if premiums to stay where they are, what that benefit could be in the fourth quarter and then looking out to 2016?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. It was a $0.03 positive impact in the third quarter. It should be a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter. And then we'll still get benefit in the first half of next year.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And then just final question for North America bev can, I think you mentioned your rates of growth were a little bit less than the industry. Could you just talk about how you're growing in beer and CSD and is that the lower growth rate, is that just sort of temporary customers sort of issues? Any detail there would be great.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It is customer issues. On the soft drink, we were actually a little bit better than the market on the soft drink side. We're a little bit worse than the market on the beer side. And all of our differential relative to beer had to do with one of our customers taking more of the business in-house.
Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Fantastic. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey. A quick question for Scott. To achieve your $550 million free cash flow target, at least based on our math, it's going to take $200 million plus of working capital benefit. So where are you finding some of those opportunities? And as a early read through for next year, can you help us kind of frame what are some of the major levers for free cash flow in 2016?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I'm just going to comment on 2015. I'm not sure about your math because I have a working capital benefit this year a little bit less than last year's benefit. We have a lot of charges coming through non-cash charges that maybe you're not accounting for correctly. Maybe we can take it offline. But...
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay...
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: But we had a big pension benefit as well. So I don't know if you're including that. That's part of the cash flow. In terms of looking at next year, every year, we're constantly looking at our working capital, whether it's receivables, inventory payables, and figuring out what we can do better, where we can be more efficient. So it's too early to talk about next year. But rest assured, being an EVA company, we're always focused on that.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess Europe, you guys called out a hit from some out-of-pattern freight. Do you expect that to dissipate in the coming quarters, especially with Oss ramping up a little more fully? And then are you at a point where you need to add some capacity in Europe? And did you see some pricing? Just the market seems fairly tight at this point.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's – getting back, we – remember, it is more seasonal in Europe than – the second quarter and third quarter, certainly, than even some other parts of the world. And we were just getting the Oss line up and running. And so as a result of that, right at the peak, we didn't have full capacity. So it did create out-of-pattern shipping. I say that because as we go forward, we expect that to become less as time goes on. You are right, the market is still tight. It remains tight. It's growing nicely. And as a result, we have to think of it longer term about if we need to add additional capacity into that. No final decisions have been made, but we're certainly thinking about that.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one for me; can you kind of help remind us what are some of the dates that we need to be mindful of in terms of the regulatory agencies as it relates to Rexam? And what are some of the – what's the process in some of the next steps you guys are taking going forward? Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Maybe what I would ask is to take that offline and give our Head of Investor Relations, Ann Scott a call because every jurisdiction is a bit different. And I wouldn't want to confuse people by misstating something here.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay...
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's all in the various documents that she can guide you to.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Morning.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered, could you give us some sense of kind of what's been pushing up the CapEx number as we move through the year? I think it started the year it was about $400 million, then we were $450 million and now $500 million.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Sure. CapEx is always a little bit tricky to predict because you always have plans. And the question is how fast are you actually paying for what you're putting in place? We've got some pretty big projects. John ran through the laundry list of projects. Monterrey is a big project. The next-generation aluminum bottle is a big project. The plant build in Myanmar, the impact extruded in the UK, the new India plant, the tin plate aerosol in the U.S. So we have an unusual amount of projects, kind of a higher number of projects than we typically have. And frankly, the faster we can get these things up and running, the better. So I don't look at the CapEx spend as a bad thing. I actually see it as a good thing. And the projects are moving along pretty well. And so, we're actually able to keep pace or even a little bit better pace than where we thought we would be. So that's why it's gone up. It's the same projects; it's nothing new.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Exactly. I think said another way, it's some of the carryover that we thought would be going into 2016 will probably be spent in 2015 because, as we said, we're making good progress on many of these.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Okay. So it's not like you've really had any big budget overruns on any of these projects contributing to that?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No. In fact, all of them, the businesses have done a very nice job of managing to budgets. And we generally tend to be on budget and on time or even a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Second question. John, can you talk a little bit about the implications of ABI, SAB and how that might affect you? Seems like particularly in Latin America, they're going to have a lot of market share.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I need to be careful because they're in a regulatory mode, as are we.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sure.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: They currently have a big market share in South America. So, I just observed that. I probably shouldn't go into it, but a lot of the things I read in the public around the United States, China, even Europe, I wouldn't disagree with anything that I've read so far.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then the last question I had is, I just wondered coming back to the Ball-Latapack, we can see what you paid for that 39.9%. I wondered if you could help us at all though get a range on what EBITDA down there has been running.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's a bit difficult because we don't – it's buried within one of our segments. I would point you to non-controlling interest on the P&L line, which is their proportionate share of net income that they have to give back.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And I think there's some other things in the public disclosure that Ann could probably help you with.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. That sounds good. Thanks very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Good luck next year.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple questions around Mexico. Are you starting both lines up at the same time?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. There will be about a three-month to five-month delay in the second line coming up relative to the first line.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That was planned for.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Just to be clear, that was planned. It wasn't really a delay. That's how we staged the ramp-up.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Got it, Scott. Okay. Then just the actual rate of capacity of each line and the expectation for how many cans you'll make this next year and in 2017.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me put it this way. The Mexican can market is growing quite strongly. And we're actually more excited, as we sit here today, about the opportunities ahead of us than we were when we initiated the project. The facility's going to be a state-of-the-art facility that has capability of approaching a couple billion cans.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, John, for that. And just last ones here on the Mexico side, can you just say how much of the couple of billion is contracted versus open and how much is new can business versus a share shift from glass into cans?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we feel real good about where we are. And as we said, we make these investments tied to long-term agreements, so I'll stand by those words. There is a lot of growth. The demographics in Mexico are good. The consumption is good in Brazil and the package share shifts are good in Mexico – excuse me. I mentioned Brazil. I meant Mexico. So you got three forces kind of as tailwinds for us there and the industry.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Got it. Just two last ones for me, so in North America and the U.S., taking a step back, just look at the CSD and beer trends over the last, call it, six months to nine months, do you think there's been any change in trend? And then just quickly on the food can side in the U.S., given that it's a smaller business, any thoughts around potential exiting the food can to be a lot more focused on aerosol, which is really where the growth fundamentally is?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. First, I'll answer that question. The answer is no. Recall, we've talked about this in the past that from a tin plate perspective, our food and tinplate aerosol business are commingled from a manufacturing perspective. Every one of our facilities where we make food, we also make aerosol containers as well. And so, we've had some challenges in the food business. No doubt about that. But we actually think we are kind of cycling, starting to see some positive headway in terms of the cost side of the business. It's not going to rebound quickly. We do continue to face challenges of overcapacity and that. But I do think that when combined from a cost of goods sold perspective with our aerosol container business, it makes sense. Getting to your question about North American trends, what we see over the last six months or nine months or so, I don't think anything really appreciably. I do think that you're continuing to see a very good strong growth in specialty. I think you're seeing – actually the beer industry doing a little bit better, particularly on the can side. And I think can continues to take incremental share of the package mix there. I do think CSD is, while it's still declining, it's not declining at the rates it once was, so that's a positive. So, I think all of this paints a picture that it's a bit more constructive today than it was perhaps nine months ago. But we're talking on the margin. I think a lot of it has to do with the economy. There's a lot of new housing builds. There's a lot of construction workers going into convenience stores, buying their energy drinks. Oil, the price of gasoline is cheaper which puts more disposable income in people's pockets. Typically when we see situations like that, we see a little bit more stability in our end markets.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very helpful, John. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good. How are you?
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good. Good. First, can you guys talk about what effects the customer consolidation and anti-trust-driven asset ownership shifts have on your business and the industry as a whole? And then how is Ball positioned to deal with that dynamic moving forward?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess just a couple observations. And again, like I said earlier, I'll be a bit more general than perhaps you'd like. But consolidation in our markets generally isn't new. Our customers have been consolidating. Our suppliers have been consolidating. Our competitors have been consolidating. And we too have played a part in that consolidation. I do think in today's world, it's important to – where there's not as much growth around the world than there has been, I think people are looking for efficiency savings and the ability to pass those on to the end-user at the end of the day. And I think a lot of this consolidation is driven by that. So outside of that, this is a world that we've been living in for probably the past 20 years, if not, longer than that.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then earlier, you mentioned one of your North American beer customers taking capacity in-house. Is this a dynamic that you guys expect could continue moving forward in the industry, especially as consolidation accelerates?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think this is a unique situation. But I do think that as maybe some third-party customers of that entity continue to be soft, they try and incrementally fill that in. So it's not a necessarily new phenomenon, nor one that's surprising to us.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then one last question. Can you guys provide any detail on intra-quarter trends by region? Anything that stood out.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Intra-quarter, you mean...
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Like full quarter trends year-over-year?
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, just kind of things developed throughout the quarter. Did anything change meaningfully from the beginning to the end and kind of into October?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, I see what you're seeing. Well, we mentioned Brazil was – we've seen decent growth in Brazil when people were expecting it. And sequentially, quarter-over-quarter we saw through this year Brazil getting stronger, and it continues to. Again, some of it's off of weak comps of last year. Some of it's their entering the summer. I think over in Europe, I think as the year has gone on, I think you've seen some strength. I do think that we're entering into a seasonally slow fourth quarter. And so it's always difficult to make predictions around that. But I don't think in Europe or North America, we've seen any appreciable deviations from any trends.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes. Good morning.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: The first one has to do with the composition or the changing composition of the standard beverage can in North America, or beverage cans in general. Could you talk a little bit about how much share you have seen the craft beer sector get, at least versus glass and other substrates? Do you have any updated data on that? And where do your customers see that going? And then secondly, within CSC, is – are water becoming a meaningful proportion? And I sense that you're underrepresented there. And are there moves to address that?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Maybe I'll take a stab and Scott can chime in here. First on the craft market, we're very bullish and very excited about what's going on in the craft market. I don't, off the top of my head, have all the exact data points that you're looking for. But craft continues to be the fastest growing category of the beer in North America. The can as a share of the package mix continues to increase. It's in the mid-single – excuse me, mid-teens. And as we talked about in past, that's up from virtually nothing a while back. It is a more complicated business because the run sizes are a bit smaller than others. But we've spent a lot of time, effort and energy helping to support and helping to grow the craft market, and we are committed to that. I think it's a great longer term opportunity for us. And we're going to continue to try to do the most we can because any time you have a category that's winning and you have a container that's underrepresented, it provides opportunity. So that's the way we look at that. With respect to – I think you mentioned water. And it's an excellent question. We have, as Ball, been really focused on sparkling water, in particular. Water, we are – the can is underrepresented. On the still side of the market, candidly it's quite challenging just because the price points of that water and PET, it's – PET has become so thin it's almost like you're buying water out of a bag these days. And it's difficult for the can compete into that. And furthermore, when the consumer thinks about the can, they think about carbonation. They don't necessarily think about still. And so, our focus has been on the sparkling water category, and we've had some wins in that.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Got you. And then I think I noticed on the release today that there was a very large, I think, hedging loss. And I think that was tied to financing for Rexam. I didn't notice the UK pound moving that dramatically in the third quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about what gave rise to that?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. It's mostly currency and some interest. We're hedging about £2.3 billion of the purchase price that we have to pay in sterling. So you don't need big changes in rates to have a meaningful impact on the GAAP earnings. So, it's really the hedges we put in place right after the transaction and the movement of the currency over – in the first quarter – or second quarter, we had a big gain, if you recall, and then in the third quarter, had a big loss. So that was the volatility I was talking about in terms of impacting our GAAP earnings.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Gotcha. And last question. You've been good to give us the details of the several projects, or the numerous projects you all have going on around the world in the legacy Ball. Assuming things go as planned with the closing of Rexam, would we expect to see a material slowdown with the expansion, I guess, in terms of thinking of the legacy Ball business? Or would we see that continue?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the best way to think about it is bandwidth. And as we've moved to close with Rexam, we want to make sure that it's a seamless and flawless day one and day 100 for our customers. And we're going to be really focusing on the execution and delivering on the commitments we set out for ourselves, our investors, our customers, et cetera. To the extent that there are capital investments that are good growth opportunities that meet our return objectives, we'll certainly consider that because remember, this acquisition is as much about trying to create an environment where we help the can be as sustainable as possible and leveraging the footprint of the combined entities so that we can service our customers even better. So, if there's opportunities that fit within that window, we'd certainly look at them. But I do think if you said you have to prioritize, our prioritization is going to be on the execution of flawless day one, flawless day 100 and flawless day 1,000.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I see. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. Couple questions on the new projects. If you can comment at all in terms of the next-gen aluminum bottle, what's unique to it? When do you think we'd start seeing it to a larger degree in the market? And then similarly, on the new tinplate aerosol technology, if you're at a position right now to comment at all in terms of what's new, what it does for the customer, what it does for you in terms of process supply chain, et cetera.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, both of these are new technologies. They both have significant lightweight opportunities relative to the current out there. And even on the aluminum, it's – we would have the ability to shape it. And so where we are right now is, both of those are coming out of a startup curve. But there is a whole supply chain filling that needs to occur. I think as time goes on and we're sitting here at the end of October, I think over the – in the fourth quarter, you'll start to see more and more of each of these. And then, I really think as you go into 2016 is really where you'll start to see the difference.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And, John, if I could, and I appreciate the details that you already relayed. On aerosol, what end markets would we possibly see this in?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's an aerosol container.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tinplate aerosol container. So think that. And we've been able to lightweight it, while maintaining the rigidity characteristics for allowing it to hold high pressure.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So you're saying we'd see it pretty much in everything from WD-40 to spray paints to starches to bug spray. So it's basically the whole waterfront.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it has that capability. I'd rather, at this time, not get into the specific customer-by-customer. But you're thinking about it correctly.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. I appreciate that. In terms of the Aerospace backlog, it's been holding steady. Obviously developments in Washington have been out of your control. Is your sense that where there has been an opportunity to gauge your progress that you are at least maintaining market share on awards that have been made? And if you could give a little bit more color on the recent agreement, why that helps you out in Aerospace? You mentioned that takes away some uncertainties. If you can give a little bit more color in terms of how that uncertainty was impeding your progress there, or at least your customers' willingness to commit.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think most Americans don't realize that if we had not gotten a budget deal that the sequestering would have gotten worse, not better, and it would've reduced defense budgets, not maintained or even increased them slightly. And that's what this proposed new budget deal is, is a slight increase into that. We haven't had a budget for I don't know how many years. And so we've been working under continuing resolutions for so long, which is kind of just status quo. This allows our government officials to mix and match a little bit more. And as I said on prior calls, we have more proposals in with our customers than I've ever seen at Ball Aerospace. And if we didn't have a budget deal that would've put some of those at risk. And so that's why we feel pretty good about where we are. These, as you know, George, because this business is – it's a portfolio of you either win or you either lose. And so on a probability basis, we have to factor in these things. And so we look at it from a portfolio perspective. We have candidly not one, one or two things this year that we are hoping to, but not expecting to necessarily. But as we get more of these individual discrete programs awarded, I think the portfolio broadens out, and we fully expect to win our fair share of that portfolio.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. I'll circle back maybe a little bit later on on end markets here as well. But last question and I'll turn it over. Start-up costs, Metal Food, did you call that out? I know you mentioned it in the press release. But if you mentioned the dollar amount, I missed it.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: More of the start-up costs were on the beverage side, but there was $1 million or $2 million of start-up on the food side as well.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question coming from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Just a couple of follow-ups and both related to questions George just had there. One, in the release you mentioned the stabilization in backlogs in Aerospace. John, can you give us a little more color on why you're confident that that's taking place?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's stabilized because we had some big programs remember in 2014 that had rolled off and we completed. And that started a kind of a decline. I do think it's kind of leveled off and it's kind of at a steady state. And as I said, we have so many different programs that we're bidding on right now, I just don't want to – it's difficult to be tied down to the exact timing of not only when you're awarded them, but then when you sign the contract. But we expect the next, call it, three months to six months to be a very busy time around the bids and proposals we have outstanding with our Aerospace business.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Did you say that you'd either won a couple recently or that you hadn't won a couple recently?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. We had not won a couple recently.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Okay. And then the other question I had is just when you think about sort of all these projects across Ball, is there any way to size sort of what the headwind from start-up costs is across all those businesses in 2015 and 2016?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think we've been calling it out each quarter in 2015. So start-up in the quarter was $0.04, and for the year it's about $0.09.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: For 2015.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. And would you want to make any stab at what that might look like next year, Scott?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, it should come down. I mean I think there'll be a little bit of ramp up in the first quarter as Mexico comes online and Myanmar comes online. We're bearing some of those costs today. So, you're hiring people and training them at other plants. But as we move through next year, those costs should come down.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's good. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, gentlemen.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I have just actually one question. Most of mine have been asked already. As you're now eight months or so into the process of bringing together Ball and Rexam, you've I think previously said that, and even in your release cited first half 2016 as approximate time still for closing, so two questions related. One, perhaps now that you're this far down the path, do you have a better sense of when closing could be? Could it be more first quarter, second quarter, or potentially slip to later in the year? And then second piece of the question is, you'd established a cap, I believe, of I think it was $1.58 billion at the time. As you now are pretty far down the path, again, with agencies and folks in three different continents, do you have a sense as to perhaps would you be higher or lower, or how that might be progressing as well? And any thoughts with respect to timing of potential divestitures, if there are any?
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate all those questions and I'd love to answer them. But quite honestly, and given UK takeover code, it's premature to update any of our guidance. And at the time that we think it makes sense to do so, we will do so. I know that's not the answer you want to hear, but that's the truth.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No problem. I understand. The last question I had for Scott was, and I know you've been asked this a couple of different ways. A lot of the projects that you've undertaken, and you moved CapEx up a number of times, I think as someone else had noted. These sound like they're move ups as opposed to new projects being brought on stream. So, as we kind of think about 2016, would it be unreasonable to assume that you don't have a big slew of new product announcements or new – I'm sorry, new capacity announcements that you've had this year that CapEx shouldn't be appreciably lower?
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, first, I would say that the changes to the CapEx, we increased it by $50 million in the last quarter and $50 million in this quarter. It has more to do with the timing of the spend than the totality of the spend. The totality is not any different. There's more pull forward from 2016 into 2015 because these projects are moving along at a pretty good clip. And so when you have the number of projects that we have and the size of the projects we have, you're always hoping they will go well. And frankly, they've gone pretty well. So the spend, we're getting the opportunity to get these things up and running a little bit quicker. Those are the projects we have on the table right now. We haven't announced anything different or beyond that in 2016. So it's premature to comment on 2016. But we're spending a heck of a lot of capital this year. I would expect that to come down somewhat next year.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Last question coming back to aluminum premium and I think you did detail what it was for the quarter and the plusses and minuses for the year. But could you just remind us cumulatively the last few years, what's your behind? And any change to the thought process that – I mean you haven't changed the number of your contracts yet, I don't believe. Help us triangulate around or make our guesses as to what the benefit might be in 2016.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, in 2014, it cost us about €13 million. In 2015, we've kind of detailed out each quarter. For the year it's a negative $0.06. For the quarter it was a positive $0.03. I said in the fourth quarter it'll be a little bit more positive than that and then we'll have more benefit in the first half of next year.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Do you remember what it was in 2013, by chance, as well? I think you were still behind coming out of 2012 and into 2013, if memory serves.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: €8 million to €9 million.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful.
Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Okay.
Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, everyone. One quick one on Aerospace; to the extent that you can, and recognizing perhaps you can't just because of the confidentiality on some of these arrangements, your backlog and some of the projects you hope to win, maybe saying it differently. Which areas of specialty or value add will we see the show up in relative to what Ball does well? I didn't phrase that well, but you know what I mean. So is it more DoD? Is it more vision systems? Is it more deep space explorations? Or any way to categorize where you're seeing more of the interest in what you do in Aerospace? Thanks, guys. And good luck on the quarter.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, George. It's an excellent question, and in some ways it's across the board. I mean when you think about our Aerospace business, we have a services business which is really a – sometimes the backlog – there really isn't that much of a backlog because it's an IDIQ type of arrangement. But that business has been growing. And the backlog visibility in that is kind of a close to a 12-month cycle than a three-year or four-year cycle. On the NASA, NASA's been declining as an industry. The U.S. government hasn't been funding it to a level. We see some longer term opportunity. But that's probably not a lot in terms of what we see in the near term. Really the near term gets around the DoD and whether it's in our Satellite business or in what we call our Tactical Services business, which has everything from the cameras to antenna work. And we see big builds on the horizon for some of those types of things and that's where the opportunities are coming from.
George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you, John.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions.
John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Lena. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate your help. And thanks for the support of everyone. We look forward to speaking with you as time goes on. And a good finish to 2015. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-31 11:00:00) =====
Executives: John Hayes - Chairman, President and CEO Scott Morrison - SVP and CFO

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 30, 2015. And with that, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John Hayes: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding the company’s second quarter 2015 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company’s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don’t already have our earnings release, it’s available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball’s proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to four areas. Number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release that was published in February; number two, where we are in the regulatory process; number three, the outcome of the Ball Special Shareholders Meeting; and number four, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction. Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the Offer for Rexam page on Ball.com. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our Company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the second half of 2015. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations and the operations are fundamentally strong. The headwinds we acknowledged in early February and late April around earnings translation, aluminum premiums, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in North American food and our Brazil beverage can operations continued and deferred compensation costs related to director retirements flowed through in the quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying what we believe are transitory costs and headwinds. In total these headwinds represented approximately $0.23 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.39 year to date. As we said in April, overriding these headwinds are the investments we are making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. As you know, February 19 we announced a proposed offer for Rexam. Earlier this week Ball shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the share issuance proposal and I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their support of the Board's recommendation. While we continue to make progress on the process around the proposed acquisition of Rexam, including our ongoing work with the US FTC, moving to Phase 2 with the European Commission and formally filing with the Brazilian regulatory authorities, we remain focused day to day on the maximizing the value of what we currently do and generating strong free cash flow. Growth capital projects that have become and/or will become operational that will largely benefit 2016 and beyond include the next-generation aluminum bottle shaping technology in North America which is in the midst of ramping up to commercial speeds although it has been a bit behind schedule due to the learning curve of this new technology. The new Oss, Netherlands specialty beverage can line and the addition of end manufacturing capacity in our existing Lublin, Poland facility which both came online this quarter; the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico two line aluminum beverage can facility, which we still expect to become operational in early 2016; the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar, slated to open in early 2016; a new US tinplate aerosol can manufacturing technology which is in the process of starting up as we speak; the expansion of our aluminum impact extruded container business in Europe which we expect to be operational by early 2016; and the construction of a new aluminum impact extruded aluminum facility in India which is expected to come online by year-end 2015. Moving into the back half of 2015 and excluding North American food we will cycle off difficult volume in aluminum premium comparisons and our near-term focus remains on executing on the capital projects, implementing continued cost-out initiatives in China and Europe and finalizing and closing a variety of aerospace proposals that are in the pipeline. I'm proud of the amazing work being done by all the people at Ball. It truly is a team effort to manage through these multiple projects and the acquisition process at the same time. And with that, I will turn it over to Scott for a review of our second quarter numbers. 
Scott Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second-quarter 2015 were $0.89 versus last year's $1.13. As John alluded to, four main factors contributed to lower results in the quarter: $0.12 of unfavorable currency effects largely due to a weaker euro, $0.05 for deferred compensation costs associated with two long-standing Board members' retirements, an aluminum premium headwind of $0.04, and $0.02 of start-up cost associated with capital projects coming online in the second half of 2015 and early 2016. In addition metal food and Americas beverage volumes remain challenging in the second quarter due to the previously disclosed loss of a major food can customer in North America, anticipated lower year-over-year beverage can demand in Brazil following last year's World Cup and continued weakness in US carbonated soft drink. Much of the difficult comparisons for 2015 are behind us and free cash flow was still expected to be in the range of $600 million excluding cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction even after a $50 million increase in expected capital expenditures. As we said in April, our dividend will remain unchanged during the proposed acquisition process and we are not precluded from acquiring Ball stock. However, the allocation of capital towards share repurchases will be opportunity dependent. For the full year 2015 here's an update on financial metrics. CapEx will likely be in the range of $450 million, up $50 million from our previous estimate given year-to-date project dollars spent. Interest expense will be roughly $150 million excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The effective tax rate is now expected to be closer to 28% due primarily to the geography of earnings. And corporate undistributed will come in just below $90 million which includes roughly $10 million related to director deferred compensation costs recorded in the second quarter. In June the Company issued $1 billion of 10-year senior notes at 5.25% which follows the March redemption of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes. Our GAAP results in the second quarter were favorably influenced by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings and could accumulate to a sizable figure given currency rate volatility and the projected timeline associated with the proposed transaction. We will continue to break out these items to provide as much transparency as possible. Details on these economic hedges are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release and will be explained in more detail in our 10-Q. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBITDA interest coverage at 5.5 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.7 times. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at quarter-end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the Company. For a complete summary of second quarter 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations, our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings for second-quarter 2015 were down $15 million year over year, mainly due to production curtailment in Brazil due to lower volume versus year-over-year comparisons and unfavorable pricing in China. In total segment volumes were down low single digits as North America carbonated soft drink demand continued to be soft. Progress continues on capital projects to serve the increased demand for specialty containers and metal beer packaging in Northern Mexico as well as cost optimization initiatives in China and US beverage end manufacturing. European beverage comparable earnings were down just over $14 million in the second quarter; however, on a constant currency basis they were flat year over year. Unfavorable earnings translation, €6 million of aluminum premium headwinds and start-up costs outweighed low single-digit volume growth in the quarter. As a result utilization rates are very high and out of pattern freight is occurring. That will likely continue in the third quarter though aluminum premiums will ease as we move through the remainder of 2015 and help offset these costs. As we said in the first quarter we still expect on a euro basis for our European beverage business to be up year over year. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter as segment volumes declined mid-teens following the customer shift in US food cans. The segment was also impacted by a couple million dollars of unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business. We continue to ramp up the next-generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology and further grow the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe, India and the United States which will improve segment performance in 2016 and beyond. In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on strengthening their capital base, improving processes and driving efficiencies. Thank you again to everyone working together to make Ball's metal packaging businesses even better. With that, I will turn it back to you, John. 
John Hayes: Great, thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported solid given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $641 million and anticipated reduction year over year as we await word on the program bids that have been moving to the right a bit. The employee base at aerospace continues to perform well on existing programs and has been rewarded with amazing images of Pluto and its mountainous surface courtesy of Ralph, a Ball-built camera that traveled for a decade to reach its destination aboard the New Horizons mission. Now turning to the balance of the year and echoing our first quarter comments we have a lot of execution in front of us now and in the near future to reap the rewards of the capital projects coming online in the second half of 20 15 and early 2016 as well as reaching completion on the proposed offer for Rexam. As we have said previously we've been facing transitory costs, some of which are beginning to abate whether it be aluminum premium or project start-up costs. Our business remains fundamentally sound with some hard spots and some soft spots. In our North American beverage can business we're excited about our new facility starting up in Mexico. Our specialty volumes continue to grow and the announcement yesterday regarding our Bristol, Tennessee end manufacturing facility positions us well from a cost point of view going forward. In European beverage we're facing a very tight supply-demand situation but we expect tailwinds related to aluminum premium to occur and our cost-out work continues to make progress. As Scott mentioned this gives us confidence to say the full-year will be better than 2014 on a constant currency basis. In Brazil we're cycling off some very difficult comps and the economy remains weak with GDP expected to decline this year and inflation over 9%  However, as we look to 2016 we do have easier comparisons to look forward to and we have the Olympics in this region which should be a positive. In Asia, we've had very good cost management ongoing in a difficult pricing environment and we are fundamentally sold out. However, we have no expectations of investing in additional capacity unless we can generate appropriate returns. Our food and household products business is truly a tale of two cities. On the food side of the business, the loss of a large customer and a very challenging pricing environment due to a new competitor is forcing us to batten down the hatches and it will be challenging for the foreseeable future. However, on the aerosol side both the tinplate and the aluminum businesses are growing nicely and our current investments in these businesses here position us for a solid future. Lastly, in our aerospace business, we've had generally good execution and there are several sole-source programs that we had initially expected to hear about by now. We do expect to get these late this year or perhaps early next year. So, in summary, our outlook for the full year has not fundamentally changed since our last update in April. And while currency translation, start-up and preproduction costs will remain a headwind for the balance of the year our businesses remain solid and are on track to generate a significant amount of free cash flow. Together we are working hard to improve Ball for 2016 and beyond. And with that, Keith, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Mehul Dalia: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Can you give us an update on the impact of aluminum premiums in the back half and in 2016 at current rates in your estimation? 
Scott Morrison: Yes, it kind of peaked in the first quarter. It came down, it was €6 million in the second quarter and then we expected it to be a tailwind in the back half of the year. We won't quite offset the amount of cost, increased cost that we had in the first in the second half. But then we'll continue to see benefit as we move into the first half of 2016.
Mehul Dalia: Great. And next given that CapEx is going up $50 million and you are reiterating the $600 million of free cash flow, can you tell us what's reconciling that difference on the other side?
Scott Morrison: Sure. Great working capital management both from an inventory standpoint as well as a payables standpoint. So that's why we're ahead of schedule on those items which is offsetting the increased CapEx. 
Mehul Dalia: Okay. And just one last one, do you feel the $600 million of free cash flow you're going to generate this year, is that a sustainable baseline going forward?
Scott Morrison: Well, it all depends on CapEx opportunities going forward. We're investing quite a bit of money this year in projects that we're very excited about. So it really depends on how the world goes forward and what kind of opportunities we can uncover. But there shouldn't be -- we've gotten a lot of money out of working capital in the last few years. I don't know how much more we can get out of working capital. It will still be a source this year. But each year I think that we get closer to the end of being able to generate those kind of benefits so we'll see. 
Mehul Dalia: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Chip Dillon: Yes. Good morning. My question has to do, first one is, when you look at the capacity situation in Europe you mentioned how constrained it was. Could you first tell us in general where you have to ship from and two, to balance that market? And then secondly I know that Rexam has announced and had talked about a number of either projects that they actually are undertaking or had planned to at some of their analyst days in the last couple of years. And do you think those projects will be enough to rebalance the market? I'll put it that way, or do you think more capacity may be needed as you look out to 2017 and 2018? 
John Hayes: Chip, from our perspective first remember that we had our Oss facility start up in the second quarter and it was kind of in the summer. And so as we go into 2016 we think some of the additional capacity with that will help alleviate the situation. But right now when you really think about where our growth has been, Germany continues to be strong. I think that's the biggest market. And these as you know are very regional markets and historically we had had to ship out of Germany into other areas and so as that continues to grow we keep it in the local German market and that has just put pressure on other areas. So I don't think there's one answer in terms of the out of pattern freight. I think it comes from a number of things. But certainly it has been costing us the money. With respect to question about Rexam given where we are in the transaction and UK takeover code I probably shouldn't answer that. 
Chip Dillon: Okay, I understand that. And then you mentioned the timing of the CapEx being, causing the year guide to be up $50 million. Do you see that coming out of next year? In other words, do you think that next year's CapEx would be roughly $50 million lower or do you think there are other moving parts, other opportunities you might be seeing then? 
John Hayes: Yes, it's a little bit of both, Chip. I will start first and then turn it over to Scott. But I do think we are spending more capital this year than we have perhaps ever if not a very long time. And I do think there is a little bit of pull-forward in terms of what you're talking about. But as you know we look at all projects on a bottoms-up basis and if there is good return generating projects we'll chase them. There are a couple of things we're looking at right now but it's premature to comment on it. But I think all things being equal unless we see these good projects you should expect CapEx to come down.
Chip Dillon: Okay. And last quick one is, you mentioned the segment volume as down low single digits, I believe for the Americas beverage segment. And you did mentioned the soft, weaker soft drink volumes in North America. Could you give us an idea of how you did if you can by specific region within the Americas?
Scott Morrison: Yes, I'd be happy to. I think the overall market was down about 1%. We were down a smidge more than that. I think from a soft drink side we were kind of down and in line with the market. We were down a touch more on the beer side relative to the market. And I might point out that beer was up about 1% in the North American market. We were off a little bit more just because a customer was taking more volume in house. And so that had a little short-term dislocation but as you know we've been selling on the beer side, selling cans to a customer for filling down in Mexico and export back into the United States. We were off a little bit more just because a customer was taking more volume in house. And so that had a little short-term dislocation but as you know we've been selling on the beer side, selling cans to a customer for filling down in Mexico and export back into the United States. So that's been helping us. But I think overall soft drink was about down in line with the overall industry and we were off a touch more on beer just because of this mix issue I mentioned. 
Chip Dillon: And Brazil and China?
Scott Morrison: On Brazil, we were -- the market was off almost 10% I think. We were a bit better than that. We were off just a smidge on that. But there was some mix issues in there where from a mix perspective we our specialty volumes were down more than our standard volumes. And then on the Asia side there is continued decent growth from an industry perspective but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we were roughly flat just because we are sold out.
Chip Dillon: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tyler Langton: Yes, good morning, thanks. Just on metal food and household, I guess could you give a little color in terms of the year-over-year decline in profits, how much was volumes or price mix and start-up costs and how to think about those trends going forward? And if there's cost out there that could help as well?
Scott Morrison: I mean just to give you a context I think the volume, the loss of volume is the biggest part of it. The pricing environment has been challenging. Last year I think we made more in the second half than we made in the first half, that I do not expect that to happen this year. But I also see it as kind of a low point in that business. And we continue to take cost out and aggressively pursue that. And so kind of have a new base to start from as we go forward. As John mentioned on the aerosol side that business continues to perform well. Both on the tinplate and the aluminum side, we're seeing growth and that's why we're investing in those growth areas in India, U.S. and in the Americas. 
John Hayes: Yes just to provide a little bit more color around that, on the food side of the business our volumes were off roughly 25%. But actually when you exclude the loss of that big customer we were actually up slightly. On the aerosol business around the world we were up about 3%. And so what you see is excluding that customer it was a lot of volume as Scott mentioned, excluding that customer I think on the aerosol side we're actually doing pretty good. It's just this very challenging volume and pricing environment we're seeing on the food side. 
Tyler Langton: Got it. Okay, and then just switching to Europe, do you have a sense how much I guess either your volumes or how much the market was up in Germany and how much that growth is contributing to your overall growth?
John Hayes: I think -- I don't have the exact numbers in front of me but I know Germany was up double-digit percent. We were probably generally in line, maybe a touch less than that only because of this type demand, supply-demand situation I mentioned. But the quote comeback of the can in Germany continues. 
Tyler Langton: And then I mean is that the main I think you said your volumes were up low single digits in the quarter. Is Germany the main driver or are you seeing growth in other markets as well?
Scott Morrison: When you look at it from an industry perspective and where Ball is strong you know the overall market as you know we're strong in Germany, we're strong in France, we're strong in the Benelux region, we're strong in the UK and in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland. And you look at some of those regions and while I mentioned that Germany continues to go well I think France was relatively flat, the UK was down 3% or 4%. The Benelux region was down low single digits and Poland driven by a very soft beer was down as well. So that's impacted us but I think we overall performed pretty well despite more or less on the beer side it being softer than it has been.
Tyler Langton: Got it. Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question from line of Philip Ng, Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Philip Ng: Good morning, guys. FX aside, how much of the transitory costs you guys called out earlier do you expect to incur for the full year and will that essentially go away next year? 
Scott Morrison: The increase from the directors' retirement that was $10 million. That was a one-time hit obviously we don't expect a hit like that again. I would say metal premiums that's the other big one that was dragging on the first half of the year. It will be a benefit into the second half and then a benefit into the first half of next year. Then start-up costs, a lot of these projects come on early 2016. So we'll see start-up costs coming through the P&L through the back half of this year and then it should dissipate as we get into 2016. So those are the big ones. 
Philip Ng: Okay, that's helpful. I guess framing this longer term excluding Rexam closing do you expect your EPS growth to get back on track to your long-term 10% to 15% growth target in 2016 and possibly north of 2014 levels?
John Hayes: To the issues that we can control, I'd rather not talk about the 2015, but to the issues we can control we actually feel pretty constructive about all the investments we're making. We knew that 2015 was going to be tough for all the reasons we've talked about that we do believe to be transitory. So when you think about those headwinds in 2015 becoming tailwinds as Scott was just alluding to and then the operating performance of the capital deployed we ought to be getting back on track. 
Philip Ng: Okay, that's helpful. And in the announcement you guys had yesterday about shutting down a canning plant in North America, how much cost-saving should we expect? 
John Hayes: We didn't quantify it. It doesn't happen until the middle of 2016, so we have quite a bit of runway before we get to that. So we'll update you as we get closer to that. 
Philip Ng: Okay. But we would expect the type of return you normally would have for any projects, you kind of talked about the costs that you're incurring for it? 
John Hayes: Yes, it's a better way to rebalance our end making capacity in North America. So we expect to get the same kind of returns. 
Philip Ng: Okay, very helpful. 
Operator: Your next question is from line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. Just to follow up on Chip's question on Brazil, is it possible to quantify the impact of the curtailments there either from a volume or an earnings perspective? And looking at the second half would you expect those curtailments to continue or maybe accelerate with the tough economic conditions there? 
John Hayes: Well again -- this is a seasonally slow time in the second quarter and then the weather starts to get better as you move to the back half of the year as their summer starts. So I would expect it to improve in the back half of the year. We also if you recall last year with the World Cup the first half of the year was very strong and then it really slowed down in the third quarter. So our comps get better in the third quarter. So I would expect that curtailment to reduce considerably as we move to the back half of the year. What was the other part of your question, quantifying it. All I'll say is we were short -- the amount we were short and I discussed it in the relative impact, Brazil was probably well more than half of the shortfall and China pricing was the other part of it. 
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. And then just for the second half for Brazil would you expect, and apologies if I missed this but would you expect volumes in the second half to be flattish, modestly up, modestly down? 
John Hayes: We expect the volumes in the second half of the year relative to 2014 to be up. It's a function of how much for two reasons. Number one, Scott mentioned how soft it was in the second half last year. And then number two, you know the can continues to do well in Brazil. As I mentioned the overall economy is soft. I know beer production is down, I know soft drink production is down but the can continues to take share. So how much of a year-over-year improvement I think it's too early to tell. We're not expecting significant improvement but there should be improvement. 
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful. And then switching to food I think you referenced competitive headwinds that might continue in the foreseeable future. At least one of your competitors has made efforts to lock up customers in longer-term contracts and they've indicated that the vast majority of their customers are covered under these contracts that maybe at least insulate them from pricing pressure in the next couple of years. Is that a process that you've undertaken? Is there a way of understanding how you've engaged your customers to protect yourself from pricing pressure in North American food in the next couple of years? 
John Hayes: Yes, I would say the vast majority of our contracts are under long-term agreements as we speak right now. But let's not forget this is not a new phenomenon in terms of people knowing a new capacity was coming on stream over the last couple of years. And so this pricing issue isn't just happened several months ago, it's been going on for a while. 
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question from line of George Stephos with Bank of America. Please proceeds.
George Stephos: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I want to start off in Brazil. John, did I hear you say that specialty cans were down a bit more for you than your standard can? And if I heard you correctly then am I then to assume that's just a function of macro weakness and consumer maybe going down in price or what was it? 
John Hayes: I think it was -- well let's be clear on my comment. My comment is directed to the second quarter which is the seasonally slowest. I think it was just a mix issue relative to customers. I don't think it was something bigger term because I know year to date the trends in specialty are in line, it was just more of a second-quarter phenomenon. 
George Stephos: Okay. Now this question comes up fairly frequently right around earnings season. Some of the other packaging substrates in the market in Brazil, producers of those would suggest that in this kind of environment where economic weakness is pervading that you're going to see a shift back towards returnable packaging because of economics and that in fact you'll see one way slipping. Recognizing that your customers tend to be much more one way and that's one of the reasons that you've been gaining share up until now, are you seeing anything in the marketplace that would suggest that returnable are going to regain market share? And if you could qualify or comment on that that would be great. 
John Hayes: You know, George, the short answer is no. We often talk about can penetration as a share of the beverage market because that's the easiest thing to measure where it's still in the mid-40s in Brazil. I do know in the second quarter it didn't improve but it didn't decline necessarily either. And again I don't read too much into the second quarter in Brazil because it is seasonally slow. But we haven't seen any reversal of those longer-term trends towards one-way packaging in the can in particular.
George Stephos: Okay, thanks, John. Now in terms of the food business in North America, can you comment as to where you stand with your efforts to either regain some of that lost volume and/or realign your production to deal with the new realities? And maybe the answer is we've completed and we are where we are with volume. But can you comment as to either your ability to regain some new volume either in food or in other applications and again what you've been able to do to lower the cost structure given the new environment? 
John Hayes: Well, yes. First on the volume I'm not going to go into great detail but we don't expect any significant changes in our volume relative to overall industry volumes as we go forward. We're very much more focused on the cost side of our business. And the only thing I'd say is we have, are and will continue to drive cost out of that business because we've got to be as low cost as possible in that business.
George Stephos: Are the plans in place and being implemented or is there more yet to come say later this year and into 2016 that has yet to be implemented and for that matter a gain garnered from? 
John Hayes: Well, a little bit of both. We've done a lot on the cost side but as I said when you lose that much volume it's always difficult to cover off all the costs at once. So some of the things that we've already executed on aren't completed and we are always looking at new ways of trying to take cost out of our business because we've got to be competitive from a cost side long term, full stop. 
George Stephos: Okay, last one and I will turn it over and recognizing it's going to be a little bit harder to project because you're relying on ultimately the government to turn on the funding. But if you win your fair share of the projects that you believe you have a right to compete in, would you see your backlog getting back to $1 billion say within the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks, guys. 
Scott Morrison: Yes, you know there has been a slow leak in our backlog. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do know that there's a couple of things out there that we fully expect the government to fund and we fully expect to win. So I don't want to declare that within 12 months that we will be at the $1 billion that you mentioned, but it should be meaningfully higher over the next 6 to 12 months without question on that. Can we get to the $1 billion? We could, but I think it's too early to tell because that involves some competitive environments. And if we win our fair share, we should be able to, but we've got to win our fair share.
George Stephos: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.
Mark Wilde: Good morning, John; good morning Scott. Scott, I wonder if you could just help us as we look into 2016, sort of think about the impact from aluminum premiums if they just stay where they're at right now, on your businesses around the world?
Scott Morrison: If they stay where they're at, we'll get a nice benefit in the first half of 2016, a bigger benefit than we're going to get in the second half of 2015.
Mark Wilde: And does that all show up in Europe, or do you pick that up in Brazil as well? 
Scott Morrison: No, it's mostly Europe. 
Mark Wilde: Okay. And is there any way to quantify or help us think about how big that number might be? 
Scott Morrison: Well, I said -- I'll give you some direction. In the first half, cost us -- I said 8 in the first quarter. It was actually a little bit lesson that, and then it cost us another 6 million in the second quarter. We won't quite get all that back in the back half of 2015. And then we'll get more than that recovery in the back half of 2015, we'll get that in the first half of 2016. So that kind of gives you the direction on the numbers. 
John Hayes: And those were in euros.
Scott Morrison: Those are euros.
Mark Wilde: Yes, okay. But just given the extent of the drop in premiums right now why wouldn't it be even bigger? It looks like we're back, we've given up maybe three years of premium increases? 
Scott Morrison: Yes, but the increases came relatively steadily and then just really peaked in the first and second quarter of this year and then they quickly dropped back to that lower level. So we're going to get everything that it has cost us but it's going to take the back half of this year and the first half of next year to get it all back. 
Mark Wilde: Okay. All right. Just stepping over to food cans for a minute, is there a point where the business shrinks enough that you've got just kind of a suboptimal footprint?
Scott Morrison: Well I guess there's theoretically there always could be. We're certainly not there now. The loss of the customer did take it out and we've been rationalizing certain facilities. And don't forget when the food and household products segment, our tinplate business from a manufacturing perspective, our facilities make both food cans as well as aerosol, so there's a balancing act there that as food has contracted aerosol has been growing as well. So you've got to keep both of those in mind relative to our plant footprints. 
Mark Wilde: So you can use the plants in a couple of different manners than?
Scott Morrison: Yes, exactly. We acquired -- when we had got into the tinplate aerosol business back in I guess it was 2006 that was one of the strategic rationales that we could combine and leverage the cost base of making effectively what are three-piece tinplate containers. 
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then John, is there any way that you would have us think about the potential for what the beverage can might get back to in Germany? I think right now it's about 4 billion cans, 3.5 billion, 4 billion. How do you think about that? 
John Hayes: Well I think about it since 2003 everyone has been articulating a point of view that if we could only get back to that 6 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion where it was. I don't have the numbers the exact numbers of the top of my head right now but we're back, we're making nice progress on it but we're probably half or less than half of where it originally was. I do think it's quite positive that all the major discounters now are listing the beverage can in Germany. But this is not an overnight flip of a switch and so I think there is we see sustainable growth in the German can market higher than other substrates because it had been off the shelf. And whether it can get back as I said to that 7 billion within X period of time I just don't want to guesstimate on that because that's what it would be.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And the last question I had was just to come back on that aerospace issue. It seemed like in that third quarter of last year you were thinking you might hear on a number of these contracts by late last year or early this year. What's been the issue with the delays? Is it just paralysis in Washington or what? 
John Hayes: Yes, there's just a lot -- there's two things going on. Number one, we did lose one contract that we had hoped to win and we can't hide from that. But then all the other ones, we had some as I mentioned I remember last year that we had already won a number of commercial things but the issue is they need to get funded and they haven't been funded yet. And that's taken longer than we expected. And then some of the things in the government I don't know if you'd call it bureaucracy or sliding to the right but the procurement side of the government is undergoing change right now. And I do think in some areas it's causing us some delays as I mentioned the things that we have a line of sight to we're not concerned about. There's some things that we ought to win and it's just a function of when and that are expected to be funded and then there are some competitive things out there as well in addition to all the commercial things. So I know it has been a little bit slower than even we would like but I think longer term we're not that concerned about it. 
Mark Wilde: Okay. Listen, good luck in the second half of the year and into next year. 
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher Manuel: Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions but two different areas. So first area, wanted to talk a little bit about some of the activity down in Mexico. You have two lines going in Monterrey but it sounds like you're seeding some cans in today from North America. Can you give us a sense as to of the two lines that you'll bring up A, timing you said early next year both the lines coming pretty close together for timing? And then two, what portion of what you're bringing on-stream will replace what you're seeding going in? Maybe a little color, a little help there would be useful.
John Hayes: Well first in terms of the construction of our facility we expect the first line to be up in early 2016, then realistically kind of three, four months behind would be the second line. We are just starting to cede those things -- cede cans from some of our North American facilities into there. We're eating a lot of freight as a result. But that's why I think some of our CapEx we're really focused on getting that plant up and running as soon as possible because I think we get a lot of operating leverage not only for making cans locally and getting up the learning curve quickly but then also saving from the freight side of the business. In terms of the exact amount year over year, our customers have been growing very strongly. So I think it's masked but it's certainly well less than half of what we expect to make in Mexico even on the first line when we get up and running.
Christopher Manuel: Okay, that's helpful. And from an end perspective being you're growing in that area is there opportunity to redeploy some of the I think the equipment you put in at Bristol was relatively new as part of the end, the rebalancing you did maybe five, six, seven years ago. Is there opportunity to potentially redeploy some of that down that direction to balance supply that way?
John Hayes: Actually, let me correct a misunderstanding. The equipment when correct a misunderstanding. The equipment when we recapitalized our ends a number of years ago it wasn't in Bristol, it was in Golden, it was in Findlay, Ohio and so the Bristol equipment is not state-of-the-art. As a result of that it does not make sense to redeploy that capital and so what we're looking at using some of our existing facilities to fill that out.
Christopher Manuel: That's helpful. Thank you. One last question actually is you mentioned you may be able to help us with some of the timing at some of the different elements of the process where you are with the Ball Rexam transaction. What are the next milestones? So with respect to the process going under way in Europe, with respect to here in North America and in Brazil as well when we begin to get a sense or when you might begin to get a sense as to potential divestitures to begin that sale process what are the next timing milestones that we would see?
John Hayes: Unfortunately due to the takeover code the only thing I can do is refer you to the 2.7 documents that lay out a lot of the timing.
Christopher Manuel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from the line of George Stephos with Bank of America. Please proceed.
George Stephos: Hi, everyone. Three quick questions. One of your peer companies was out today and they said this in the past that they're seeing signs of maturity in the specialty market. We think there are some customer-specific factors at work in relation to that comment but could you comment at all if you've seen any signs of maturation of specialty in North America either in terms of growth rate in demand and/or price compression? Second question I had, I seem to remember back a year or so ago that was some commentary that maybe you might be looking at some investment in specialty cans in China or Asia but that would have to, maybe it was just standard cans, but that would have to be done in a way where pricing and return was satisfactory. Since we haven't had any kind of announcement in that regard is that a function of the fact that you just have too many irons in the fire or that the pricing dynamic really hasn't changed much at all in China? And then the third, kind of segueing on Chris's question, so again project net was very helpful to you from an end module standpoint. Are you going to have to add equipment here did you say to offset Bristol or are you able to get it out of existing productivity in your existing end modules? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Yes, thanks that's a mouthful George. Let me try and take it. First you talked about specialty and the maturation of specialty. Specialty is a very broad category. And so when you get into it do we see a maturation of say 16 ounce? Yes, we do see a maturation of 16 ounce although that's been growing nicely. But our bottle cans continue to grow very, very strongly and so when you look at the spectrum within specialty you're always in any industry in any new product you do have a maturation but as then what's about gen 2, gen 3, gen 4 around quote, unquote specialty. So I know that's a bit of a vague answer for you but that's what we see and so as a result we don't see the category slowing down. Certain pockets within that category may slow down but others may accelerate. Second, with respect to your question about Asia specialty, actually we've done a lot of work in terms of Asia specialty by converting some of our standard capability to have flex capability or swing capability. Just to give you a highlight I'm actually pleased to report for the first time ever our specialty as a percent of total in Asia is above 10%. Not three, four, five years ago we did nothing and it's grown double digits so far this year, so I think we're in good shape on that. And then lastly with respect to net your question is about project net, recall that when we did project net that was five, six, seven years ago and the market has declined materially. And so what we're going to endeavor is to sweat our assets and use as many as possible to replace the capacity that we'd be taking out.
George Stephos: Okay. And just the question on China and Asia was really more around pricing. I seem to remember that there might have been a project like a new plant or new lawn that you were considering potentially if returns on pricing had improved. So I may be wrong but I don't remember a new project coming out, so that suggests the pricing returns haven't really improved. Could you confirm or correct on that? Thanks again.
John Hayes: Yes, George, you have a good memory. Yes about a year ago or so and that may be nine months we were looking at a new facility and pricing has not improved to a point that we were satisfied with the returns, so we had halted that project.
George Stephos: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] It looks like we have no questions there.
John Hayes: Okay great. Thank you, Keith, and we appreciate everyone's support and we look forward to engaging people as we move forward on our conference call at the end of October. Thanks all. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and you can now disconnect your lines.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-05-02 11:00:00) =====
Executives: John Hayes - Chairman, President & CEO Scott Morrison - SVP & CFO
Analysts: George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ghansham Panjabi - Baird Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Philip Ng - Jefferies Tyler Langton - JPMorgan Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Chris Manuel - Wells Fargo Anthony Pettinari - Citibank Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Al Kabili - Macquarie Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO. Please go right ahead, sir.
John Hayes: Thank you, Tommy and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2015 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at Ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the UK Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to three areas. Number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release. Number two, where we're in the regulatory process. And number three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction. Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction and UK takeover rules. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdictions. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the quote offer for Rexam page on www.Ball.com. Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and I will then finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2015. We've had a pretty challenging start to the year as the headwinds we acknowledged in early February around earnings translation, aluminum premiums, project startup costs and tough volume comps in North American food and Brazil all played out in our first quarter results. While not unexpected, they were a bit more pronounced given the first quarter is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying what we believe are transitory costs and headwinds. I will note, however, that our businesses are fundamentally sound with the majority of the headwinds coming from currency translation, metal premia in Europe and startup costs from our various projects. In total, these headwinds represent $0.16 per share in the quarter. Overriding these challenges are the investments we're making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. As everyone who follows us knows, on February 19 we announced a proposed offer for Rexam PLC that has been unanimously recommended by its Board of Directors. While we continue to make progress on the process around the proposed acquisition of Rexam -- I'll provide a brief update later -- we're very focused on maximizing the value of what we currently do and have quite a number of opportunities that are at various levels of investment, whether it is the next-generation aluminum bottle shaping technology in North America for a customer under a long term contract which is coming online this quarter; the new Oss, Netherlands specialty beverage can line that is just coming on stream and the recently announced addition of our and manufacturing capacity in our existing Lublin, Poland facility. The construction of the recently announced Monterrey, Mexico two-line aluminum beverage can facility with the majority of its capacity secured under a long term customer contract which will start up in the first half of 2016; the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar that is scheduled to begin in early 2016; a new U.S. tinplate aerosol can manufacturing technology that will begin commercial production mid-year, expanding our aluminum impact extruded container business in the UK and the construction of a new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, both of which we expect to begin production later this year; or the chasing of several billion dollars of outstanding commercial and governmental opportunities in our aerospace business. As we move through 2015, we remain focused on ramping up these capital projects and profitably growing our business. We're investing in our future, focused on continuous improvement, growing our cash flow and adhering to our historical disciplined, EVA-based capital allocation model, at the same time making investments which are largely tied to long term customer commitments. Regarding the Rexam transaction, we're in the midst of the various regulatory reviews around the various jurisdictions and our conversations with the regulators are going as expected. We have received an anticipated second request from the FTC in the U.S. and discussions are ongoing with the European and Brazilian regulators. We will keep you updated as and when there are material facts to discuss. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2015 were $0.69 versus last year's $0.81. As John alluded to, three main factors contributed to lower results in the quarter. $10 million after-tax or $0.07 of unfavorable currency effects largely due to a weaker euro. An aluminum premium headwind of $0.06 and $0.03 of start-up costs associated with over $200 million of growth capital projects coming online in the first half of 2015. In addition, the previously disclosed loss of the major food can customer North America and anticipated lower year-over-year beverage can demand in Brazil following last year's World Cup were also factors. To sum up what will likely be a question during Q&A, we continue to anticipate significant free cash flow generation in 2015 in the range of $600 million excluding cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction. It is expected that our dividend will remain unchanged during the proposed acquisition process and we're not precluded from acquiring Ball stock during this process; however, the allocation of capital towards share repurchases will be opportunity dependent. For the full year 2015, here's an update on certain financial metrics. CapEx should be in the range of $400 million as project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be roughly $147 million excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The effective tax rate now is expected to be just over 27% and corporate undistributed will increase closer to $90 million due to deferred comp costs related primarily to the retirement from long-standing Board members and the deferral of their stock which will hit in the second quarter and then corporate undistributed should decline to less than $20 million quarterly run rate thereafter. In February, the company entered into GBP3.3 billion sterling unsecured bridge loan agreement to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the proposed offer for Rexam and we also entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing $1.1 billion bank credit facility we had, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. The redemption of the 6.75% and 5.75% bonds totaling $1 billion resulted in a pretax charge of $57.5 million in the first quarter. Also in the first quarter, we entered into economic hedges to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition for Rexam. And also entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed transaction. Details on these economic hedges are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release. As a heads up and given the size of the proposed offer for Rexam, these economic hedges can and likely will cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings and could accumulate to a sizable figure given currency rate volatility and the projected timeline associated with the proposed transaction. We will continue to break out these items to provide as much transparency as possible. As a result of all the debt-related activity in the quarter, net balance sheet debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.3 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite strong with comparable EBITDA to interest coverage of 5.6 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.8 times. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and to provide ongoing liquidity for the company. For a complete summary of first quarter 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release which includes the simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were flat year over year with excellent North American performance offsetting difficult comps in Brazil following last year's World Cup where our volume was down mid to high single digits in the quarter. As we commented in the earnings release, China volumes were up in the period while profitability was relatively flat year over year due to lower pricing in the region. Within the segment, we're orienting growth capital to serve the growing demand for specialty and beer packaging in northern Mexico. The majority of the new Monterrey plant's capacity is under a long term contract and the plant will ramp up in the first half of 2016. European beverage comparable earnings were down just over $26 million in the first quarter as unfavorable earnings translation accounted for roughly half of the decline. $8 million of aluminum premium headwinds and $3 million of start-up costs associated with the Oss and Lublin capital projects outweighed relatively flat volumes in the quarter. As I said in February, on a constant currency basis, we expect European beverage operating earnings to increase in 2015 as the aluminum premium headwinds and start-up costs ease second half of 2015. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter as segment volumes declined midteens following the well telegraphed customer shift in U.S. food cans. Excluding this customer shift, our volumes were flat versus industry volumes down mid-single digits through February. The segment was also impacted by a couple million dollars unfavorable earnings translation related to the European aluminum aerosol business. Our global extruded aluminum product line continues to perform at a high level and global aerosol volumes have held up well year to date. We continue to focus on improving manufacturing performance, ramping up the next generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology and further growing the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe and India. There will continue to be difficult quarter-over-quarter comps in the food and household segment throughout 2015 related to the customer shift. In summary, our global packaging businesses are focused on executing on an extraordinary amount of capital and systems projects. It's an exciting time and an amazing amount of effort is being put into improve an already exceptional set of assets. Thank you to everyone at the plants and the folks that support them at the corporate level. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported a solid quarter given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $714 million and anticipated reduction year over year as we await word on program bids that are in process. Our capabilities and products are well positioned as affordable solutions and there are a number of awards that we expect to take place throughout 2015. The employee base at aerospace continues to perform exceptionally well on existing programs and just this month was awarded its third consecutive Boeing supplier award for high performance avionics as well as a silver Supplier Excellence award and a business management award from Raytheon for our work in the tactical products area. Now looking out across our company today, we have a lot of execution in front of us now and in the future to reap the rewards of the capital projects coming online in the second half of 2015 and early 2016 as well as reaching completion on the proposed offer for Rexam. In the near-term, our businesses are generating significant free cash flow. From a comparable net earnings perspective versus 2014, the best we can do is offset everything other than the currency affects that are expected to continue through the rest of 2015. While metal premiums and startup costs will persist as headwinds in the in the second quarter and currency translation will remain a headwind for the balance of the year, our business remains solid. Everyone at the company is working hard day and night and day in and day out improve Ball for the long term benefit of our fellow shareholders. And with that, Tommy, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will have our first question with George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
George Staphos: I'll ask two questions and turn it over. John, to the extent that you can comment on the Monterrey facility, the startup seems to be quite quick relative to the announced date. Now certainly, you're not novices in building beverage can plants but can you comment as to what hurdles may exist at all in building the Monterrey facility? Why it seems to be coming out so quickly? Can you comment at all in terms of the length of contract with the majority customer there? And then I had one quick follow-on. Thank you.
John Hayes: The reason why we're moving expeditiously on this is because the customer is in strong need of cans for their business. We have been working with them for a while on this so this is nothing new. I do think that the startup that we have all hands on deck with respect to it. We're moving dirt, we're starting to put in -- build the facility as we speak right now. So while it may look like it's a quick start up, we're pretty confident that will be able to achieve that. With respect to the customer contract, I'd rather not go into detail other than to say it is a long term contract for their beverage can needs.
George Staphos: And then related beverage packaging question. Can you comment all in terms of the next technology in aluminum bottles, a new shape and size initiative that you have. Anything you could share here would be great and will turn it over.
John Hayes: Yes, George, whereas I mentioned I think in my comments and even on the February 5 call, we expected it to be starting up late in the first quarter/early second quarter and that's exactly where we're. It is new technology so it always has its ups and downs. But as I said before, we have all hands on deck getting product into the warehouses so that we can sell to the customer as we move forward. We're excited about the technology as it is a version 2.0 relative to the Alumi-Tek bottle and I think from a capability point of view, it's going to show the world that we're doing some pretty neat things in terms of aluminum bottle cans.
Operator: We will proceed to our next question, it's from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Just in light of where the first quarter shook out, can you just sort of give us an updated view on the 2015 volume outlook for your various end markets and geographies?
John Hayes: Yes, sure, Ghansham, let's start in North America -- let's start in the beverage can businesses. In North America I don't think we see any appreciable changes. What we're seeing is strong specialty growth and that's largely offsetting the standard 12-ounce container declines. I think the market was off in the first quarter almost 1%. We were off a touch more but nothing appreciably and it just had to do with timing of certain things. The same trends that we've seen historically we continue to see here which is softer 12-ounce, stronger specialty, continued penetration in the beer category. But the overall beverage category is to be relatively flat to down. So the can is generally winning relative to other substrates. I think in Europe, the market was up a couple of percent. We were roughly flat, up very slightly. But again it was first quarter. Recall that 2015 doesn't have any special events related to World Cups or European championships and so we expect a couple of percent growth in the European market. I will say that we're hand to mouth right now relative to cans as we enter into the summer. So the capacity is quite tightened. It's important that our folks are working well on getting the Oss capacity up on stream. Down in Brazil, we were impacted this first quarter largely by customer mix. We service a customer that wasn't doing so well and another customer that we don't service was doing much better. So, we were down a little bit more to the market. But we had anticipated the overall market to be to be relatively flat for 2015 and I think that's exactly what we see. And so, we think our volumes will normalize as we go through the balance of 2015. And then in Asia, as Scott had mentioned on the February 5 call, we're seeing good volume growth but unfortunately the pricing environment is very challenging, so it's really not contributing any more profits to where we're. And we expect the volumes to continue probably not as much as in the first quarter. We had a little bit later of a Chinese New Year and so I think that helped out. We saw strong growth. The industry was up about 17% and so we don't expect that but certainly double-digit growth as we go into 2015, we would continue to expect. And then on the food and household product side, you know on the aerosol side, we're doing well both on the aluminum and the tinplate. We were up kind of low- to mid-single digits in both of those categories. Europe was a little bit slow only because we're so tight in capacity and that's why we're putting new capacity in UK. And in the food can business, we talked about the declines. When you really strip out the customer that we lost, we were flat year over year and actually up slightly in the first quarter while the overall market was down. But again, let's not forget that first quarter is a seasonally slow quarter. So as we look out to the balance of the year, nothing has changed appreciably relative to our volume expectations for the industry or our own business.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And just one more if I could on the pending merger with Rexam and the timeline uncertainty associated with that. Has that made any difference, John, as it relates to customer churn in any region geographically so far? Thanks so much.
John Hayes: No, Ghansham, no it has not. Our contracts are usually multiyear by nature. Most of them were concluded in the fall to early winter last year, so it was prior to the Rexam announcements. We see no changes.
Operator: We will proceed to our next question, it's from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners. Go ahead.
Chip Dillon: When you look at the free cash flow guide of the year, Scott, you mentioned it would be excluding cash costs of hedges, etc. or involved in the acquisition of Rexam. And I guess, if we assume it doesn't close this year can you give us a range of what those cash costs could be?
Scott Morrison: That's not related to the hedges. What I meant were the transaction costs, the cash transaction costs that we will have. And this year is kind of hard to handicap, but they could be upwards of $40 million this year.
John Hayes: And Chip, those have to do with legal fees, it has to do with commitment fees, accounting, financial advisor fees, things like that.
Scott Morrison: The bulk of the fees get paid on the closing of the transaction, so all of that kind of flushes through at once.
Chip Dillon: I see. But that $40 million could occur before closing and this year, if closing is next year.
Scott Morrison: That's correct.
Chip Dillon: Okay and then I might have missed this, but could you give us a breakdown of the volumes in the Americas beverage segment in the first quarter by North America, Latin America and Asia?
John Hayes: Yes, actually I think I just went through it, but I'm happy to do it real quickly again. In North America, overall market was down about 1%. We were down slightly more than that but it just had to do with geography and mix. There's nothing appreciably different there. In Brazil, the overall market is down a couple of percent, we were down a touch more than that mid- to upper-single digits. It largely had to do with our customer mix. We had a customer that wasn't performing as well relative to some others that we don't do business with. And then in the Asia business it was up nicely double digits decently and the overall market was up 17%. As I mentioned also, unfortunately, it didn't really contribute to much to the improved profitability because the pricing has been quite challenging there.
Chip Dillon: Got you. And then just as a last one, I know on the last call you mentioned expected tax rate around 26%. Now it's a little over 27%. Is that just related to currency and the impacts there or are there other factors going on?
Scott Morrison: No, it's more just kind of the mix of earnings where we're making the money. We're making little bit more money in higher tax rate jurisdictions.
Operator: We will take our next question from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Go ahead.
Philip Ng: Can you help frame the sensitivities in the metal premium to your EBIT and what is the lag I guess associated with the P&L? I would imagine you have some hedges. And at this point, if it stays flat, what is your expectation for aluminum premiums being a drag for 2015?
Scott Morrison: Well, it cost us $8 million in the first quarter. There really isn't a -- there really aren't hedges for this -- this is really European premium and there's just starting to be a market to be able to hedge those premiums but historically there has not been. So most of that -- it flows through and so it flows through timing wise more higher inventory will flow through. So there is about a quarter lag probably to seeing lower prices from the decline in the premium. So that's why we say in the first quarter we had a big it, it will moderate in the second quarter and then we should be able to -- we should offset that kind of the drag that we've had in the first half of the year in the second half if the premiums continue on the trend they've been on.
Philip Ng: And I understand Constellation is pushing can't aggressively for the Corona business. How much of that new Monterrey capacity you bring on is actually coming back in the U.S. rather than Mexico? And are you guys ultimately displacing glass or other beverage cans suppliers selling to other brewers? And how does that margin profile stack up relative to your other businesses?
John Hayes: I would rather not specifically comment on the customer names and other things, but we do expect a fair number of those cans, given what our customers do, will be an export from Mexico. And they have been building a very large, perhaps the largest brewery in the world and they've been doing quite well. And so, I think that should be helpful to us. I'm not sure I understood your question about margins. Were you talking about relative to glass and for that customer or--?
Philip Ng: No, just relative to the rest of your portfolio on the bev can side because you don't have a footprint in Mexico, at least based on my understanding.
John Hayes: No, but we're going to be servicing a lot of the quality and customer service out of our existing North American business. So just think about this as being a new plant and there's not tremendous amount of exist -- additional overhead built other than what would be at the plant level.
Philip Ng: Got you. But the margin profile then I guess would be comparable to what you're generating in North America? Is that good way to think about it?
John Hayes: Yes, said another way, it generates the economics returns that we look for.
Philip Ng: Okay. And just one last one for me, I guess for Scott. You know you are off to a slower start to the year and part of that is FX and somewhat off issues. What are some of the levers you guys are pulling to be able to hit that $600 million free cash flow number. Thanks.
Scott Morrison: Yes, the earnings are little bit softer, but we said coming into this year, it's really not that different from where we sat in February we did the call. We expect working capital to be another source of cash flow this year and we continue to believe that. So that's where it's coming from.
John Hayes: And let's not forget some of the earnings -- the earnings shortfall related to currency translation, that is a noneconomic -- that is not necessarily cash, that's just translation of earnings from, in this case, euros to dollars. So that doesn't necessarily have an appreciable impact on cash flow.
Operator: Now we go to our next question from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Just with Oss, should the startup costs start to move a fair amount lower as we head through the year?
Scott Morrison: Yes, we expect that. Oss is up and running producing cans now and you know there's a learning curve to that. And then for Lublin we're putting in another end module there and hired the people for that. And so that will move. But as you get through this -- kind of into the second half of the year a lot of those costs should dissipate or should reduce.
Tyler Langton: And then just in terms of productivity, obviously, that was a big help for Europe in 2014. Just looking for 2015, can you just share some thoughts on sort of productivity cost-out gains that you think you could get both in Europe and North America?
Scott Morrison: On the Europe side, they continue to make good progress on cost-out. It's a little bit of a mixed bag right now because you are ramping up costs to deal with the new line and the new end module. But if you take a step back from that they're still doing a good job of taking cost out. And North America is always on that plan of always maximizing, reducing costs. The performance in North America has been very solid because of that.
Tyler Langton: And then just with Asia, I think you said it was up double digits. Is that a lot just from timing? And then can that rate -- what sort of rate are you looking for, for the rest of the year? And then just given your capacity, can you continue to grow with the market?
John Hayes: You know, we're going to get a point where we've been -- the first quarter was a lot stronger than we thought and we're not investing in China because we don't think it could be the pricing environment is such that we could make the returns that would we would require as part of that. So I would expect the from an industry perspective we still see strong beverage can growth. I think it will moderate a little bit. As I said, we were helped by the Chinese New Year, the timing of Chinese New Year this year. The overall beer market is relatively flat China. But you are seeing very good can penetration growth rates and that's what's been driving it, particularly on the high-end of the beer category in China. But, as I said also, we're not going to be investing unless we can make economic returns. So, we're going to start to hit capacity utilization issues probably later on this year. And I certainly hope, although we have not seen it yet, that the supply-demand situation will tighten up to a point where pricing gets more moderated.
Operator: And we will turn to our next question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Scott, one more on the premiums. At current prices, you said you might get back in the second half what you expect to lose in the first half. Would you expect a reasonable benefit in the first half of next year as well, again at current prices?
Scott Morrison: It's a lot of assumptions in that question. So, yes, if prices stay lower it would be helpful in 2016.
Adam Josephson: By roughly the same amount that it would be a drag on the first half of this year roughly?
Scott Morrison: Yes, that's fair estimation.
Adam Josephson: Okay, just a couple of others. John and Scott, you talked about the growth projects, $200 million or so that you are spending on them. Is there any way to give us a rough sense as to the eventual benefits that you expect from those projects once they are fully ramped up?
John Hayes: Well, you know they're all different. But if you just say Ball is in EVA company and it expects to make at least 9% after-tax -- obviously, at the weight average, the tax rate, but call it 15% pretax on $200 million of capital. So that's what? $30 million of EBIT and that's probably a minimum benchmark that we would look towards.
Adam Josephson: And just one on the proposed transaction with Rexam. Assuming it closes is with limited divestitures, can you give us a rough sense as to what your currency exposures would be, euro, ruble, etcetera, as a total company?
Scott Morrison: It would move this is a total company to probably 50% U.S. dollar, 50% rest of the world currencies with the rest of the world currencies a big chart -- the vast majority is euro. Rubles and things like that are really small. Right now, for Rexam, I think there about 5% of revenues so on a combined business it's 2% or 3%; sterling kind of the same thing, 2% or 3%. So the vast majority is euro and dollar.
Operator: And we will move to our next question from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.
Chris Manuel: Just a couple of questions for you, first on some stuff on Monterrey and then the second on aluminum premium. But with respect to Monterrey, will both lines be on stream in 2016 or is that staggered one line 2016, one coming after? And are you shipping to that customer today from facilities in North America or is this all incremental volume to you?
John Hayes: First, both lines will not be coming up at the same time, but they will be -- we're putting them in at the same time. One will start up and then shortly thereafter, probably a quarter, maybe two quarters beyond that, the second line will start up. And then with your other question, yes, we currently are shipping certainly not near the level that we will be manufacturing. But as they start to ramp up, we're seeding volume for them.
Chris Manuel: And then with the aluminum premium question, Scott, can you maybe give us a sense of -- this it's kind of a follow-up to Adam's question. But absent -- it sounds like this year is going to end up being somewhat neutral without the first half benefit in the second half. Maybe if you think of it cumulative, the last two, three, four years, how much of a hit that you haven't recovered do you feel you've had to endure, specifically to aluminum premium?
Scott Morrison: Let's say even if we were recover what we gave up -- what we give up in the first half of the year in the second half of the year, that premium is still at an elevated level what it was back in 2013.
Chris Manuel: Yes.
Scott Morrison: And so the premium appears to be heading back to kind of that 2013 level or below. So I would say this more upside to that. How much, I'm not going to predict at this point.
Chris Manuel: No, that's not what I'm trying to get at. I guess what I'm trying to understand is if you -- how much of a hit did you have in 2014? How much was the hit in 2013, etcetera, that you're still technically or not technically but cumulatively behind?
Scott Morrison: It's still going to be north in 2014. I think we've said it's going to be €15 million.
Chris Manuel: Right.
Scott Morrison: In 2013, it was €8 million and that was off of the 2012 number, right? So I think there's more to go.
Operator: We will get to our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank. Go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Just a follow-up on the last question. With premium last year, there was a lot of talk about the need to fix contracts in Europe past along the premium and now I guess those calls have died down. Regardless of where the premium is week to week, is it a long term priority to get contracts in Europe more in line with North America so that you can pass along premium or are you thinking that this as kind of a big issue that seems like it may be resolved or is not going to be a long term problem as you look out to the rest of the year in 2016 and 2017?
John Hayes: I was going to say I think strategically we're not in the business to be taking risks that are not in our control. And so this is something that for many, many years the European premium really didn't move at all. So it was never viewed as a risk. I think starting in 2013, we started to identify it. We have been trying to take the necessary actions to derisk our business, but we work in a very competitive environment. And so, you can do certain things with certain customers if they agree to and if they have alternatives, you're not able to do those types of things. So it is our strategic intent to reduce the risk of things we can't control in our business. That may be a bit cryptic but that's another way of saying we're trying to work with our customers on this.
Scott Morrison: I would say the one addition to that, the difference now versus where we sat a year ago or two years ago is there is a developing market to be able to hedge that premium. And so when you enter into contracts going forward, while it is still a relatively new market it appears that you'll have an ability to hedge that premium. So, I would agree with all of John's comments. The new fact is the ability to hedge it potentially which can also reduce that volatility.
Anthony Pettinari: And then just switching to Americas. In North America, on the specialties side you had a competitor that faced some margin compression in specialties last year. As you look at your specialty business in the Americas, understanding volumes appear to be fairly strong, would you describe your margins in specialties as stable? Are they up or down? And then you talked about an acquisition of a small easy-open end business, I think in Ohio. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of color on that.
John Hayes: First with respect to specialty margins, we see no appreciable change to where our margins are. I think what you're referring to is from a competitor. That was on a specific size that while we participate in it, isn't a huge part of our portfolio and I think it was isolated to a competitive situation on that size. With respect to the acquisition of the Sunoco Phoenix EZO end facilities, yes, we're quite excited about that. We didn't talk too much about it but it's a -- we brokered from EZO ends from the Sunoco Phoenix business for many, many years and, as the market continues to decide whether it's -- one year they're going strong in the EZO, the next year it is out. We thought it was a good value for us to get into that business. At the end of the day the profitability of it isn't material to our Corporation and we didn't disclose it. It's nice but it's not material. So I don't think you'll see a huge change in that, but it does provide a capability that we were lacking in terms of our customer needs.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead.
Mark Wilde: On the Rexam call they mentioned that the German market seems to be picking up. Are you guys seeing much evidence of that?
John Hayes: Yes, we're. The overall German market in the first quarter was up, I think, around 15% or so largely driven by -- we've talked for years that the big breakthrough for Germany with likely be once the big discounters, all the [indiscernible] start to list cans and it was in the first quarter that both entities started listing it. So that's exciting. I think as we look forward you should expect the German market to continue to grow. How quickly and whether or not it gets back to that 6 billion to 7 billion units it once was, it's premature to say that. But the key to it was getting distribution of cans throughout Germany and now that's in place.
Mark Wilde: And so John, right now, just to size, that market would be somewhere between 3.5 billion and 4 billion is that about right?
John Hayes: I think it's less than that. And again, you have to parse out what is consumed in Germany versus what is exported from Germany. And I think the consumed in Germany is much closer to about over between 1.5 billion and 2 billion units. Probably closer to 2 billion units. And then there's another billion or so, if not a little bit more, that are exported, filled and exported from Germany. What I was referring to really was the consumption in Germany.
Mark Wilde: Yes, okay. The other question I had is just going back to the third-quarter call. It sounded like you thought you would be getting some news on aerospace contracts somewhere around year-end. And it seems like out here at the end of April there's been some delay in some of those contracts being granted. Can you just update us?
John Hayes: Yes, you know there is really no update. We still have a tremendous amount of opportunities we're chasing. The backlog did go down a little bit, but nothing has changed in terms of the balance of 2015. I've long since abdicated the ability to predict when the timing of some of these things will happen, but I think the opportunities that longer term hasn't changed at all.
Operator: And we will get to our next question from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. Go ahead.
Al Kabili: Scott, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on the hedges related to the proposed Rexam acquisition. Is there a specific sterling-U.S. dollar rate that you locked in with the hedges for the cash portion or maybe some sensitivities around exchange rate fluctuations there? Thanks.
Scott Morrison: There will be some color on it in the Q, but we really did most of this through various types of collar structures. So there's a range of rates. So there really isn't just one rate. And it was really to ensure that the economics on pretty close to the day we agreed to the deal that that's the economics that we'll end up with when we close the deal. So there really isn't just one rate that you can peg. But it will give a range in the Q as to what that range might be.
Al Kabili: Okay, all right, we'll look for that. And then also just on the bridging the decline in the Europe beverage earnings EBIT. Was there anything else besides the FX metal premiums and start-up costs that had weighed on first quarter results? Because by my math, excluding the cost you laid out, there was still may be of $5 million gap down year over year there.
John Hayes: A lot of it was timing is what I would say. Recall that on the February 5 call and maybe even the call back in October, we talked about pricing in Europe was a little bit more challenging than what we would've liked and so there was little bit of pricing, not huge, but a little bit. So I wouldn't read too much into that. As Scott had said in his prepared remarks, we expect for the full-year 2015 on a constant currency basis that our profitability would be up in that segment.
Scott Morrison: Let me clarify on the math. It was down $26 million, $13 million of that was currency, $8 million of that was metal premium and $3 million was startup cost. So I get to $2 million. So the $2 million that John is talking about and maybe a little absorption is the $2 million.
John Hayes: Yes.
Al Kabili: And then related to that is just your share in Europe, did you see any appreciable change there? I know you had kind of underperformed the market a little bit. One of your peers outperformed significantly. I know there is some geographic differences and customer differences there. But how do you feel your share in Europe is tracking this year?
John Hayes: I think we expect to the full-year -- you really can't take the first quarter and extrapolate out because it's the seasonally slowest quarter. We lost a little bit of share in the first quarter, but it really just had to do with exactly what you said. It depends upon geography and where the weather is warm and where the weather is cold. Our soft drink was a little bit stronger than we expected and our beer was little bit weaker than we expected and it had to do with the various geographies. We were a little bit softer in the UK than the overall market, but that just had to do with the customer mix we had there. We were, as we talked about, strong in Germany. In France, it was a little bit weaker but that had to do was soft drinks. So I wouldn't read too much into it.
Al Kabili: And then final question I guess, John, to the degree you can in this type of forum comment, but just in terms of the customer reaction to the proposed Rexam acquisition how you're feeling, if there's been any surprises there. Thanks.
John Hayes: Well, you know we did talk about this. On the February 19 call people had asked had we talked to customers at that time and the answer was no because we hadn't announced a transaction. We've been very actively engaged with our customers, not only as part of the regulatory approval process but it's an opportunity to really articulate what the benefits to the customer are to them in terms of broadening the geographic footprint, leveraging the innovation, ensuring the can is the most competitive from a cost point of view, sustainability, all those various things.  And so when you ask is if there's surprises relative to the customer discussions we've been having, the short answer is no only because we had discussions with our customers about all those things in the past, broadening the footprint, sustainability, making sure we're as cost competitive as possible and leveraging our innovation.
Operator: And we will turn to our question which is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
Debbie Jones: I wanted to talk a little bit about specialty cans. You mentioned this earlier. I'm just wondering how far do you think this trend can go maybe by region. I know Anthony asked about pricing, but this investment in general kind of generate the same return for you as it did maybe 3 to 5 years ago?
John Hayes: Well, you know people always try and categorize it as 12-ounce -- in North America, 12 ounce and specialty. And specialty is 20 plus different sizes. It's so we have to be careful when we describe it. And there's also maturity curves on each and every one size as time goes on. What we're trying to do and have been successful in doing so far is to continue to be out front relative to different can sizes whether it's heights, whether it's diameters, whether it's the amount of product that goes in the container. So, let's be careful when we talk about specialty. But specialty continues to grow. And just to get -- on the February 5 call, we said in 2014 it's reached about 28% of our portfolio. By my math in the first quarter it was 30% of our portfolio. We saw good growth in North America. We saw good growth in Europe. We saw very good growth off a very low base in Asia. We didn't have the growth in Brazil only because our volumes were down. But what we've been seeing is here in North America, for example, we've been relatively flat over the last 18 if not a couple of years because the standard 12-ounce, largely in the soft drink segment, have been declining kind of mid-single digits and specialty has been growing double digits. And you combine those two on a weighted average basis and you get relatively flat. Answering your question about the returns of new investments relative to 3 to 5 years ago, the biggest difference is that specialty is becoming of a size now that we're dedicating lines to specialty formats, where in the past our investments were much smaller because it was converting 12-ounce lines to specialty containers. And any time you have a conversion the returns are probably a little bit better there because you're not putting in bricks and mortar and other things like that. But having said that, the investments we're making and specialty in terms of new capacity in bricks and mortar, we're still satisfied what the returns there.
Debbie Jones: And my final question, just could you just comment on pricing in China whether you're going to be more or less optimistic about the strategy going forward?
Scott Morrison: I'm not that optimistic in the near-term because I think there's still a lot of capacity. So I think the pressure is going to continue to be on. So, we're doing everything in our power to take out costs and become more efficient to be able to perform.
Operator: We will turn to next question from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.
Alex Ovshey: Can you provide some color on the Mexico bev can market? What is the size of the market before you put in your capacity? What have the historical growth rates been? What's the mix between can and glass?
John Hayes: Well, why don't I take a first crack at that. It's important to point out that -- someone asked this question earlier, a fair amount the majority of the cans that we will be making in Mexico we expect to be exported to other markets outside of Mexico. And so while your question is relevant, it may be less relevant relative to this investment. But the overall can market, I forget off the top of my head the exact size of it. I think it's about $11 billion or so. It's been growing 3% to 5% and the can mix, again beer versus soft drink, we're seeing the same thing down in Mexico terms of beer that we've been seeing around the world where there's been a trend towards cans relative to glass. I think it's around 30% or so right now and that's been up from 20% probably a few years ago. On the soft drink side, it's still largely a PET business, although the can penetration is kind of probably in and around 10% which we see in many other parts of the world.
Alex Ovshey: And then just on the aluminum premium, a lot of people asked a number of questions around it, but maybe to sum up what I heard -- you said it was about an €8 million headwind in 2013 about a €15 million headwind in 2014 and then this year if all goes to plan, it's sort of a wash? So entering 2016, is it fair to say that sort of the unrecovered number in aluminum premium is about €23 million? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?
Scott Morrison: I'm not going to predict what's going to happen in 2016, but I don't -- you know, your math is correct.
John Hayes: It really has to do with at the end of the day what the metal premium level is. And it spiked to a record high in the first quarter. It's been coming down. Where it settles and where, as Scott said, with the ability going forward to be able to hedge how we do that and how we neutralize it, it's premature to speculate. But as Scott said, your math is correct.
Alex Ovshey: Okay. If I could just ask one more on working capital, would you be able to tell us a range that you expect the working capital number to benefit cash flow in 2015? And then maybe thinking beyond this year, what are the metrics on working capital that we as outsiders should be looking out to be able to say whether or not there is for the runway for working capital improvements beyond this year?
Scott Morrison: Sure, I think that getting to a number, I think the working capital benefit this year will be a little greater than it was last year. A lot of that has to do with improvements that we're making -- I am sorry, it would be a little less than it was last year. I apologize. But a lot of the improvements that we're making have to do with systems that allow us to manage inventories better. The businesses have done a fantastic job of reducing inventories. There is also things that have gone on the receivable side and the payable side, but a lot of it has to do with inventory and the investments we've been making. And so, how much more of that we can get, I don't know. Each year we seem to be able to come up with sources over the last number of years. At some point, you kind of have to hold serve and that won't continue. But at least for '15, we see a good source from a working capital standpoint.
Operator: And we do have another question in queue, it's a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
George Staphos: Guys, the question I had for you is in terms of all the activity that you have going on, if you had to respond to a new customer request for facility, not sure that you actually want to in 2015 in 2016, but do you have the resources that if you did have an award that you could actually start working on it with everything else that you have going on? I had a related question.
John Hayes: That's a fair question, George, because we do have a wide variety of different projects going on. One of the benefits that we have right now, though, they are distributed. We have a couple of things -- in Conroe, Texas and in Mexico that the North American guys and girls are covering off. In Europe, we've got Oss and we've got Lublin. In the food and household products side, we have on the tinplate in Chestnut Hill; we've got a couple over in Europe with respect to the UK and India and then over in Asia, we've got Myanmar. So as you see the different management teams, local management teams are not individually overloaded with any of that. If we went forward and there were three new projects, had good return projects in Asia, it would be a stretch for us and I'm not sure -- we would have to prioritize that. We don't see that right now, though. And so if that were to come, we would just have to evaluate it relative to the resources we have, but it's a fair question that we think about a lot. Are we making sure it's distributed enough that we're not taxing our people too much?
Scott Morrison: George, if you have some leads for us though, we're ready to pursue them.
George Staphos: I'll let you know. We'll talk off-line about the royalty. But all kidding aside, the related follow-ons would be if you had a need, hopefully there won't be -- but let's say there was a market dislocation, a weak summer, something of that ilk where you then needed to have another discrete cost-out program above and beyond your normal cost reduction program, do you have again the resources to attack something like that if need be? Similar question, I'm assuming that as you were planning all of these projects and other strategic initiatives you were doing it with an understanding of what your various contract renewals would need to be or look like. Do you have any significant, specifically in beverage cans but anywhere you'd like to talk be helpful, contract renewals that we should be mindful 2016 and 2017? If you can update or remind us on that, that would be great. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: George, this is John, I'll take the first question about, if we had to go cost out. We do this all the time. One of the things we don't talk a lot about is over the last 18, 15 months we've been moving towards a shared service model in terms of the back office efficiencies and we've had a little bit of upfront costs getting that up and running. But we expect as we look out the next 24, 36 months that we're going to see a tremendous amount of efficiencies. Everything from how we pay payroll, for example, to how we administer our benefits, how we invoice our customers. There's a whole bunch of activities on a regional basis but even a global basis on standing various projects up and offices up. And then the next step is being able to take those costs out of the local plants or the local regions where they're inefficient. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity and we're actually chomping at the bit to get after some of that. So we're going to be accelerating. That is what we do each and every day. We're well incentivized to try and take out as much costs as quickly as possible relative to servicing our customers and so that's what we're going to be doing. If you talk about footprint, we have no plans on the table right now in terms of looking at our footprint because in most of the geographies, if not all the geographies we operate, we're very tight from a capacity point of view. And so I would not anticipate we would do that. The last question I think was about customers and renewals. As I'm thinking and I look to Scott as well, I can't think of anything that is abnormal that we have a significant amounts of business up for renewal. North America just by definition the size of our contracts are large but there's nothing that stands out. We've renewed customer contracts over the past couple of years. They are typically always multiyear contracts. In Europe, we might have a little here and there, but again it's much -- the size of those contracts are much more distributed and smaller. And then in China, we do have a contract that's up for renewal at the end of this year that's probably one of our largest if not our largest over there. So we're very focused on that. Those are the only things that come into my mind.
Operator: Thank you very much. And Mr. Hayes, we have no further questions on the line. I'll turn it back to you.
John Hayes: Okay, great. Thank you, Tommy. We appreciate everyone's support and we'll be in touch in the second quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to disconnect your lines. Have a good day everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 5, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Rebecca. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Before I begin and as you've all seen earlier today, we issued a statement confirming that we are in discussions that may lead to an acquisition of Rexam PLC. The announcement was made following a statement made by Rexam consistent with its obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code, which regulates any such transaction. Consistent with our policy and the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will not be making any further comment or responding to any questions on that topic during this call. I would ask you to please respect the U.K. Takeover panel and its rules. Rest assured for any investment that Ball contemplates, we will do it through the lens of our disciplined capital allocation process. Now the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available in our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for 2015. 2014 as a whole was an outstanding year for Ball. Together, we executed well through some adversity early in the year and have been focused on positioning our company for success now and in the future as we navigate the dynamic, economic and competitive landscape. During the year, we grew comparable diluted earnings per share by 18%. We achieved record free cash flow in excess of $620 million and we increased EVA dollars by 28%. Operationally and strategically, we are also well positioned. The cost-out program we initiated 18 months ago in our European beverage can segment has met expectations and positions us well for the future. Our investments in specialty containers in North America, Brazil and in Europe had allowed us to participate in a meaningful way in a key growth segment of the beverage can world, and specialty cans now represent over 28% of our mix on a global basis. Our impact-extruded aerosol investments continue to do well and allow us to participate in another growth segment of the metal packaging world. The Aerospace team delivered multiple affordable technology solutions to our customers, generating record results for the segment. And as One Ball, we achieved recognition for our focus on sustainability and received supplier and/or customer awards in each of our businesses during 2014. As we move into 2015, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and on ramping up numerous capital projects on-time and on budget. We will maximize the value of what we currently do while making investments in new geographies, new products, new customers and new segments to help grow our company. We have a number of new opportunities that are at various levels of investment, whether it be the next-generation aluminum bottle shaping technology in North America for a customer under a long-term arrangement that will begin at the end of the first quarter, a new tin plate aerosol can manufacturing technology that will begin during the second quarter, the new Oss, Netherlands line that will start up during the second quarter, the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar that is scheduled to begin early 2016, the construction of a new aluminum impact-extruded aerosol facility in India, or chasing several billion dollars of outstanding commercial and governmental opportunities in our Aerospace business. We have a good runway as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months. Now sometimes you are the victim of your own success, and we have created some challenging comps for ourselves during 2015, particularly in the first half, which Scott will discuss later. However, we feel confident that despite these headwinds of lower food can volumes, or Asian pricing, of foreign exchange volatility, we are well positioned for the long term. Life at Ball and our EVA philosophy is about continuous improvement, so we are happy to take on the challenge. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for 2014 were $3.88 versus last year's $3.28, an 18% increase. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.84 versus $0.86, including unfavorable currency translation of $0.02. For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: Growth in global specialty cans, record earnings in Aerospace, lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. Turning to cash flow. Ball generated in excess of $1 billion in cash from operations and generated $622 million in free cash flow in 2014. We also acquired a net $360 million of stock and returned another $73 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. In total, the cash return to shareholders was below our prior guidance, driven by lower than expected share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Some of what will likely be a question during Q&A, sometimes there are limitations as to when you can and cannot buy shares and the fourth quarter fell into the bucket when we couldn't buy shares. Rest assured that our philosophy of returning value to shareholders has not changed. And at this time, barring additional opportunities for capital allocation in 2015, our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the full year 2015, as we sit here today, here's our initial take on financial metrics. Free cash flow will be in the range of $600 million, CapEx should be in the range of $400 million, if project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be roughly $145 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26% and 2015 corporate undistributed will be approximately $80 million. Due to our strong 2014 free cash flow and additional funding at year-end, minimal cash pension contributions are required in 2015. Though as with everyone these days, we will be impacted by roughly $7 million of higher global pension expense in 2015, due to factors including lower discount rates and updated mortality assumptions. Net balance sheet debt at year end was approximately $3 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.7x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x. Our current committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2014 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and details regarding the fourth quarter $45 million pretax non-cash charge for settlement of certain pension obligations, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Now moving to operations. Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings for full year 2014 were up $22 million on double-digit specialty growth, the first half benefit of the World Cup and excellent operating performance in the North American beverage container operations. As we commented in the earnings release, fourth quarter 2014 was impacted by muted volume trends in China and the startup cost associated with ramping up our next-generation aluminum bottle shaping project in our Conroe, Texas facility. The stark reality in China is that can pricing has suffered yet another blow and this has created difficult market conditions. We will focus our energy on leveraging every single cost-containment and process improvement we can to further improve our cost base and get the most out of our existing asset base in the most effective way. The team there is working very hard and has the full support of the global beverage team to pull it through. The Americas-Asia segment as a whole will be solid in 2015 due to better absorption in our legacy North American and Brazilian facilities, and the conclusion of start-up costs related to the aluminum bottle project coming online during the second quarter. European beverage comparable earnings were down $10 million in the fourth quarter and low single-digit volume declines, higher year-over-year aluminum premium headwinds and the impact of unfavorable earnings translation. Full year 2014 results improved roughly $40 million, with volumes up almost 3%, and cost initiatives -- cost-containment initiatives taking hold. Good work by all of the Ball Europe team. Tough year-over-year comps in the first half of 2015 to do FX translation, aluminum premiums and the Oss startup cost should be factored into your full year 2015 expectations for this division. On a constant-currency basis, we expect European beverage will increase operating earnings in 2015 as the third line in Oss starts up mid-second quarter. Food and household comparable segment earnings were only off a bit in the quarter as segment volumes were stable and manufacturing inefficiencies in our U.S. metal service center lessened compared to prior quarters, which impacted full year 2014 by roughly $15 million. Our global extruded aluminum product line continues to perform at a high level, and buys in Europe have held up well, given economic conditions. As the Food and Household segment enters 2015, steel operations have been right sized for its current book of business and will focus on improving manufacturing performance, ramping up the next-generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology to be launched commercially mid-2015 and further growing the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe and India. There will be some quarter-over-quarter noise in this segment related to the customer shift, which transitioned on January 1, 2015, but this has been known since late 2013. In summary, our global beverage packaging operating teams continue to execute projects that will improve our business in North America and Europe in the second half of 2015, while also identifying additional cost efficient, high returning growth opportunities to benefit Ball in 2016 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great, thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace exceeded business expectations, really an amazing accomplishment considering government budgets in the recent election cycle. During the quarter, solid program execution continued and much work was completed to bid on additional work. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $765 million, an anticipated reduction year-over-year as we await word on program bids that are in process. Our capabilities and products are well positioned as affordable solutions. We just need some decisions, and the right decisions at that, to be made in Washington. Now looking out across our company today, we are thankful for the team we have, the incredible results we've produced last year and the progress we are making on new capital being put to work. 2015 presents some known headwinds other companies are dealing with as well: FX, pension expense and aluminum premiums to name a couple. We are excited about the many opportunities in front of us to improve our business. Our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15% is out of reach for 2015 as we sit here today. We currently expect the earnings run rate to pick up steam in the back half of 2015 as projects ramp up and carry us onto the bridge for building into 2016. In the near term, our businesses are generating significant free cash flow for us to put to work. So let's start the Q&A so Scott and I can get back at it. And with that, Rebecca, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess the first question I had for you, can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of what's happening with Asian pricing, I'm guessing specifically Chinese pricing, what kind of impact it is. Can you also comment as to what FX headwind from an EBIT standpoint or from an earnings per share standpoint is built into your directional guidance, and I had a couple of follow ons.
Scott C. Morrison: Sure, George. This is Scott. On the Asian pricing, it continues to be very challenging and we thought last year it might have been a new low, but I think it continues to have pressure on it. I'm not going to quantify it because it's a pretty fluid situation. But it's obviously impactful. I think the other parts of that segment will do well and make more money, and it's a question of can they offset what the -- the pressure that we'll have in China. So on the second front, on the FX side, if the euro -- if you think about it this way from an EPS standpoint, roughly a 1 point move in the euro is about $0.01 a share, roughly.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. Thank you for that. To the extent that you can comment, could you put a range on what you think your EVA per share might grow by this year or -- no, maybe not, I mean, I shouldn't be too judgmental here, but what's the direction this year on EVA per share. Could you put a bracket in terms of the growth rate? And then, I guess I'll turn it over at that point and come back in queue.
John A. Hayes: George, this is John. From an EVA perspective, we were up very strong in 2014, up 28%. It's going to be a bit of a challenge. We have a lot of investment going in, it's not generating any return right now because it's in the startup mode, so I would expect our EVA dollars to be roughly flat, maybe down a little bit depending on how the year goes. But -- and that's largely due to this capital we are putting out -- a lot of it doesn't come on until midstream and when it is coming on, we've got some start-up cost associated with it.
Scott C. Morrison: I would expect EVA dollars, George, they're going to be up in North American beverage, it's going to be up in Brazil and it's been a be up in Europe. The other businesses will be flat to slightly down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just following up on China for a minute. Scott, I think you also mentioned that volumes were actually muted in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about that, and then can you also talk about, from the pricing front, I thought some of your business there was on a little bit longer term contract. Can you talk about what's more spot versus longer-term contract there?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. Our volumes grew kind of low single digits in the fourth quarter, and I think everything in China seems like it's slowing down a bit. So I don't think that was uncommon. We had been at a better growth rate throughout most of the year. From a pricing perspective, that's why it's kind of a mixed bag. There are some contracts that have longer-term nature to them, but there is a lot of spot business, and that's what I was referring to.
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think the main dynamic there, Scott, is there -- we continue to see capital going in, and it's just the -- it, the overcapacity remains there, and I think so that means on a spot pricing perspective, that's where it puts the most pressure on it.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then taking a step back and looking at the broader beverage can business, can you talk about what you're seeing from your customers as far as global pricing initiative, if you've seen this in your markets, how long you've seen it for, and maybe, sort of what impact do you think it might have on margins on a go-forward basis?
John A. Hayes: When you talk about global pricing, you're talking about our product to our customer, I presume. There is -- we have a mixed bag around the world, regional, global. We don't -- as Scott said, we expect many of our beverage can segments, with the exception of China, to be up year-over-year. And so we're -- some of that's a function of volume, some of it's a function of net price, some of it's a function of our mix. So I think we feel pretty good right now. The beverage can as an industry is actually doing quite well, relative to other substrates. You've heard me talk in the past about Kansas as a percent of the package mix in the beer category, and I think in every region we operate, it's up. It's over 60% U.S., it's over -- it's around 45% in Brazil. It's north of 20% in whole in Europe, obviously it's a little bit stronger in the U.K., for example, relative to some other places. And then even in China, we've talked about 5%, 6%, 7% as a share of the package, makes it up to 10% now. The fourth quarter was soft, I think the industry was down, we were up a little bit. But putting that aside, as we go into 2014, we continue to believe the beverage can has a bright future.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And just one last one on working capital and the free cash flow guidance. Looks like you've built, or used a significant amount of cash, or sorry, you had a big source of cash in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2014. What should we be thinking about in 2015 around working capital?
Scott C. Morrison: We think it's going to be a source again. We continue to -- our folks both from a treasury perspective and an operations perspective, continue to find ways to get more money out of the working capital, so I think it's going to be another source in 2015 as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I guess I'll skip the question on what your acquisition pipeline looks like, but good luck with what you [indiscernible] this morning with Rexam. Maybe we can start on the volume outlook by region for your beverage can business for '15, and maybe you could start off with Brazil, just given the comp set the industry had in the first half of '15 from the World Cup?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think obviously, that leads tougher comps for Brazil, definitely. We think there'll be market growth, but we think it's going to be pretty low. The economy there has got some struggles, and we'll have to wait and see how it plays out, but we're not expecting -- we expect it to be positive, but not in the huge way. North America, we kind of return to more normalized trends, I would say, last year and we expect that to continue. The soft drink business continues to be under pressure, but beer continues to hold up pretty well, and a lot of new segments continue to hold up well, and specialty is doing well. So probably somewhere in '15 as it was in '14 for us. Europe, we think the market will grow again. Kind of low to mid-single digits. You know what it's been growing over the last year or so. And China, China's slowed down from where it was before, and I still think it'll grow, but the question is how much.
Scott C. Morrison: The other thing I'd add, Ghansham, is this last summer in particular, we had World Cup, we had other things going on. This summer, as we look forward, there's not many of those either European championships or World Cup or Olympics or other things like that. And so, it's an off year relative to those big promotional types of things, and so that's factored into what Scott just says.
John A. Hayes: And last year, I mean, for instance in Europe, the comp in the first quarter was up quite a bit, and we don't expect that again.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then, just in terms of what you said in your press release, I'm sorry if I missed it, but the lower exports you said, that's out of Europe, can you just expand on that?
John A. Hayes: Yes. That's really Middle East and Africa, and I think in part because of some of the geopolitical issues going on there. The export market for us, at least, was down, particularly in the fourth quarter. I think our core European volumes are actually up slightly. It's just the whole segment was down because the export market was down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: When you look at the free cash flow guidance for 2016, which is actually quite impressive, because on my numbers, the working capital contributed $171 million last year. Can you help us get there? First of all, on the pension, you said no contribution in '15. What was it in '14?
Scott C. Morrison: I would just do it this way, I'll look that up with the -- from an expense standpoint, the expense will be up about $7 million, but the funding for '15 will be less than $30 million.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, less than $30 million?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. We funded a lot in '14.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. How much in '14 did you fund?
John A. Hayes: Well, Scott's speaking, I think it's fair to say, in the U.S. we don't expect, hardly any, if any, funding. I think a lot of the European, particularly our German pension, is more of a pay-as-you-go, and so that's where that funding would come from.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And maybe I missed this, but when you look at 2015 volume in the U.S., how would -- and you say some more -- if you look at it on a more normal basis, does that mean that, on a net basis, you see maybe a little bit of growth as the standard cans probably overall decline, but most of that's from soft drink, with some beer offset? And then specialty also will more than offset the soft drink decline, so that you do see a positive can number including specialties in the U.S.? Or is that too strong?
John A. Hayes: Let me preference this by saying it's the beginning of February, and so tell me what the weather's going to be like, tell me what some other things are going to be, even with the price of gasoline coming down, you really haven't seen a pull through from the average consumer. They've been trade -- they aren't buying more, they're trading up a little bit and they're not buying more. But I think what Scott was talking about, when you look at 2014 and the U.S., the overall beverage can market was down less than a percent, it was down 0.07%. Euro was up, and we see those trends continuing, whether it's the craft beer or whether some of these other segments that are growing has been beneficial with can as the can continues to take share from other packaging substrates. And it's really all past few years, it really has been the softness in the soft drink. It's not as if the can has been losing market share relative to PET and other substrates, it's just overall soft drink volumes are declining and, to date, our customers haven't been able to arrest those declines. So as we look into 2015, we don't see those trends changing materially. Scott did mention that some of these other alternative segments, whether it's energy drinks or sparkling waters or other things like that, that there has been some decent growth in that, and a fair amount of specialty goes into things like that. So I don't think the core trends, we see a fundamental change to as we look forward the next 12 months or so.
Scott C. Morrison: Back to your pension question. We funded a little over $140 million in '14, in the pensions.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Very helpful. And that definitely helps us to -- that $600 million makes a lot more sense now. And then, when you look at the food can business, first of all, I think John mentioned some $15 million issue and maybe just to clarify what that was in '14. But if I hear you right, you're saying that with the work you've done to mitigate some of the changes plus the growth, you should -- you would expect to see an up second half and maybe a chance of at least a flat full year on the EBIT line there. So if you could address those 2 points?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think a flat EBIT year for the full year is a very tall order. We had -- the $15 million I referred to was manufacturing inefficiencies on the, particularly on the service center side. We've made some decent improvement on that, but that's a longer runway than I think you may be expecting. And then with the -- just the overall market continuing decline, continued with the loss of the ConAgra business. I think a year ago or so, we thought we might have a shot at being flat EBIT in 2015 in that segment. I think it's a bit challenging. And that's on the food side. There's a lot of good things going on, on the impact-extruded side, as well as this new technology on the tin plate aerosol side. So you see a blend of it, but I still think with all those, because of the start up costs on the India project, because of the startup cost related to the G3, I think it's a tall order to think about -- we'd be flat in that segment.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just Europe, the sort of the drop in year-over-year profits. Could you just provide a little color about, I guess, what kind of came from sort of the lower volume premiums, I guess, currency? And then maybe what, I guess, was offset by cost reductions?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. The cost reduction continues to -- they've really done a nice job of getting the cost out. It was really premium. We've got a little bit more headwind, about $7 million in the fourth quarter of euro headwind with the lower volume, and then FX that's kind of a total difference of why it was down. Why have a little bit more premium that will come through in the first half of '15, and then we'll be at more even comps, year-over-year.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When you think of cost reductions, I guess, for Europe, for this year for 2015, I mean, can you kind of match what you did in 2014, or is that going to start getting tougher?
Scott C. Morrison: No, it's -- I mean the guys did a really good job in '14. A lot of cost came out in '14. I think there's still -- they have a lot of aggressive plans continuing for '15, but I wouldn't expect it to be at the same level than it was in '14.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just, I guess comp question for food can. I mean, the sort of the improvement this quarter, just for the service inefficiencies, I mean, were those largely down this quarter, or were they still having an impact?
John A. Hayes: Well, it still has an impact. As I said, the runway of it's a bit longer, and I recall last summer we talked more specifically about it. Some of it was self-inflicted, that we weren't running as efficiently as we could or should be, and some of it was outside of our control in terms of quality issues with some of the tin plate. I think the quality's gotten better. I think our manufacturing efficiencies have improved as well. But again, I think you're -- we're going to see steady improvement throughout the year, and so it's not just a big bang theory that it happens, starts and stops in one period.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Can you kind of help frame what the headwind will be on a year-over-year basis for metal premiums in 2015?
John A. Hayes: We have a little bit more of it, probably in about another $7 million to $10 million in the first half of '15, and then we get to the second half, where we'll get some more even comps.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And just curious, I know a portion of your business resets every year in Europe. Were you able to pass some of those headwinds, cost headwinds through via pricing this year?
John A. Hayes: I think the best way to describe it, Scott had mentioned, on a currency-neutral basis, on a euro basis, our segment, we expect to be up year-over-year. Some of it's cost, some of it -- someone mentioned earlier about pricing and it's been a bit difficult, but on the other hand, we've been able to take this time. We're limited to be able to try and recover the premium and other costs as well.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: There's been a clear bifurcation in how demand is tracking, at least for beer in North America, bev cans versus glass. How much of that is driven by the push into specialty cans versus the brewers just trying to push volume through the grocery channel, and do you see that dynamic kind of continuing into 2015?
John A. Hayes: I really don't think it's pushing volume through the grocery channel. When you look at the beer market, it was relatively flat, for example, in the fourth quarter and it was relatively flat for the full year. The only thing that was really growing in a material level was this -- the craft beer industry. And that was predominantly, as you know, 100% bottle business. And now it's over, I think it's 12% plus or minus, don't hold me to it, but it's in that range as the cans as a share. And so cans are getting an inordinate share of that. And that's one of the reasons why, even though the beer market is relatively flat, I think cans are performing quite well.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got you. One of your competitors on the food can side in North America announced they're going to be adding a plant in the Midwest, it doesn't sound like it's going to be incremental from a capacity standpoint. But just curious, do you anticipate any impact from that move, and can you remind us what percentage of your business in North America, food is locked up from a contractual standpoint, the next few years?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I don't have that last question first, but the vast majority of it is. I know we have a couple of contracts outstanding, but no, the answer to your question is, we are aware that they announced in their earnings that they're going to be rationalizing and building at the same time, and we don't expect any appreciable change to the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Market.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I know you don't want to get in front of your customers here, but I wondered if you could give us just any color, incremental color on that new bottle. Is it a conversion of an existing line, is it a new line, any sense of kind of perspective volume there, incremental volume for you guys?
John A. Hayes: I will tell you, it's a new line, it's new capacity, and it's -- and we'd rather not go into the specifics about the customer or the segment, but we're excited about this. It's a new, a next-generation bottle shaping technology and it fits right into the sweet spot of our drive for 10 vision around expanding our new product portfolio.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And is it proprietary to this customer for any period of time?
John A. Hayes: I'd rather not get into that.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay, that's fine. Second, on the FX side, does that FX impact that you talked about, does that include this increase we've seen in the Swiss currency, because I know you have your European headquarters in Switzerland?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. Our -- the exposure there is really just on the people that are there, for salaries. So we don't have a lot of cost in Switzerland. So it's not that significant.
John A. Hayes: Remember, our European business is a euro-denominated business.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. All right. And then the last question I had, John, was just on Aerospace. Last quarter, you talked about perspectively having some news for us on this earnings call about new wins. I noticed that your backlog is down by about $70 million quarter-to-quarter. Can you just talk with us about sort of where some of those bids are right now, and what you think time frame might be?
John A. Hayes: Gosh, I wish I could tell you, because every time we think something, everything moves to the right. The dysfunction in Washington continues, and that we have -- I will tell you this, we have more bids outstanding than I can ever recall in the history of Ball Aerospace. We do expect some of them to happen first quarter. I think more likely, they're going to happen in the second quarter. We actually won some things, some commercial things in the fourth quarter. The issue there is these commercial entities are in the fund raising mode now. And so they need to raise the financing, but whether it was the 2 things that we announced in the fourth quarter, we feel pretty good about them, but they, they're in the process of raising money. So it's a whole amalgamation of things, and as you know, even though we've won those projects for those commercial entities, we don't count them in backlog until it's funded. And so, those are some of the things that we had referred to, and it's just -- it's taking candidly, a bit longer than we like. But despite that, the long-term prospects of the Aerospace business, we feel good about.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And would you say, today, John, that you've got sort of even more pipeline than when you talked with us in the -- at the end of the third quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think we do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Just on the specialty can start-up cost, if you could just help us size what that was in the fourth quarter? And do you anticipate any spillover of those costs early in the year?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. It was around $6 million in the fourth quarter, and then we'll have some of that in the first quarter, too, as we get to production capability near the end of the quarter.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then, you would expect by 2Q, hopefully, we're sort of at a more normalized operational rate there?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. These start-ups -- our guys do, usually a pretty good job of getting these things going and running well, but there's always a learning curve as you start the line and you start to get into it. But that pressure should reduce as we start producing cans and selling cans.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. Got it. And I think last call you had mentioned perhaps a chance with some cost savings activity that the Americas and Asia segment could be up year-over-year. But with the additional pressure, I guess in China, maybe some of these start-up costs, maybe you could, if you could, update us on your thinking there?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think the -- yes, I think we still have a shot at it, of offsetting the decline in pricing with the performance at the other segments or the other areas where we produce. But it's a little too early to call yet. It depends a lot on volumes and how things mature through the year.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. But assuming like similar volume trends in the U.S. and similar trends in the industry that we had last year, you still think that there's a shot at offsetting some of these?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I think there's a shot at it, I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't call it victory by any stretch yet.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess last question's for Scott. It's just on the interest expense guidance, I think you'd mentioned $145 million, and I believe this year, it was $160 million. So are we -- or last year, I'm sorry, in '14. So is there an assumption of debt paydown or some refinancing going on in that interest expense outlook for this year? Thanks.
Scott C. Morrison: We have a variety of plans. So that -- I'm just giving you the number that we think we'll end up with at the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: In American bev, in Brazil you talked about the timing of contractual payments as a headwind, and I was wondering is there a portion of EBIT that gets pushed into 1Q or 2015? And then some packagers are flagging electricity cost in Brazil as a major headwind for '15. I was wondering if you could comment on electricity cost for your business there?
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. The contractual payment part of it will spread out further. I wouldn't come at it, early in the year it will spread our further, it was -- it's complicated. But we'll pick that up, but it's over a period of time. On the energy side, it's definitely, with the drought that's been going on, energy costs have been going up, and that will be -- we do have a bit of a headwind from that standpoint in Brazil in '15. But despite those energy headwinds, we still expect the operating performance to be better.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then on the Food and Household side, I was wondering if it was possible to size the headwind you had in the quarter from the Danville closure and the lower production at Oakdale?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I don't have that in front of me. I don't think it was material, is what I'd say. The profitability in that segment, the fourth quarter year-over-year was down very slightly and our volume on the food side was down very slightly. So I don't think it was material.
Scott C. Morrison: Those closure costs runs through business consolidation, so it doesn't show up in the segment.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then final one, apologies if I missed this earlier, but do you have a tax rate guidance for 2015?
Scott C. Morrison: I think we said 26, around 26%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with Keybanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: You talked about beverage cans doing well in a number of regions. Can you hazard a guess as to what utilization rates are in North America and Europe? And along those lines, do you think there's a need for capacity reductions in the foreseeable future in either region?
Scott C. Morrison: Let's go region by region. I think Europe, as Scott had mentioned, it was growing low to mid-single digits. I think it was 3.5% plus or minus in the growth. And so, we're putting a new line in Oss because we are sold out there. And so I think the capacity in the industry is reasonably high there. I think as you go into North America, I don't want to speculate, I can only speak about Oss. We're running relatively full. We actually were up slightly because we were more and more weighted towards the beer segment and the specialty side of the business. And so we feel pretty good about that. I can't comment on what others are thinking. I can just tell you that for us, we have no plans in terms of further plant rationalization as we sit here today in North America.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And just a couple of others. One on EBIT for 2015. Obviously, you've talked about pension expense, FX, aluminum premiums, Chinese pricing pressure, Aerospace backlog being down, the ConAgra contract startup, et cetera. Can you give us some sense as to, assuming you expect your EBIT to be down this year, rough order magnitude?
John A. Hayes: It's too early to tell. I mean, this is what I would tell you is, you mentioned a lot of the headwinds, but we also mentioned a lot of the tailwinds that we have. Whether it's this new shaping technology for bottle cans in North America and getting that up and running, whether it's the new tin plate aerosol technology that we're going to be rolling out, whether it's the Oss facility that's going to be starting up in the second quarter, whether it's about the continued cost-out and not only in Europe but the folks in North America that have been doing a wonderful job and that's in part why our working capital's been positive, because they're on their game and being able to reduce inventories and other things like that. So we have a lot of good tailwinds as well. As I said, as we sit here today, given the headwinds you said and given the tailwinds I was mentioning, it's going to be -- I don't think, not only don't think, it's going to be very difficult to make 10% to 15%. But we're -- operationally, we're very strong, we're making investments, we're doing the right things, we're generating tons of cash and at really, your -- at the end of the day, your question, the answer to it depends on volume.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: John, thanks. And just one more, on consumer spending. Have you seen any pick up in your business on account of the recent decline in gas prices and do you expect one?
John A. Hayes: No, we haven't so far. But that doesn't surprise us, because the slowest months of the year, kind of the first couple of months of any year. As we go forward, I think there is a -- we believe that there would be a reverberation and a redistribution to those consumers. Anecdotally, I know that customers are not necessarily buying more at the convenience store when they go in and pay for their gas. They're trading up right now. But speaking to customers and others, I think people expect that to become more of a tailwind as we get to the summer. But that obviously depends on a variety of other factors as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. First, with the shaped aluminum bottle stuff, I'm presuming, and help me if I'm wrong, if that starts to show up in 2015 and 2016 through revenue and through earnings, et cetera, is this in the metal food side -- the target for this, is this beverage or is this food, personal care or what have you? And so, what segment might it show up in?
John A. Hayes: Well, we have two. The new bottles, generation 2 bottle shaping technology is in the beverage side. And as we said, we expect that to be up and running by the end of the first quarter. So the way I think about it, I wouldn't expect much in the first half of the year, but in the second half the year, that's when you really start to see it. But we also have this new tin plate aerosol technology. That won't get up and running until mid -- perhaps even late second quarter, so you won't really see much of it this year because by the time it's ramped up, the large season in terms of tinplate aerosol sales is over, and so I think that's more of a '16 opportunity.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe if I could dissect by some of the segments. I think you already earlier said that it's -- and I'm really thinking about these things on an EBIT basis year-over-year, '14 -- I'm sorry, '15 -- '14, '15. I think you said that the metal food, household segment would be difficult to be flat, and may have some headwind. As we think about some of the other regions or some of the other element, Europe in particular, with -- if you quantify it or could you quantify for us how much of a headwind currency is, and is it likely that EBIT may be down in Europe given more metal premium and currency there, and then I'm going to kind of work through some of the other geographies as well.
Scott C. Morrison: Well I -- what I said in Europe is on a constant-currency basis, their earnings will be up. Now what happens to currency, I'm not smart enough to know what will happen this year. So it really depends on where that settles out. But on a constant-currency basis, though, we're...
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, no, I can appreciate on a constant-currency basis, given some of the work, but at where we sit today, at $1.14 on the euro, and with aluminum premium, is it likely to be still up or flat down?
Scott C. Morrison: No. I think if you -- I made this comment earlier. Think about a 1% move in the euro is roughly a $0.01 impact to the company.
John A. Hayes: The reason why Scott answers it that way, don't forget, we have a bunch of euro-denominated debt.
Scott C. Morrison: Sure, pension expense...
John A. Hayes: Exactly. And so they kind of offset, so we look, we don't necessarily just look at it on an EBIT basis, because that's pure translation. You got to look it on an economic basis, which includes the interest expense and other things like that.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, when I think about -- last person I want to ask is, John, I want to take you back to 2009, when you purchased some of the metal container assets. Given your experience with that, and working through that process, I think you elected, if memory serves, to buy 4 of their facilities and left some of the other piece that's still there. At that point in time, given -- again, as you work through that process, once you learn, do you feel that you would've been able to shepherd through the process, to have acquired the whole piece from a regulatory standpoint? Or do you feel that, that would've been too difficult of a hurdle?
Scott C. Morrison: That would be pure speculation, and I'd rather not comment on it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Krayn with MidOcean Partners.
Robert Krayn: I was wondering if you guys could reaffirm some kind of leverage targets, and then maybe comment on, if something either tuck-in or anything were to kind of come up, would those -- will leverage targets be flexible, or if there's any kind of other outer bounce? And then also, if you can just comment on your cap structure. You've got some bonds that are becoming callable in a couple of weeks here, I'm wondering your thoughts on that.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I'm probably not going to comment on any of that, actually. I mean, we're full on a lot of cash, our balance sheet's in very good shape. I think we have a lot of flexibility, and I'll probably leave it at that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: One of your competitors had a pricing reduction for specialty cans in the U.S., rolling through in 2015, and I realized sizes and contracts differ, but can you comment as to how this might relate to your capacity, and could this have an impact when you're making decisions about additional conversions going forward?
John A. Hayes: What I'd tell you is from our portfolio perspective, our pricing is stable in that part of the world. And so, as you know, any investment we make, we look at what the terms of the contract are and make our decision there. So that's probably all I should say.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then my last question, just on China. Again, a lot of people have talked about volume and price, but I think incremental supply is sometimes hard to pin down in this region. I'm just curious with pricing and volume being a bit of an issue, are you seeing the influx of capacity slow down?
Scott C. Morrison: I think it's slowing down, but there's still a lot of excess capacity.
John A. Hayes: Yes. There's net capacity additions, but it's not at the rate it was. In part, we think because the can market slowed down a little bit. But again, let's put it in context. For the full year, I don't have the number it front of me, but I think it was up, it was up double digits as an industry. As the fourth quarter, it was down. So it's been strong and there's many small, individually owned plants, that they're have been adding capacity on that, and I think they're -- we're starting to see a slowdown there. But we started to see a slow down before, too, and it still had net increases.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I think full year, it's still up 13%, roughly.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you remind us what the penetration rate is for cans right now in China, and how that differed a year ago?
John A. Hayes: Yes. It's -- on the beer side, and that's what really we track because the information's better, but it's about 10%, cans as a percent of the package mix and that's, gosh, I don't know exactly what it was last year. I want to say 8%, but it's been growing, which is helpful, because as we all know, China is the largest beer market in the world.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Recognize that you may not be able to cover too much detail here. I just wanted to try to follow on. One, the new shape and size aluminum aerosol -- or excuse me, the aluminum bottle line. Does that technology allow you to, on the fly, adjust shaping? Obviously you probably have to change tools and dies and that sort of thing, or basically it produces one type of bottle?
John A. Hayes: It's a new technology, George, and once we get it up and running, we'd be delighted to have you -- to show it to you.
Scott C. Morrison: We'll pass along that suggestion to our manufacturing guys. I'm sure they'd love it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I had a similar question, and therefore I'm guessing it's going to be a similar answer on the tinplate technology line. But can you share any more color in terms of what makes it new there?
John A. Hayes: It is -- same answer, George. I would just tell you, it's a new technology on the way to make tinplate aerosol containers that we think have significant opportunity for metal savings.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, the last question I have, I'm just going through my list here. Taking a step back, you mentioned that the can is doing very well in most markets, and I'm paraphrasing there, correct it how you'd like. As you think about the next 2, 3, 4 years, whatever the right longer-term interval is from your vantage point, what do you think the biggest challenge or two, is to the beverage can? Is it global procurement, is it some potential supply threat on aluminum sheet, because everything now is going to go into automobile. What do you think the biggest threats are, and how in turn do you manage your business against those threats?
John A. Hayes: Yes, thank you, George. It's -- I hesitate to answer that question, because I don't want to run afoul of anything that we're very respectful of, relative to announcements as far -- so I'd rather not answer it. But I would tell you this, the -- not the beverage can, but the industry, writ large, there is continued -- there's relatively anemic growth, and where there is growth, there's a lot of competitors. And I say that whether it's in the automotive market or whether it's in the metals market or other things like that. I do think we have done a very good job at Ball Corporation, really focusing on the supply chain, and like you said, on the working capital side. And as we go forward, we're going to continue to do what we've been always doing.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one quick follow-up on the North American beverage business. As we go down the aisles in the grocery store these days, it seems like there's a proliferation of maybe trim cans coming into the market. Can you talk a little bit about, if you're seeing that as well in your business and maybe what the outlook is there?
John A. Hayes: Yes, we're, yes. The trim, the slim, the smaller sized cans in the soft drink. There's been a big emphasis on that over the past couple of years, and we played our part in that. It -- not only on the soft drink side, but also even on the beer side. When you think about some of the new products that have been coming out by brewers, both large and small, the standard 12-ounce container, while still very important, they're trying to add incremental growth, kind of like what I said before about creating new products with different types of packaging, different size of packaging, and that's where the specialty growth has been coming from, and we've been playing our part in it.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: A couple of questions. One is, as we think about the beverage can, you've talked a lot about penetration. But I think of any beverage that you pour into a glass from a tap, like water, what would basically be in a single or serve container. And if you think about it in that context globally, or even by region, whatever -- how big actually is the beverage can, and is that a fair way to look at the market? And I guess secondly, are you finding that your -- I know another competitor had mentioned that some of their bigger customers in beer, I think, in particular, but maybe other areas, are trying to push you guys to negotiate can contracts, at least in a globally coordinated fashion. And is that a trend that is relatively new, and something that you feel is going to change your approach to negotiations?
John A. Hayes: With respect to the second question, because I can't remember the first question. We'd rather not comment on that. I think the world is globalizing, but that's all I'll say about that.
Scott C. Morrison: On the first question, we think there's all kinds of beverages that should go into cans, and you throw out water, but I think water and sparkling -- what I'm drinking is sparkling water right, out of a can. So I think there's a lot of products that can go in cans. And that's helping the growth in finding some of these new categories.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: But would you say, like the can is less than 20% of all beverage containers, when you throw in plastics and glass?
John A. Hayes: Yes. When you think about it that way, yes. I don't -- we don't -- we'd be guessing if you gave a specific number right now. But yes, it's because when you think about still and sparkling, there's a whole plethora of packaged beverages out there.
Operator: And our next question is another follow-up from Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Scott, just on the pension. If you could help us clarify, if you have any sizable benefit this year from the Highway Funding Bill, in terms of pension funding? And if so, how you expect your required U.S. pension funding to ramp up as this benefit kind of abates?
John A. Hayes: Well, what I mentioned was, in '14, we funded up a little over $140 million into the pension plans, globally, and in '15, we'll fund less than $30 million and our pensions are in pretty good shape, from a funding standpoint. So I don't think it's -- it moves around from year to year, and frankly a lot of our funding is dependent upon timing and how strong our cash flow is, so our cash flow's quite strong. Last year we put a lot into the plan, so. We're just commenting on '15, what that looks like.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And I don't know if you have it handy, but what's the funded statuses at year end?
Scott C. Morrison: We have a number of different plans, but I think around 80% for the funded plans. We have a large German unfunded, kind of pay-as-you-go plan, so I kind of look at just the funded plans. The Americas and the U.K. were roughly around 80%.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: You talked about cost take out as being an offset of some of the headwinds. Would you be able to frame that for us a little bit, maybe perhaps talk about what that number was, and what you accomplished in '14, and maybe talk about a range for cost take out for the company in '15?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I mean in '14, you saw a lot of improvement year-over-year in terms of the European earnings, so that's despite some metal headwinds that we faced, even in '14, and '15, I think the cost take out will continue. We still have metal headwind in the first part of the year, first half of the year. But they continue to do a good job of reducing costs and so what I commented was that, on a constant-currency basis, we expect that business, the operating profit, to be up, despite the metal premium headwind.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it, Scott. And then, I believe there's a can sheet facility in Fort, one that was off-line here in the beginning part of the year or it may have started the end of last year. Can you just talk about, sort of supply of can sheet, and how that's looking right now, whether that may create some issues for the business in North America this year?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. It's all back up and running. The -- both that can sheet supplier and our whole supply chain, including all of our sourcing folks, did a really good job of managing through that, so it wasn't impactful.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then, just last one, so I think you said $7 million of higher pension expense. So just for modeling perspective, that would just be allocated across the segments. Is that fair?
Scott C. Morrison: That's -- yes, generally. I mean, it's probably more North American-centric, but that's -- you'd be okay...
John A. Hayes: And Rebecca, we'll take 1 more question, if there are any more.
Operator: Our final question is a follow-up from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: It relates to kind of business conditions and things within China. Last quarter, and maybe this is just my perception, but it seems as though you sounded much more opportunistic, with respect to deploying or potentially deploying more capital into China, in particular. The change in pricing that you talked about earlier in the call, has that, a, maybe changed the appetite for doing so? I guess really what I'm trying to get at is, you had some longer-term contracts in China and -- that were seemingly priced maybe a little above where the market was. So as stuff now has -- the pricing has changed for you, has your thinking changed with respect to what you would want to do, or potentially allocate capital in China?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think, I mean given the challenging pricing environment, we'll put capital to work where we're getting decent returns. We've got some things to do in our own operations, where we think we can improve our cost structure meaningfully. And so we're focused on the things we can control, because we can't control the pricing. And so we're going to do things in our own operations to get incremental volume out of our existing operations, and then we're going to be really prudent with additional capital in China. So it probably is a little different tone than it was a quarter ago.
John A. Hayes: Okay, thank you. With that, Rebecca, I think we're finished. And as you can tell, we're quite excited about our prospects as we go forward. We have some headwinds in 2015, but we think we have our handle on them, but we also have a fair amount of tailwind. And as we go into the second half of '15, we feel real good about the long-term prospects for our company. So we appreciate your support, and look forward to a solid 2015.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 30, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please proceed.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Edison, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2014 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I will finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014. In short, we had a solid third quarter with strong Beverage and Aerospace operating performance and a lower tax rate offsetting weaker can demand in Brazil and North American food. During the third quarter, many of the second half themes that we referenced in our last earnings call came true. Volume comps were challenging year-over-year, aluminum headwinds remained and our food and household segment continued to work through operational challenges at our U.S. metals service center. In spite of these challenges, there were a number of highlights as well. Lower operating costs in our European beverage can segment offset the LME premia headwinds we expected. Continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America nearly offset weaker demand for standard carbonated soft drink containers. Strong performance in our European impact-extruded aluminum and Aerospace businesses continued. Ball was again selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices for the second time in a row. Our food and household products business received the Partner to Win supplier award from Unilever. And the Ball-built WorldView-3 satellite was successfully launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base. As we close out 2014, we remain very focused on controlling the things we can control and managing through this low-growth environment. Given our year-to-date results and cash flow, very strong cash flow generation, 2014 is shaping up to be a very strong year for Ball Corporation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $1.10 versus last year's $1. In addition to John's comments around operating performance and a lower tax rate, a lower share count also contributed to our improved results. During the first 9 months, we acquired a net $308 million of stock and returned another $55 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And for 2014, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, there are a few minor tweaks to our 2014 financial metrics. Free cash flow is now expected to exceed $600 million. Share buybacks will continue to be in the range of $500 million. CapEx should end the year around $375 million if ongoing project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be closer to $160 million. The effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 25%, primarily due to the release of some uncertain tax positions due to lapses of the statute of limitations. And full year corporate undistributed is now expected to be closer to $85 million due to higher medical and incentive compensation costs. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.1 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.7x and net debt to comparable EBITDA of 2.5x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Also as a heads-up for the fourth quarter, Ball will record a noncash charge of approximately $40 million related to a settlement of pension obligations for certain former employees. The settlement should reduce the company's pension liabilities by approximately $80 million at year end and generate ongoing administrative and PBGC premium savings for the company's U.S. pension plans. Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were roughly flat versus third quarter 2013. While operating performance was excellent at the plant level, and mid-single-digit volume growth in China and double-digit specialty can growth in North America contributed to segment results, mid-teens volume declines in Ball's Brazilian business post-World Cup muted the segment's third quarter performance. Ultimately, Ball's mix of customers underperformed the overall market post the World Cup, resulting in us underperforming the Brazilian can industry, which was up around 1% in the third quarter. More importantly, as we head into the fourth quarter in Brazil, the summer selling season is upon us, and we expect Ball's volumes to bounce back to seasonal fourth quarter norms. European segment profit was up roughly $3 million in the third quarter on essentially flat volumes, and aluminum premium headwinds being more than offset by anticipated cost-out efforts. As John briefly touched on, the LME premium is meaningfully higher than it was in our last conference call, and we expect EUR 6 million of premium cost to flow through in the fourth quarter. Depending on the strength of fourth quarter volumes, our ongoing cost savings initiatives might be enough to offset the aluminum premium headwinds for the remainder of this year. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down approximately $15 million in the quarter, as segment volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies in our U.S. metals service center pressured the results. More specifically, North American food can volumes were down nearly 8%, with about half the decline due to a very poor salmon pack. On the flip side, our extruded -- European extruded aluminum business continues to perform at a high level. As the food and household segment enters 2015, improving operating efficiencies, pruning the manufacturing footprint and related administrative and plant headcounts are items within our control, and the team is executing on these initiatives to ensure a rightsized cost base after the January 1, 2015, customer shift. In summary, our global beverage operating team continues to execute on near-term capital projects that will improve our business in North America, Europe and Asia in the second half of 2015 while also identifying additional cost-efficient, high-returning growth opportunities to benefit Ball in future years. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business continues to exceed expectations. During the quarter, solid execution, a flawless on-orbit deployment of a Ball-built satellite, and niche product wins for antennas and sensors are some of the highlights. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $846 million. And while we have secured some smaller contract awards in the third quarter, larger programs that we are in the process of bidding on are expected to be awarded either late this year or more likely in 2015. Overall government contracting continues to slide slightly to the right, and we're keeping a close eye on this during the election cycle. Now looking out across our company today. We are pleased with our year-to-date results and the incredible employee effort it took to accomplish them. Though some challenges still exist, there are also many opportunities to improve our businesses going forward. With 9 months under our belt, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% per year while growing both our EVA dollars, and as we've done for the prior 5 years, returning nearly all the free cash flow back to our fellow shareholders. And with that, Edison, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First off, for the volume declines in Brazil, is it a customer-specific issue that maybe impacted numbers during the third quarter? Any specific region within Brazil that stood out as particularly weak? And also, can you quantify what's actually happening in October there?
Scott C. Morrison: Ghansham, this is Scott. It really is customer-specific. We -- our customer base wasn't one of the official sponsors of the World Cup, and the other customers, I think, saw a bump in the second quarter. And I think that got carried into the third quarter. And so it really was customer-specific, I don't think anything to get too alarmed about. We're seeing -- we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, but it appears like it's tracking back to normal and what we would have expected. So we expect the fourth quarter to be more normalized.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just kind of thinking about 2015. Realizing it's a little bit early, but I was focusing on Americas, Asia, you do have an FX headwind there. The World Cup, obviously, benefited, at least part of 2014. And North American CSD seems to be sort of a sluggish category, and it seems like that's probably a good run rate for next year as well. Do you actually foresee operating income going up year-over-year in 2015 for that segment?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think if you go piece by piece, North American beverage continues to perform very well. Cost-out activities being very efficient. Growth in specialty can is helping to grow earnings and grow EVA dollars in that business. Brazil, we talked about before, even in the second quarter, we thought 2015 would be flatter, but they're doing some things from a cost-out perspective that I think will help it from an efficiency standpoint. In Asia, the volumes continue to grow. It's really dependent on pricing, where pricing settles out when we get to the end of this year and into next year. But with volume growth, hopefully, we can offset any pricing pressures. So actually do expect it to grow next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: If I could take one second and focus on the metal food and household, you specifically cited some inefficiencies in service centers, and I was thinking that you were consolidating a few of those. Is there anything extra to that? Or could you give us some color there?
John A. Hayes: Yes, you're right, Chris. We have, over the last couple of years, consolidated those, and we've just -- we've had -- there's been a variety of issues. As I said on the second quarter, some of them have been self-inflicted, some of them have not. And what I mean by that, to give you a little bit more color around that, is we have actually put -- we took out some of the excess slack in our capacity. And when you do that, it puts a higher burden on you to perform, and we haven't been performing as well as we could. Having said that, we've had some quality issues from some of our metal suppliers and some on-time delivery that has exacerbated that a little bit. The way -- given that it's a service center and it's on the front end of the manufacturing part of our supply chain, if you will, we did see this coming, and that's why we said back at the end of the second quarter that for the second half of this year that we'd have to kind of flow this through, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are very much focused. We think we are on the right track, but it's just going to take a little bit of time. And as we go into 2015, we expect this to sequentially get much better.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And have you quantified what the headwind was for this, or could you?
John A. Hayes: No, we talked about -- I think in the second quarter, I did say roughly 1/3 of our decline was related to volume and roughly 2/3 manufacturing, and that held generally true in the third quarter.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Last question I had was on the Aerospace side. It looked like you had another really strong quarter there. And were there any elements that were unusual with performance payments? You mentioned a flawless execution. Bottom line, I guess what we're trying to get our arms around is how we should think about '15 as kind of a normalized rate there, given what you see in the backlog that you have today?
John A. Hayes: Yes. It's -- roughly speaking, I think year-to-date, we've made about $70 million of EBIT in that business. And so that averages about, what, $23-or-so million. And I do think that our business has been running well. I think -- the bigger issue, I think, Chris, is not so much that because we've talked about it being lumpy, and there wasn't anything out of the -- extraordinary in the quarter. I think it's really as much as to when the government and some of these commercial enterprises are going to start awarding contracts and getting money flowing. Because like everything with the government, seems like things just start to push out a little bit. A couple of quarters ago, we thought that we'd have a lot of these opportunities decided by the end of '14, and now it looks like they're kind of split between the end of '14 and the first quarter of '15. And so nothing to be alarmed about. It's just still sliding a little bit, and that's really going to be the driver as we go into 2015.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just had a question on the European beverage, I guess volume's down a little bit. And do you think that's more of just tough comps? Or just -- are you generally seeing a slowdown going forward? I don't know if you have any sort of thoughts on what Q4 could look like.
Scott C. Morrison: No, it was really tough comps, Tyler. Last year, if you remember, volumes really started to ramp up in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. So we knew we had tougher comps in the second half of the year, and that's how that works. We're seeing that.
John A. Hayes: Yes. It's interesting also, the weather in the third quarter was not all that good. And you just look at some of our customers' results, both on the soft drink and the beer side. And when you try and look geography, region by region, what was going on, you really kind of saw it in many different places, everywhere from the East to France, Netherlands, U.K. They were all softer than we had expected and flat to down slightly, actually.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And are you seeing any sign that's getting a little bit better through October? Or is it too early to tell?
Scott C. Morrison: Fourth quarter is kind of a slower volume quarter. So I wouldn't expect big trends out of this quarter, but I think it's kind of normalized.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Exactly.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just with China. I mean, I guess you -- how much more, I guess, with your existing capacity do you think you can kind of continue to grow? I guess you're up mid-single digits this quarter. I mean, can you -- outside of capacity, can you continue to kind of grow with the market, given your current footprint?
Scott C. Morrison: I think we can continue to speed things up, but those guys are doing a really good job of being able to eke out more and more out of those facilities. But we're still seeing solid growth, and so we'll be careful about how we deploy capital. But where we think we can get decent returns, we'll deploy capital and grow.
John A. Hayes: Yes. We've been -- as you know, we've been full all year, but we've been able to "eke out" mid- to upper-single digit volumes. So at some point in time, the low-hanging fruit will be over, but as Scott said, I think that our guys have been doing a very nice job of getting -- sweating the assets.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And just last question on working capital. Now it looks like it's going to be a strong contributor this year and sort of in the past several years, the same thing. I mean, is there a lot much more -- I mean, I know you're always working to get more, but could it be as big of a contributor just going forward? Or should things slow down a little bit?
Scott C. Morrison: Every year, I keep thinking we're about done with what we can do. And our people across the business, in the businesses, in treasury, in IT, in sourcing, have all done a great job of continuing to have various types of programs to eke out more benefits, more dollars out of working capital. I think we're going to have another decent year this year of being a source of funds, and I think it will continue in '15. How much beyond that, I don't know, but I think we'll see another benefit next year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just wanted to focus on the free cash flow for a minute in 2014. You did take it up by $50 million. I didn't hear on the CapEx part if you took CapEx down. But could you walk through the bridge between the $550 million and $600 million of free cash flow in 2014?
Scott C. Morrison: It's mostly better working -- we still think we're going to spend -- we got to spend at a pretty good clip in the fourth quarter to get to the $375 million, but we're still thinking we're going to get to the $375 million. But most of the change really had to do with working capital.
John A. Hayes: Yes, certainly relative to our prior expectations. I think, year-over-year, it's coming from all that. I think we have much stronger net income and earnings growth as well as working capital.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And is the better working capital coming from the facility closures? Or is there something you can point to that was really driving better working capital for the year?
John A. Hayes: I think when you go through our balance sheet, you can see it everywhere. I think we've done a very good job on the receivables side of it. We've done an excellent job on the inventory side of it. Our days outstanding have improved meaningfully. And then on the payables side, as Scott had mentioned, everywhere from IT to sourcing to manufacturing, our folks have been doing a very good job of not only measuring but managing those things.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And when I look at -- you mentioned still thinking $375 million of CapEx in 2014. Obviously, some of that slipped from, I think, 2013 to 2014 before. But assuming nothing slips into 2015, what sort of step-down should we assume in CapEx as we move into 2015?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, Scott, in my life at Ball, I've never seen capital not slip into the next year. So there'll be some that'll slip. We've got a number of good-sized projects we're working on that will go into '15. We're adding specialty capacity in Europe and in North America. We'll be building our Myanmar plant. We've got some growth in aluminum aerosol. We're still finding good opportunities to deploy capital and get above target returns. So right now, to call 2015 CapEx is probably too early, but we'll update you as we get in -- kind of get into next year on what that might look like.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montréal.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I wondered if we could get just a sense of what you see as kind of underlying beverage can growth outside of North America right now. What's Brazil doing? What's the underlying market in China? And what are you seeing in Europe?
John A. Hayes: I think one of the bigger trends that we continue to see in most places is that can continues to take share from other forms of packaging, particularly in the beer category. And so I do think -- and we've talked about this earlier on the call that there has been a -- in the third quarter, there was a bit of a slowdown in Brazil, for example. The overall market was much more muted after the World Cup. There was a mix issue relative to customer base there. But I don't think fundamentally, things have changed in a material way. In Europe, the weather wasn't all that great, and the overall economy is a bit softer than expected in Europe. But again, we don't see any trends that are different than what we saw. Over in Asia, China in particular, but also Southeast Asia, we continue to see beer growing faster than, perhaps, the herbal teas and the energy drinks and the soft drinks, and you're seeing cans continue to take share from competitive packages in those categories. And so nothing fundamentally has changed. I think there were some issues related to the third quarter that we saw, but we don't expect those to be a trend, so to speak.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And then you guys have talked about a new product for an undisclosed customer in North America in 2015. I just -- I wondered when we'll be able to get some sense of what the product might be and then the size of that opportunity for Ball.
John A. Hayes: I think in the -- certainly, as we go into 2015 and the first half of 2015, it's something that our customer has asked us not to talk about until they're ready to talk about it. So we're respecting their wishes.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And finally, can you just talk about the metal premium issue as we move toward 2015?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. It continues to be a headwind. It was a bigger headwind in the third quarter. It grew a little bit, so it's even a little larger headwind in the fourth quarter. And if it doesn't come down, it would be a drag into '15. But it's been pretty volatile. But right now, we said, in the fourth quarter, it's probably EUR 6 million or EUR 7 million different year-over-year.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. And it sounds, Scott, from just listening to other players in the industry that we're not likely to see terms change contractually over the next year or so with regards to passing that premium on. Is that your view as well?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, you need to have contracts mature and roll off and then renegotiate new contracts. So you don't get that much of your contracts that roll off each year, maybe 1/3 roughly. And so on new contracts, I think it's something where -- it hasn't been just a temporary spike. It's been pretty much a permanent rise or what appears to be a longer-term rise in the premium. And so that needs to come into play when we're looking at what the products should be priced at.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess my first question was just a piggyback on Mark's prior question. You talked about trends not changing relative to the third quarter's one-off issues, but I was hoping you might be able to actually talk specifically about fourth quarter. In Brazil, are you seeing a year-on-year increase at this juncture in beverage can shipments, recognizing that, seasonally, things should be picking up anyway? And for Europe and for China, can you talk to what the early growth rates are in the quarter? And then on the same topic of growth, if you mentioned it, I've missed it. What did you say your North American beverage can volumes grew at in 3Q?
John A. Hayes: George, this is John. Let me try and handle that. It's -- recognize that the month of October isn't even finished, so it's kind of tough to talk about that. But in Brazil, as Scott said, we had kind of expected kind of flattish volumes in the second half of this year and in the third quarter, they were a bit softer than that. But we are ramping up towards their summer selling season, and we're seeing much more -- volumes much more getting back to kind of flattish -- it depends as an industry, maybe up very, very slightly. But I think, for us -- and that's all I can comment on right now because I've seen no industry data for us down in Brazil, they have bounced back from what was a soft third quarter full stop. I think, in Asia, we're seeing the exact same thing. We're seeing decent growth there, and we're -- we are -- because we're tight from a capacity point of view, we are trying to sell as many as we can and get as many out the door as we can. And over in Europe, we have seen -- it really was -- when you go back and look at the quarter, it was really in the month of August that we saw some softness. And I think as you go into the October, November, December, the biggest time of the month -- of the quarter in the fourth quarter is really the month of late November and December because that's around the Christmas season. And so it's before that, but everything's kind of going according to what our expectations would be. Getting back to your question in North America bev, I think the overall market was down, call it, about 1-ish percent. We're about the same as well. I think that when you take a step back, Scott had mentioned our specialty was up double digit, our beer was up a couple of percent and our soft drink was off 3-ish percent, plus or minus. And so that's -- when you weighted average all of that, that's why we're off very slightly relative to being flat.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I want to go back to food and household. You said that the manufacturing issues were roughly comparable 2Q to 3Q in terms of their proportion of the year-on-year decline, if we look at 2Q '13 to 2Q '14 and similarly 3Q and 3Q. Yet if I did my math correctly, the dollar decline in 3Q versus 3Q was greater than what we saw in 2Q. So is that just the cumulative effect of seasonality and just you have that much more volume in the third quarter and, therefore, the inefficiencies were magnified by that? Or were there some other factors at work? And then specific to the manufacturing issues, are you having any kind of quality issues either with the sheet you're producing, the decoration you're doing, anything like that? Or is it more on the, if you will, the supplier side?
John A. Hayes: Well, getting to your question, you're absolutely right because the third quarter is the seasonally high selling point for it. I think it was magnified a bit by that. And as you know, when you -- the turns, from an inventory perspective, in that business are lower than they are in the beverage can business. And so it takes some time for it to snake through the system, if you will. And so that's why we're able -- we knew that was -- as we look forward into the third quarter, that would be forthcoming. With respect to the quality issues, I don't think -- it certainly is a combination of things, but when you're -- we're not running smoothly and then you have some quality issues from the metal perspective, I think it puts a little bit more stress on the system. But again, I think most of it, we believe, is to be behind us not completely, but as we go into 2015, we feel pretty confident where we sit right now that we've got our hands on the issue and that we're cycling through these issues.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And I guess my last question before I turn it over. Our rough math would suggest that pension, if we look at current discount rates, might be worth a $0.10 plus of headwind next year to the company. Do you have an official view or unofficial view that you care to share at this juncture?
Scott C. Morrison: A little too early to tell, George, because it's all set right at the end of the year. You're right, right now, if rates stayed where they're at, it's a bit of a headwind. But part of what I mentioned of this -- or paying out terms -- certain term-vested pension and reducing our liability will help net income next year. So that's a plus. So you kind of have to get through the end of the year to know what it will do, but I'd say, net-net, it's probably not a big mover one way or the other.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George -- sorry, Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just had a follow-up question on pack mix shifts. You talked about the shift to cans you're seeing outside of the U.S. And I was just wondering about if you could talk about what you've seen in the U.S. this year. It seems like cans have outperformed glass more than some of us had expected. And I was wondering, are your conversations with customers accelerating? Or would you expect this to continue into 2015, even if the consumer gets a little bit stronger? I was just wondering if you could provide some detail on what you're seeing in the U.S.
John A. Hayes: Yes. I think, largely where we've seen the growth, and you see it from an industry perspective as well as a Ball perspective, is on the beer side. And the can as a share of the package mix on the beer side has continued to grow, even through the first 3 quarters of 2014. So I think that's a trend that certainly we've been benefiting from. Some of it has to do with the craft beer that we've talked about in past conference calls. Some of it has to do with consumer preferences. I don't see any appreciable change as we go into 2015. Obviously, it's a bit premature. But at some point in time, the can will be well penetrated relative to that. So I wouldn't expect over the long term that we're going to infinitely continue to gain share as a percentage of the package mix, but we've certainly been a beneficiary of it right now. But we do also, at the same time, see on the craft side, continued good penetration growth into that area.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting to food and household. Can you talk a little bit more about the India opportunity in extruded aluminum and what your investment there is?
John A. Hayes: Yes. I don't think we've disclosed the size of investment. But it's a decent size but not huge, to be honest. But it's a great opportunity as that business continues to -- the customer base continues to globalize. We had a great opportunity to make an investment in there. And we expect kind of by this time next year, we'll be up and running. We're focusing on not only the regional customers but some of the global customers as well. And well, as I said, we're only putting 1 line initially, so it's not that big of an investment. I think, over time, we will be happy that we've gotten into the business because in India, the market for those containers is several hundred million, and it's growing at 20-plus percent.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So the real earnings contribution there is in 2016, essentially?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think so.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: John, I wanted to circle up with some of your earlier comments on expecting some growth in the Americas and Asia bev segment. How instrumental do you see North America earnings growth in that view next year? And I guess that's part one of that question.
John A. Hayes: I do think there is some earnings growth in North America, I think both from this mix issue as specialty continues to grow. But equally important, we've been spending a lot of time, and there's a fair amount of fruit we can go after in terms of the freight logistics and optimizing our footprint perspective. Over the past several years, we've put some systems in place that have been helpful in terms of providing a level of transparency around our costs on the freight and transportation at a far greater clip than we've had in the past. And so we have specific plans that we're going after some of those things. So I think for those 2 reasons, mix as well as the cost side of our business, I think there's some upside there.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And following on that, any -- at this juncture, can you give us a sense maybe what you think the cost-out opportunity is there? And in addition, is there anything specific that you have visibility on, some sort of contractual gains, specific share gain on cans for next year that belies some of the confidence as well?
John A. Hayes: No. I think on -- second part first. I just think we have a pretty good footprint in terms of specialty, and that has been growing. We're overweighted towards beer, and that's been growing. So I think qualitatively, we feel okay there. And then on the cost-out side, it's a bit premature to talk about that. But it's not insignificant dollars when you think about we've got a base, we've got a revenue base of well in excess of $3 billion there. And so I think there's real opportunity there.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: I appreciate that. And then just a second question is just based on -- assuming aluminum premiums look like they'll continue to be a headwind, what's the opportunity next year -- some of the -- you've been able with cost-outs this year, you've been quite successful at that, offsetting this. What's the opportunity to continue to maybe offset some of the headwinds next year with cost-outs? And just as some of the contracts roll off, maybe the opportunity to recover some of the loss margin as well.
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. Well, our guys continue to be very focused on taking cost out. I was just with the European guys recently, and they have a number of things that they're working on that will continue to make their business more efficient. On the contract side, you have to wait until those customer contracts expire and you're negotiating a new one before you can get any kind of a pass-through or change the pricing mechanism so that you're incorporating into your price. So that takes a little bit longer. But in all of our businesses, we're always very focused on costs and making ourselves more efficient and offsetting these kind of headwinds.
John A. Hayes: The only thing I would add is -- we don't -- let's not forget that we've -- making an investment to continue to grow our business in Oss in the Netherlands. In 2013, we have been running full out. And typically, when you run full out with the seasonality that business has, you leave some money on the table relative to some of the freight and other opportunities. I'd mentioned that we're doing a lot in North America, and we -- I think our European folks are trying to grab on to some of the ideas that our North American people have been doing. And there's a lot of opportunity. As we get a little bit more capacity to be able to run a little bit more smoothly, I think to optimizing the shipping lanes and the freight costs, there's going to be some opportunities over time there as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: John, I had a question about the -- I noticed the other day, or maybe it was yesterday, you all appointed a new director to the board. And I didn't know if that was a replacement director or an -- and it looks like he has quite a background in aerospace. And I didn't know if that was basically a sign that maybe you're going to make aerospace a bigger part of what Ball is all about.
John A. Hayes: Well, a couple of things I'd point out. Number one, we have -- we, like many companies, have mandatory retirements for our directors at 72 years old. And so without going into any details, over the next few years, we have directors retiring. And so this was -- Mike's a wonderful person, has a great reputation, has a lot of great experience, not only in the aerospace side but just in general management. He's a finance person by background. He ran Boeing Capital for a while. So he has a lot of very good finance expertise. And as we started talking with him, it just made a lot of sense to get him on board and help with the transition over time as by natural forces, some of our board members retire.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, got you. And then going back to India, that's been obviously -- not only does it have great opportunity with being the second most populous country, but it's been a challenge for other folks in the packaging business there. And I was just wondering, as you look to India, could we see what looks like to be a food can initiative eventually become a beverage can initiative? And if it did, does it make sense that -- can you do something like that in baby steps? Or as we've seen in most other places, the scale of investment required make that less likely?
John A. Hayes: Well, yes. First, in India, just so we're clear, it's actually an aluminum impact-extruded opportunity. And as you know, the scale of that relative to putting a beverage can line is very, very different. And so this is an opportunity for us to start small and grow as that market continues to grow. Whether or not we then think about using the experience learned in doing business in India and gravitate it over the beverage can side, that remains to be seen. But you are right, the scale of beverage can investments, at least historically, have been much greater and very different than impact-extruded. We have -- particularly in Asia, our guys have done a very good job of really focusing on how to make smaller-scale investments on the beverage can side, and it's probably premature to talk about that a little bit. But we have no specific plans as we sit here today to be announcing and building beverage can capacity in India. But certainly, you never know.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And then last quick one. I know Brazil has seen a major move in the last 5, 10 years in displacing other substrates for aluminum. And I think in the beer category, we must be pushing the mid-40s in terms of the percent that are in a can. And I think North America is around 55%. If you could correct those numbers and tell us how many more years do you think we get until we hit sort of a saturation point in Brazil?
John A. Hayes: Well, it's a good question. I think your numbers are generally in line with what reality is. In North -- excuse me, in the United States, it's actually a little bit higher, it's probably 57%, 58%. It's interesting when you go around the world and you look at it, you look at the can penetration rates. In the U.K., it's north of 60%. We mentioned the United States. In other places, it's lower. It really depends. And there's 2 factors that go into it. Number one, it's consumer preference. But number two, it's also on-trade versus off-trade. I think down in Brazil, you have seen a shift over time as people have more disposable income that they have been moving a little bit more to the off-trade, and as they move to the off-trade, they've gone to one-way packaging. And as they go to one-way packaging, they've gone to the can. That is a trend that we see time and time again, and I think even you're seeing it a bit in China, for example, as the can as a share of the package mix continues to grow there. So I think you're directionally correct. Will it get to 55%? Will it get to 60%? When will it get to that? It's a bit premature to speculate. But you're absolutely right, probably 6, 7, 8 years ago, it was in the 20%, now it's in the mid-40s.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Deborah Jones with Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was hoping you could talk about -- well, there have been a few large M&A moves in the space lately. And I'm just wondering about Ball's appetite for M&A right now. And if you could maybe contrast those opportunities with internal projects or share repurchases?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Well, Debbie, as you know, we are all about EVA discipline. And we've made a tremendous amount of money over time by being very disciplined around that. And nothing has changed on that front. Right now, as we sit here, we see more opportunities, actually, over the past couple of years, in terms of internal greenfield investments where we've been able to generate returns relative to the prices one has to pay in the M&A world. Sometimes, the M&A world comes and goes, depending on financing markets and depending on other things like that. And so we're going to continue to deploy capital per our EVA discipline, whether internal or external. And in the meantime, we've created a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders by being disciplined and if we don't see opportunities by buying back our stock and returning it to our shareholders that way. And so the key point of all that is nothing's changing.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, if I could just ask a question on China. Should we expect Ball to grow in line with the industry at this point without adding new capacity? And then are you more or less optimistic about China than you were maybe 6 months to a year ago?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I think we're going to -- if it grows at 20%, we're not able to add capacity to that level. So I think we could get a little bit smaller from a market share standpoint. We want to make sure that we're deploying capital where we can make money. Am I feeling better or worse about it? It still continues to grow, but there's still a ton of competition. So pricing environment is not as disciplined. I'm hoping that what we've seen in the last year is the floor of pricing, but you just kind of never know. We're trying to focus on all the things that we can control, from a cost-out standpoint, to make our business more efficient and more profitable without relying upon price recovery. And if price recovery happens, we'll get a nice leverage on that, but kind of control what you can control.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Hutter with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Guys, it's actually Phil. Hopped on a little late. A question for you, Scott. Free cash flow for 2014 coming in really strong. I understand that working capital is quite advantageous this year. But thinking about '15, is $600 million a good base to work on going forward?
Scott C. Morrison: I'm sorry. What was the number you threw out?
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: $600 million free cash flow.
Scott C. Morrison: For '15?
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. It kind of depends on what the CapEx is and what working capital is. So I wouldn't -- I'm not -- what I said was that we could continue to generate money out of working capital next year as we did this year. And I don't think there'll be a meaningful difference in CapEx, so I think it should stay relatively high. I think free cash flow should stay relatively high. Whether it starts from $600 million or not, I don't know
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then your food can business, from a margin standpoint, it's a bit lighter than we expected. Part of that is, obviously, the operational setbacks. But how much of that was pricing too? I understand you guys ceded some price in the quarter. And how should we be thinking about margin next year with one of your lower-margin customers exiting your portfolio?
John A. Hayes: Yes. From a pricing perspective, it's nothing appreciable. It really had to do with volumes and operating performance that -- Phil, I know you weren't on, but we talked about earlier. So if you want to talk offline or if you want to read the transcript, that's fine. As we go into next year, margins, actually, on a pure margin basis, it probably should be better because when you look at the mix issues of that, I think it's premature to say because we haven't quantified those things. But we already have begun to take actions to take additional costs out of our system. And so from a margin percentage perspective, it should be better next year.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just my last question. On the extruded aluminum business, India is a new opportunity for you. I would have imagined Brazil being a larger opportunity set. Can you talk about what's available there? Or are you guys approaching it more from an M&A standpoint?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think I'd rather not go into any specific details about what our strategic plans are. But what I would say is, on a global basis, there continues to be opportunities. That package grows, is growing in many places. The growth is a bit more muted here in the United States, although it is growing here. A lot of filling is going from the United States down into Mexico, and there is some growth down in South America generally, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Argentina. In fact, Argentina is quite a large user of those containers. So we keep our eyes on that. And it's really a function of where we can generate the most EVA dollars, whether it's greenfield investments or M&A opportunities.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Forgive me if my questions were asked. I just got on a bit late. Just one about 2015, and I know it's early, but can you talk about -- in broad terms, about which segments you think you can grow next year and profit-wise. I mean, Brazil is obviously facing tough comparisons. North America, both in bev and food, are flattish, modestly down. Europe is, obviously, a tough economy at the moment. And aerospace has had a really terrific year this year. So I would think the year-ago comparisons next year would be fairly challenging. So any thoughts you have along those lines would be appreciated.
John A. Hayes: Why doesn't Scott -- why don't you jump on beverage, and I'll go through the other one.
Scott C. Morrison: Okay. Yes, we did cover that, but I'll give you quick color on that. North American beverage, we feel pretty good about. It's all dependent on volume, what happens with 12 ounce in soft drink business. But our specialty business continues to grow, and so we've been able to grow earnings and EVA dollars in that business, and we'd expect that to continue to occur next year. China, the volumes continue to grow. And while the pricing environment remains tough, we've been able to grow volumes and offset some of that price pressure. We haven't got into the real season of setting the price for next year. So we don't have that good of visibility into what '15 looks like, but our guys are doing a nice job on the cost side. In Brazil, we've had -- our business probably didn't get as much of a pop from the World Cup as we thought it would. And so next year does look slower, but I think we can continue to improve the profitability. We're probably not at the pace that we've had, a couple of jumps we've had in the last few years. And in Europe, there's a lot of cost-out still going on. There's volume growth, specialty volume growth. And it depends on business -- aluminum premium come off a lot or not. If it stays high, it is a pretty significant headwind. So we'll see. But we feel pretty good about where all the businesses are at, and then more importantly, the investments that we're making today that will make our business better later in '15 and then -- and definitely in '16.
John A. Hayes: Yes. And then from a food and household products as well as an aerospace perspective, I think food's going to be challenged and make the profitability just because of this customer shift that's happening 1/1/15. Although having said that, we fully expect to get back on track, relative to the operational improvements or issues we've been having in 2014, so that will provide a positive bridge. It's premature to say, can we get back to the full year '14 because '14 hasn't even finished. I think it's a bit of a stretch, but our guys are pushing real hard. Our men and women pushing really hard on that. And then on the aerospace side, you are right, we have been growing very nicely. We have a number of proposals outstanding as we go into 2015. So it's dependent upon that. But I think, overall, when you take a step back and you think about how we feel, not only going into '15 but longer term, I think we feel pretty good. We're making investments in Myanmar. We're making specialty investments in North America. We're building -- expanding our footprint in Europe through the Oss. From a cost-out perspective, we've spent a lot of money on the systems side of our business, and we see a lot of low-hanging fruit from a freight and warehouse logistics in addition to just continuous improvement there. And we continue to see opportunities to capture our share of the growth, whether it be in the Americas, Europe or certain parts of Asia. And so I think we feel okay as we sit here today, looking out, saying we can continue to grow our business and make it a stronger, healthier business while, at the same time, as I've said before, maintaining a very strict discipline around the EVA dollar generation that we always talk about.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And just one on -- John, on North American beverage cans. How would you characterize the market at the moment? Obviously, CSD remains fairly weak. One of your competitors yesterday talked about weakness among the mega-beer brands in the U.S. But you've got specialty growing for you, obviously, to some extent. So to what extent is the growth in specialty offsetting these other factors? And how do you see that playing out beyond this year?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think earlier, maybe you weren't on, but we talked about we had growth in specialty and we had growth in beer this year. And soft drink has been down. I think year-to-date, we're up slightly. We're up probably about 1% or so for the full year. Forget about the third quarter for a minute. It's driven by growth in specialty, growth in beer, offset by declines in CSD. We all know that CSD is under a lot of pressure, but let's broaden the definition, and what I'm talking about is not just sodas. It's sparkling beverages. And I think we've seen some good growth in sparkling waters and some other things like that. I do know that the soda companies are acutely focused on trying to make sure that they're as relevant in today's environment, where health and wellness plays a more important part. Will they be able to turn that tide at a rate better than they have in the past? It's premature to see. But I do think, as we go into 2015, what I just described, even though some of these "mega-beer brands" are having a little bit of volume issues, the can has been winning relative to other substrates, and we still have only upper single digit, if not very low teens, penetration on the craft side.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.
Andrew Feinman: Given your EVA discipline and the fact that you have been patient, I've been thinking that this was -- this is probably a good opportunity for you to at least consider deploying some capital in the aerospace and technologies business, given the uncertainties in that industry and the prices of those companies have come down. And so then today, you announced this really great new board member, Michael Cave, who you would -- I would think could really help you a lot in that process. So the question is, do you think we might see some opportunities for increases in the value of Ball Corporation through its hidden gem, the aerospace and technologies business sometime in the investable future?
John A. Hayes: Yes, Andy, this is John. Two observations. Number one is I think in each and every one of our businesses, we're going to continue to be very disciplined on the EVA dollar side of it. Having said that, I do think that as we look into the aerospace side of the business, there are opportunities, as you point out. As a wise, old colleague once said, you need motive and opportunity at the same time. And so you have to be patient about these things. But when you're patient and you're digging hard, opportunities over time come your way. And so we have been looking in that area. Obviously, we haven't announced anything. We made a small acquisition in January of last year that's doing very well, and it got us into a whole new customer segment, which is great. So we continue to look at things like that. So I wouldn't disagree with your thesis that you're laying out. But obviously, we're continuing to focus, but we're going to be disciplined.
Operator: And we do have some follow-up questions. The next follow-up question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. We will proceed with the next question from -- it's a follow-up as well from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montréal.
Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Just a couple of emerging markets issues. One, John, I wonder if you guys can just explain to us how you think about that Indian market for beverage cans, because it's just kind of amazing to me that we're seeing so much expansion in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, elsewhere, and yet that beverage can market in India relative to the size of the market seems so, so small at this point. What will it take for that to grow? And then the other question I have for you is, is there a way to kind of tap into some of these smaller but faster growing markets in places like Southern Africa? Can you build a facility that's less than 800 million cans or 1 billion cans?
John A. Hayes: Well, as you know, scale is important in beverage cans. We often talk about India being India. Well, there's, I believe, 26 different states there. Some ban the consumption of alcohol, some do not. And so you really have to get much more prescriptive in looking at it. You also have the urban versus rural areas where you have so many people. But the number of people that can actually consume packaged goods is a very small number, particularly when you look at the price points of what they earn versus what it costs to do that type of thing. And so it's always been the dream that it's going to continue to grow. But at the end of the day, beverage business remains a scale business, and that even gets to your question about Africa. There's only a couple of countries to date that have shown any ability to have enough scale where it makes sense, whether it's South Africa or whether it's Angola, Nigeria. Those are really the 3 only places other than the far north of Africa that have any kind of beverage can manufacturing facilities. As that continues to grow and the middle class starts to develop, it's no different than India. I think that's the most important thing. The middle class has to grow before you see opportunities there.
Operator: The next one is also a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I will try to ask these in sequence, just given it's late in terms of timing. First of all, John or Scott, would it be possible to parse in your CapEx this year and perhaps next year what you're spending on some of the newer initiatives? I'm not asking to identify each one, but if maybe there's a way to aggregate the total that you're spending on the cost-out programs, the new line in North America, Oss and so on. Would that be possible, at least on a public forum?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think, George, if you think about it, just take $375 million of capital and think -- maintenance capital is probably between $150 million and $200 million. So you've got a couple of hundred million dollars of growth, if you will, growth capital. From a -- when you say cost-out, it really hasn't been that much spending on cost-out. Most of the spending that we're doing is on adding, really, a lot of specialty capacity, whether it's in Europe or North America or in the past, Brazil, or even in Asia. So a lot of it is growth capital with better than typical returns over time. Now you got to mature into those returns. But they're investments that we're likely to make. And also in the aluminum aerosol business, we've added some capacity there. So most of that $200 million of growth is really focused on better returning type projects and not really -- we haven't had to spend a lot of capital on cost-out. I would say, it's a small minority of what we're spending in total.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. So the freight and logistical and all the other points that you made in terms of potential cost-out for 2015 and beyond, that will require relatively little incremental investment either in terms of capital or, for that matter, other cash cost. Would that be a fair point?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. I think in the total scheme of things, if you think we're spending $375 million, way less than 10% of it is on cost-out stuff.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of looking back at third quarter, just from the standpoint of trying to establish a base for the future, would it be fair to say that your profits, if we actually had visibility into this, Brazilian profits were clearly down because of your volume decline, but your North American and Chinese -- or Asian, excuse me, profitability was up year-on-year?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. Looks -- both those businesses have performed well. Really, the quarter was all about -- the miss was all about what happened in Brazil and the volumes.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. The last one, and I'll turn it over. China, can you comment at all in terms of whether you are closer than you were, say, 3 months ago to a new investment there, recognizing it'll be driven by EVA, contracts, et cetera? And totally switching gears on free cash flow, I recognize you raised free cash flow guidance. A lot of it is from working capital. But interestingly, the third quarter versus third quarter free cash performance was actually down. So was there anything else -- or how do you raise free cash flow guidance despite free cash being down year-on-year in third quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: Okay. Well, I guess, by the factor of every day that goes on, we're closer technically to when we spend capital in China. So I guess we're closer from that standpoint. But on a serious note, we're continuing to do a good job of getting our cost structure in a place where we can make investments and get the returns. That's really the magic of future capital spending in China. We've got to be able to make the returns, not just to grow with the market. The second part of your question had to do with free cash flow guidance and the change?
John A. Hayes: In third quarter.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's correct.
Scott C. Morrison: Third quarter this year versus third quarter last year?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It was down, yet you raised your numbers. You mentioned working capital. We get it. But was there anything else that drove that increase in free cash flow guidance despite what was a year-on-year worsening in free cash flow?
Scott C. Morrison: I see what you're saying. No. It's got to do with all the other things, non-earnings things that we're doing on inventories, payables, receivables, all of those other factors.
John A. Hayes: And Edison, thank you. We appreciate everyone's participation on our conference call, and we look forward to finishing up 2014 strong. And we'll talk to you all in January. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 31, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO for Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2014 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Executive Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014. In short, we had a strong second quarter and our results exceeded our expectations. During the second quarter, we saw an extension of many of our first quarter themes: solid global beverage can demand with healthy year-over-year growth in Europe, Asia and Brazil and firmer demand in North America; lower operating costs in our European beverage can segment and continued strong cost management in our North American as well as Asian beverage can businesses; continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America; strong performance in our European and Mexican impact-extruded businesses from both a volume and cost perspective; strong aerospace program execution; and ongoing disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy from all drove our results. North American tinplate container volumes were lower than expected and, operationally, we continue to have some operational challenges that we discussed on our first quarter conference call. Some of it is related to the repositioning of certain manufacturing equipment across the domestic food and household segment footprint, and some of it is a bit self-inflicted as we have taken steps -- and we have taken steps to get it back on the right track for 2015 and beyond. While some previously disclosed segments still exist in the back half of '14, including persistent LME premium in Europe, the aforementioned manufacturing inefficiencies in our food and household products division, and tougher second half volume comps, it's evident that 2014 is shaping up to be a better year than 2013. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our second quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Excuse me, I'm fighting a bit of a cold this morning. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $1.13 versus last year's $0.85. In addition to John's comments around better year-over-year global beverage can volumes and cost-out progress, a lower share count contributed to our improved results. During the first half of the year, we acquired net $239 million of our stock and returned another $37 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And presently, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, again, no significant changes to our previous financial metrics. Free cash flow is expected to exceed $550 million, share buybacks will be in the range of $500 million, CapEx around $375 million, with it being more back-end weighted. Interest expense should be around $163 million and our effective tax rate for the full year should be in the range of 28%. On a full year basis, corporate undistributed should be closer to $80 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.4 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.6x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.7x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Moving to operations. Our metal beverage, Americas and Asia, segment comparable earnings were up more than $15 million in the second quarter. Year-over-year benefits from cost-out programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results. In the quarter, North America volumes were up due to our customer waiting to beer and continued growth in specialty, while volumes in Brazil and China were both up mid-teens in the quarter, due to higher can penetration for beer packaging. European segment profit was up roughly $22 million in the second quarter due to mid-single-digit volume growth and the benefits of reduced costs, which will continue to flow through the segment in 2014 and into 2015. As John briefly touched on, between our previously disclosed second half LME premium headwind of roughly EUR 7 million and tougher second half volume comparisons, our ongoing cost savings initiatives should offset these headwinds in the back half of the year. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down approximately $8 million in the quarter, as low-single-digit segment volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies in North America, which John mentioned earlier, dampened the results. Rest assured that the food and household team has a plan to align tinplate supply with demand in North America while wrestling with the current plant performance headwind to ensure that we are well-positioned going into 2015. In summary, our global beverage operating team continues to execute in tight supply/demand situations across the majority of its manufacturing portfolio, while also managing capital projects in North America and Europe to further improve our packaging business in 2015 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continues to exceed expectations. Solid execution and higher work fees on existing programs, successful deliveries and niche product wins for antennas and sensors are some of the highlights. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at 580 -- excuse me, $858 million, and as mentioned on our January call, we are pursuing some large programs that are expected to be awarded late this year or early next year. We do have a significant launch coming up for the WorldView-3 satellite by DigitalGlobe later in August, and so far, things look good here. Now looking out across our company today. We are proud of our year-to-date results and the teamwork it took to accomplish them. Though some challenges still exist, we will control what we can control and effectively manage through the rest. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond while growing both our EVA dollars and free cash flow. And with that, Nelson, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.
Mark Wilde: I wondered, on bev cans in Europe, is it possible, Scott, to quantify the benefit you got from just no more drag from the switch of headquarters that you were dealing with last year? And then I wondered if you could also provide a little color on that expansion in the Netherlands?
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. The -- I think the Europe benefited from nice volume gains in the quarter. If you remember, year-over-year, volumes were a lot tougher in the first half of last year. This year, they've been better. They're getting the benefits of cost-out, some of the cost-out programs that they've been putting in place. So I think there's really not much of a drag anymore from the European headquarter's relocation. And then we're getting the benefit of the -- on the tax rate side, we're making more money in Europe, which has lower tax rates, so that's helping us. The second part of your question was about the Netherlands' expansion, and that is moving along and we expect to have that capacity up for the busy season next summer.
Mark Wilde: And that's all committed volume at this point?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we have a variety of contracts to take that volume.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. First question, just wanted to make sure I heard correctly. Aluminum premium is expected to be a EUR 7 million headwind in 2H in Europe? And do you expect a price recovery in 2015 as a result?
Scott C. Morrison: To the first part, yes. The premium that we expect, the headwind is about EUR 7 million in the second half of the year. We had a little of that in the second quarter, but only maybe about EUR 1 million. In terms of price recovery, it's too early to talk about what pricing looks like for 2015, but obviously, if our price -- or if our costs are going up at some point, you need to recover that through the system.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. And I know the press release talked about a plant fire in the Americas. Just being it's the peak season right now, is there any worries about supply as a result?
Scott C. Morrison: Our people did a phenomenal job. We did have a fire in Monticello, Indiana really at the peak time of shipping. And through the great work that they did, they were able to get that plant up and running in different pieces over a period of just a few weeks. And throughout our system of people doing really phenomenal work, we really didn't miss a beat. So due to the great work of our people, it really was less of a financial impact, but tremendous work by our people.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. And just one last one. Just wanted an update on the supply and demand balance in China, and if you have any initial thoughts on pricing for 2015 out there?
Scott C. Morrison: We're hopeful that pricing would stabilize. There's still a lot of -- there's probably 20% excess supply. We're sold out so we're running kind of hand and mouth in terms of our selling them what we can produce. So we're pretty tight. But it is a much more seasonal market, too. Even though there is 20% overcapacity in total, finding cans at the peak time is a bit tough. And I think it's a little too early to tell in terms of pricing in China, but hopefully we've seen kind of the bottom. Things that we've seen recently, it doesn't look like it's materially changing from where it's at right now.
John A. Hayes: The only thing I'd add is the market continues to grow very strongly there. Mid-double digits, 15%, 17%, which obviously helps to soak up some of that excess supply. I think as we said on our last call that some of the smaller, more regional players continue to put some more capacity in. But I think the tone and tenor of building plants versus making money has changed slightly towards the positive in terms of looking to make money and make returns.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a few interconnected question on Brazil and Latin America. Can you talk a little bit about the pack mix change to more one-way during the World Cup. What are you hearing from your customers as far as retaining that shift impact mix? What do you think is going to happen with the impact of the demand from a possible beer tax coming later in the year? And then how should we be thinking about 2015, just off of a strong 2014 comparison?
John A. Hayes: That's a lot of questions there. I think the first one, in terms of the package mix, we continue to see growth in one-way packaging. The can as a percent of the beer mix is now 45%, 46%, that's up from 39%, 40%, I think, a year ago. So things continue to go strong there. I don't think it was only related to the World Cup because we've seen a consistent growth of that metric over time. Certainly, the World Cup had, on the margins, some positive. But there was also a lot of on-premise beer drinking in Brazil, which is not cans. It's more returnable glass. But I do think, overall, those trends that we've seen have continued. In terms of your question about the beer tax, we've talked about this before. They pushed it out on the last call. It was supposed to happen in June and now they're talking September, and it may not happen at all, so it's unclear. It would put a little bit of a headwind into it. But these things happen from time to time. What we're hearing is it's unclear whether it's going to be implemented or at what time, given the elections going on. We had a very strong first half of the year than the overall industry did from a volume perspective. Our plan -- our expectations are it's going to be much more muted, is the best way to say it, and it's going to be relatively flat is what we're planning on in the second half this year. Going in 2015, it's really as much about the economy, and the economy is not doing all that well. The elections are coming up. So it depends upon that. We certainly don't see any big upside or downside, relative to overall volumes. And so kind of relatively flat to up a couple of percent, if you'd ask us right now, it's probably what we'd say. But it is a bit premature to look into the crystal ball for 2015 down there.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up then on that. How sold out are you with your facilities in Latin America and Brazil, specifically, at this point?
Scott C. Morrison: We've got -- it's a very seasonal business there, as well. And we brought up a line -- the last line in the fourth quarter of last year. So I think from a supply standpoint, we've got kind of where we need to be. I don't think we're going to need to be adding any additional capacity. Again, it's a very seasonal business. So seasonally, you run really hard when it's summertime and you run a little bit less when it's not.
John A. Hayes: Yes. We currently have no plans to add any additional capacity, but our manufacturing focus right now is really to be as efficient as we can with those assets that we put in place and get more cans out of them. So I think over the next 12 to 18 months, you should expect that's really where our focus is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, starting off, maybe shorter term, talking about the food can business in North America. As you mentioned, and for a lot of reasons who already discussed in the past, earnings were down quite a bit. Is there a way to parse how much of the decline in earnings year-on-year was attributed to, say, your volumes being off, how much of it is just from higher cost to service you're realigning capacity ahead of '15 and how much of it was the self-inflicted? If you can get into any of that, that would be helpful, and I had some follow-ons.
John A. Hayes: Well, the best way -- I don't know if I can break it into those 3 buckets, but I can break it into these 2 buckets. I think, from a volume decline, 1/3 of the decline in profits came from volume and 2/3 came from the manufacturing side and whether that was -- it was a relocation of the assets, as well as the self-inflicted -- we just haven't been executing as well as we would've liked in terms of these movements, and it's going to take some time to cycle through. So that's -- George, that's one of the reasons why we said, in the second half of this, we're going to see -- continue to face see some of these headwinds. But I think as we go into 2015, we're laser-focused on making sure these issues are corrected.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, on the volume, is this market or is this related to the contract that's ultimately coming up, I would have thought then have an impact in 2015?
John A. Hayes: Yes. No, it's market related. We're down a couple of a percent, I think, as we said. The packs have started a little bit late, but they seem to be -- it depends on where you're talking, but they seem to be going okay, but I wouldn't read anything into it other than we are off a couple percent just because, remember the first quarter, the weather was bad and I think even in the early part of the first half of the second quarter, the weather wasn't all that great. So it's kind of pushed the packs out a little bit. But I wouldn't read anything other than that.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's fair. I guess my last question on food, and again, you did very well everywhere else, so I apologize, I'm focusing mostly on where the performance wasn't as great this quarter. If we consider the volume effect in '15 as the contract comes off, but then the recovery, from an operating standpoint, from the realignment and then getting back, perhaps, on the performance relative to where you've had some missteps, do you think earnings in food next year are down versus '14? Or might you be flat to up because of the improvement in operations?
John A. Hayes: I think flat to up would be a big stretch as we sit here right now. But I do think that they'll be down slightly, but it's really a function of how much we can approve the manufacturing side of the business here. We've talked about as we go into the second half of this year that we're going to be looking at executing on our plans that we already have in place to optimize our business going into '15. So I think there are some puts and takes as you think about '15. One of the positive things is we should get better manufacturing performance.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. One last one, John, I'll turn it over, and really more for Scott. Realizing that it's not '15 yet and it's hard to provide a CapEx forecast, since a lot of your projects seem to be back-end weighted off Myanmar, the spending this year, my guess, is a little bit more back-end loaded as well. Would the project spending spill over into '15 and therefore make it more likely that capital spending is up from 2014 or should we not draw that conclusion?
Scott C. Morrison: I don't know, George. It's probably too early to call. There's definitely -- the capital has been slower than what we expected it to be flowing out this year. And we'll see what we get done in the second half of this year. But we typically have some amount of carry-out capital and carry-in capital, year-over-year, and it's really too early to call. And it's also, frankly, dependent on the opportunities that we have. So too early to tell what '15 will be. I have a hard-enough time judging next quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question I have is actually let's jump over to aerospace. John, you mentioned that there are some initiatives, I guess, from proposals that are out there that you guys are kind of aiming to get a piece off in late '14 and '15. Are these sort of contracts could make the business a lot bigger or are they more to kind of keep the business the size it is right now?
John A. Hayes: No, I think it's more growth, look to growth. We just are aware of a fair number of different program proposals that will be put out for bid in the second half of this year that had kind of fallen to our sweet spot. So as we think about that, whether we win them this year or next year, or whether they will be awarded this year or early next year, it's unclear at this time because some of the request for proposals aren't even out yet. But we do see those types of things and I think it will help to grow our business.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then I might have missed this. But in the Americas segment, could you give us a little bit of detail between how specialty did versus standard? And even within standard, sort of what was the difference between beer and non-beer?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think I'll take a crack at it. I know our specialty can growth was up high-single digits. And so by definition, our standard container were probably down a little bit. When you look at beer versus soft drink as an industry and as -- beer was up a few percent, soft drink was down a few percent. And so I think those kind of trends that we've talked about in the pass where the can is taking share, the package mix of beer continues to go strong. The beer market is relatively stable and solid, and on the soft drink side, they have some challenges in terms of volume and I think the can is feeling it. So those are the overall headlines.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And then I guess the last question, just really more on a -- I guess from a qualitative perspective. When you think about the aluminum premium that you're paying in Europe, that's something that I would imagine wasn't anticipated when you did your contracts because it seems like that we've seen contracts in Europe, as well as North America, kind of have as a precondition almost to work. That volatility in aluminum is borne by the customer and yet here that's not occurring. So why would there not be a sort of a change in the contracts just too kind of keep that kind of rule of thumb that we've been seeing for the last few years?
Scott C. Morrison: The pricing in Europe has always been a little bit different, but I think you're exactly right. I think the premiums that we're experiencing now, at some point, need to flow through the system. So it's always been a little bit less connected than it has been in North America and other markets. But you could see -- I mean if we're paying double the premium this year versus where we were 6, 9 months ago, at some point you need to get that back.
John A. Hayes: And I think one of the issues, the premium historically had been relatively stable and so people never really thought about these big deviations that have been seen. So your point is spot on, that I think as we look at contracts going forward, that's one of the things that we're certainly going to be trying to address.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And I know maybe this is not a fair question, but is it possible that premium could go down and you could actually benefit, say, next year if it's not -- if the volatility is not written out of the contracts?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I think you'd have year-over-year comps that are easier, but I'm not sure it's going to go -- we would be hopeful that it would go back to more normalized level, but I'm not sure it's going to go much further than that.
John A. Hayes: Yes and we think irrespective of the changes at the LME's rules, it's going to take some time for this to wind down, the premium changes to kind of flow through the system, just because the way the whole system works.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a follow-up on North American specialty cans. It sounds like volumes were strong. If you were to look at specialty can margins, would you describe those as up year-over-year? Are they stable or is there any pressure there? And I think, on the last call, you referenced potentially a line addition in specialty cans in North America in the second half, if there's any update on that?
John A. Hayes: Yes. The -- I would say, again, we talk about specialty as almost like one type of package, but it's 20 or 25 different sizes and shapes. I think from a profitability perspective, we really haven't seen any change in that. We do have some plans that we really can't talk about in terms of putting a specialty container opportunity in North America that we're moving forward on. And that will be up and running sometime next year, so that's the only update I can provide.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Okay. And is it possible to give capacity figures for the Holland and the Myanmar lines?
John A. Hayes: Typically, when you add a new line, for example, on existing facility, you get, depending on the speed and other things, 750 million to 900 million cans, plus or minus, so it's going to be in that range. And then in Myanmar, it really is more about the demand of Myanmar than it is about the capacity. We expect to be up and running in excess of a 0.5 billion cans in Myanmar. And as we go forward, we'll continue to incrementally build out that line to provide more capacity.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one last one. I mean, we've seen some undisciplined supply behavior by Chinese producers within China. As you look at Southeast Asia as an attractive opportunity, are you seeing Chinese competitors look at that market or maybe put capacity into that market that doesn't necessarily make sense or is concerning to you? Or how do you think about the threat of Chinese producers in Southeast Asia?
John A. Hayes: Well we have seen a little bit, but not wholesale. In Vietnam, there's a Chinese producer that's manufacturing there and some other areas we look from time to time. It's certainly not as acute as in China itself. But there's other competitors as well, whether the Japanese, or whether even some European competitors that have been looking over there. So it's -- I would say the overcapacity and the thought around that is not as acute as it historically had been in China, but it's certainly a competitive world.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Bev can demand in North America was pretty encouraging in the first half. Are you seeing that momentum carryover into 3Q? And how has the promotional activity track thus far?
John A. Hayes: Well in terms of continuing it, and we're only, what, 3 or 4 weeks into the third quarter and we haven't seen any appreciable change in the demand profile, I would describe the promotional activity as kind of average. As I said earlier, the beverage -- excuse me, beer cans were up, soft drink cans were done a little bit. And I think that kind of nears the overall industry for both those categories. And so we did see some 4th of July, some promotional activity, but I would just describe it as average.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then it looks like one of your competitors is looking to add some capacity in the specialty can side in Europe and North America. Any concern of saturation in that market as you bring on your plant in the Netherlands? And I guess you are looking to add some capacity as well next year in North America?
John A. Hayes: No. Because, as you all know, typically, when we add capacity, it's on the back of customer contracts. And so we feel good about the capacity additions we're putting in.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in China, it was pretty impressive that you were able to run your plants that hard. I would've thought your plants are running pretty full at this point. Can you talk about some of the initiatives that you have placed to unlock more capacity and is that double-digit type trajectory sustainable as we head into next year, if there is demand?
John A. Hayes: Well we are, as Scott mentioned, hand to mouth in Asia. And our folks have been doing a good job, but it's -- and anytime you're hand to mouth, it creates inefficiencies from a logistics perspective because you're shipping cans all over the place. We are -- while we have no specific things to talk about right now. We do have to look about capacity in Asia, but we're not going to do anything unless we can make economic returns. And so as this oversupply exists, but at the same time, the growth continues very strongly, we're looking at ways of getting more of our existing system. And then if we have to add incremental capacity, because generally speaking, particularly in the South of China, is where we're short of cans.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And then just one last final one. The aluminum producers have continued to shift more production into auto and aerospace. Have you taken any initiatives to lock up supply longer term?
Scott C. Morrison: We've -- there's been a lot of talk about the automotive business, and it remains to be seen where that's going to go. It depends on the customer what the customer wants to do, really, and how long they want to go on their contracts. There hasn't been any appreciable change in how we're contracting for aluminum or what we're doing.
John A. Hayes: Yes. The only thing I'd add as well is, remember, the North American market is not exclusively but largely a soft hole market. And so the contracting of the rolled aluminum is often done by some of our major customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just with Europe, I was wondering -- in terms of taking out costs, could you provide just a little more detail, I guess, on how much you've achieved as of now in relation to your goals and how much sort of is left potentially.
Scott C. Morrison: I think we're making a pretty good progress. And part of it is small often depreciation for projects that had kind of run through their life. But a lot of it is efficiencies that we're getting out of running the business as a Pan-European business out of Zürich. And I think there's more to go in terms of manning and efficiency. But right now, I'd say we're on track with where we hope and thought we would be, but I think there's more to go.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just a follow-up on the premiums. I mean if European premiums remained where they are now, I guess would there be any incremental hit as you head into 2015?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, you'd have a tougher comp in the first half of '15, but since they've been elevated in the second half of '14, that would balance out.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then I guess sort of just last question. I know on U.S. bev cans, you've kind of benefited from the closures in the previous 2 quarters. Is there still room to reduce cost there or is that kind of the cost space roughly where you think it should be?
John A. Hayes: Well I think from a footprint perspective, if that's where you're going to, I think we're comfortable with where we are right now. But our folks continuously focus on taking inefficient costs out of the system, and we've been spending a lot of time on the freight and logistics side, the whole warehousing side, there's a lot of opportunity to optimize that. And so our folks have done a wonderful job, and it's part of the mantra. It's just to continue trying to cost-out. But from a manufacturing footprint perspective, we have no plans to do anything other than what we're doing right now.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And those savings from the previous closure have lapsed as of the second quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a few questions on Europe -- I know you kind of talked around this a bit, but can you just comment on the sustainability of the 13% EBIT margin? I mean I know that you're going to see some premium headwinds in the back half, but it just seems like you previously had said 11% to 12%, so it was a little bit better than I was anticipating.
John A. Hayes: Yes. If -- remember, when you go back and look over the past number of years, there's a seasonality aspect of it. And our margins are usually a little bit higher in the second and third quarters relative to the first and second. So when we were talking about that 11.5%, 12.5%, that was really on a full year basis.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That makes sense. And then, again, do you expect, with the situation in Russia and the Ukraine, that you might see some fallout of volume basically making its way into other Eastern European markets that might typically go in that direction?
John A. Hayes: I don't think anything appreciably. We don't think too much about Russia, because Russia's, from a logistics point of view, is very far away from the other parts of Europe. And Ukraine, I know that there is one plant in Ukraine and -- but the overall Continental European market has been regionally strong. And so when you're talking about a base of $50 billion and it's growing mid-single digits, that's a couple of can lines a year. And so we don't -- if your question is around -- or you're concerned that things from the east may move to the west and it's going to put pricing pressure on it, I just don't think, on the margin, there may be some cans going there, but it's not going to have enough of an impact.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just my last question is have you guys made any decisions on leadership in the metal beverage business?
John A. Hayes: Well we're taking our time. As you see, we're performing very well and we're having conversations about that, but we have made -- to answer your question, no, we've not made any decisions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to kind of hone in on a couple of areas if I could. One being as -- recognizing you guys are very, very disciplined, when you go to put capital in you don't build a lot of spec capacity or do things of that nature. But -- and you go about that the right way. So when you put a new capacity or you're in the process of putting new capacity in the Netherlands, in example, given some of the premium issues, can you use that as an opportunity to -- and appreciating you don't want to talk in too much detail about contracts, but can you use that as an opportunity to maybe change some of the mechanics of how you do contracts to protect yourself from things like LME premiums and things of that nature? Or do you kind of have to follow industry dynamics and then work as a whole. Maybe a little color would be helpful.
John A. Hayes: Well, I don't know. I think they're a bit separate. I hear where you're going with that in terms of how to use this capacity as leverage. We're sold out in Europe right now, in fact, we're real tight in Europe right now, and so we need the capacity to come on. How you negotiate contracts with customers, I think, is separate and apart from that. And it's a competitive world. So if we were trying to do certain things in competition or not, we'd have to deal with that. So that's the way we think about it.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And then the second, you said that you are pretty in a spot where you're sold out and tight in China, we've heard some discussion here and there about some incremental capacity or someone looking to potentially add a facility in I think the in the Weilin area, could you comment on your appetite, as it sits today, given that you're full and seemingly running at okay returns to potentially add capacity?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think I mentioned this earlier. We are looking at that. We have nothing to announce right now. But again, we are sold out in Asia, and as the market continues to grow mid-double-digit to teens, 15%, 17%, we want to capture our fair share of that but only do it if we can be economically sustainable, and our folks have done a very good job of -- from a cost perspective and a capital perspective of making sure that we're low-cost there. And so, stay tuned on what some of our plants are, but we're looking at various things.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And then just the last question I had was when we look at kind of your opportunity here in North America in that tinplate business, I think you've -- in the past, you've talked about looking for ways or options to try to replace some of that lost EBIT that would be from the contract move. As you sit today, you haven't made any other capacity announcements, whether it's adds in different areas. Can you maybe share where you're at in the process? Is that something still you're working on and you'll share with us in the future? Or have you thought about adding, whether it's different products or different components, aside from moving around some volumes?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Well, I think we mentioned this on our first quarter call, but we expect it, come late summer early fall, to know where we stand relative to this loss of the business and whether or not they require assistance going forward. I think you should expect that we have plans in place and that we're going to be executing on them in the second half to optimize our business for the expected customer loss. Some of it includes -- I would not say we are going out in trying to look for new business just to "buy" business. We're looking at various costs initiatives. We're looking at various new product initiatives as well. And you should expect to hear some of those in the second half of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Looking at the total EBITDA for the business in the second quarter, it looks like it's up about $34 million. Is it possible to parse out how much of that $34-million improvement is productivity and sort of how you think about the productivity number in the back half of the year, what that number typically is in a given year from a planning perspective?
Scott C. Morrison: There's always a variety of -- we don't parse it like that. But I mean the improvement is across the board, across the beverage business, from volume improvements and cost-outs. It's a variety of things. So it's a pretty strong operating quarter.
John A. Hayes: Yes. I mean, I think it's the only -- I'm with Scott. I don't think we parse it out the way you think about it, but you'll go segment-by-segment and you look at the margin improvement, I think we're up in every category, except the food and household for the reasons we've talked about before. So we've had great operating performance and we've had a much more normalized constructive demand situation as well.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then in China, I think we had talked about in the past that you'll be able to grow operating earnings there this year, even though the pricing environment is tough. Are you still on track to accomplish that and can you sort of provide order of magnitude on what you think China operating earnings will up in '14?
John A. Hayes: Well, we never really get into that. But I do think that we have some volume improvements. We have -- as I said, we have a little bit higher costs because the volumes have been so strong we've had to move cans all over the place. And we also even have some currency headwinds with the volume improvements as well as the cost-out on the manufacturing side I think are more than offsetting certainly the -- some of those other headwinds.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, John. Just last question. So your leverage ratios are moving lower even though you're not paying down that, given EBITDA's growing. So is there potential to perhaps buy back above the free cash flow number, so north of $0.5 billion given your leverage is moving lower?
John A. Hayes: We look at it all the time in terms of how much stock we're going to buy back. The guidance I gave you on the call earlier of we expect to use most of the -- all that free cash flow to buy back stock and pay dividends. That's kind of where we are right now.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.
Mark Wilde: Yes. I've got just few short ones. John, can you give us some sense of what kind of growth you're seeing in that craft beer business right now. I think you've got most of the can business in that market.
John A. Hayes: Yes. It continues to grow very strong, just a data point on that. The can as a share of the package mix in craft is now right around 10%, and that's a great testament to the work done largely by the business development folks. And so we continue to see very strong growth from the craft side. It's still not -- it's not a huge part of our overall portfolio, but the growth in it is still quite strong, and we expect that to continue. There's been a number of craft brewers, they've been putting in new breweries in the Southeast region, and I think as we think about the capacity there, as well as them putting new can lines, and we're seeing good growth there.
Mark Wilde: Yes. I mean what would guess your penetration would have been in that market 3 years ago, would it have been like 5% or even below that?
John A. Hayes: Less. Less than 5%. I would be speculating, but I guess 2% to 3%. It's been growing strongly.
Mark Wilde: Yes. All right. So you're growing relative to the market. The second one I had, just with kind of conflicts picking up globally, is there any impact in all of that for Ball Aerospace as you look forward over the next 3 or 4 years?
John A. Hayes: The short answer is there very well could be, but it's -- I really can't comment on that. When you think about -- the geopolitical environment is such that there is regional conflicts everywhere, and I think information and surveillance and reconnaissance around that is really important, and I think those are some of the strategic opportunities we may have in front of us.
Mark Wilde: Okay. About half of that business is defense, is that right?
John A. Hayes: Approximately, yes.
Mark Wilde: Yes. Okay. And then the last one I had is just for Scott. I noticed that the repurchase activity this quarter was the lowest that we've seen since the second quarter of 2010. I just wondered whether we should read anything into that?
Scott C. Morrison: No. I actually didn't know that. But -- usually, we try to buy -- I mean, frankly, we buy pretty heavy in the first quarter of the year. In the second quarter, we probably have more moderate pace, so you shouldn't read anything into that.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to pick up on one of the question I think Chris had started in. And you've teed up given your comments on Asia and China in particular. So if you have a market that is, well, if you have a customer base and a supply chain of your own that's sold out, and we have acknowledged in the past you've discussed the fact that prices had nothing where you would have liked them to be. And you're still making economic profit when prices aren't where you like them to be. You're suggesting that the next move should be potentially to add a can plant in China, and I was wondering how you, if that wound up being the eventuality, how you would be able to preserve or turn to a contract where certainly in the last few years because of market factors, not your own, it's been less good of a market than you would've liked. So differently, given your sold-out position, want opportunity you have to have instead of growing capacity, but rather using your sold-out position to optimize your customer mix?
John A. Hayes: Yes. And, George, those are all fair points. The way we kind of think about it is, #1, China is such a large country. And so you have to look at the regional differences. So that's point 1. Pricing has come down, and as Scott mentioned it has stabilized. Point 3 is our folks over the last 2 years have done a very good job, focused intently on making sure we're low costs from an operating perspective and from a capital perspective. And so if we were to be thinking about capital going forward, I think it's on an optimized capital base at a much lower cost basis. And the question is, at the current pricing, can you make economic returns with that? And if the answer is yes, then you consider it. If the answer is no, then it gets into how do you improve either 1 of those 3 further from where you are today. That's the way we think about it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's fair. And gets me to one of the other questions that I had. I mean relative to where the industry was back in the mid-1990s, the beverage can business had become actually very good business for a lot of reasons. You are currently earning a lot more economic profit, both as a company, as an industry, than had been the case, given our mix. But that also brings a challenge because it attracts capital. So what do you believe to be, if you can't get into the number, that's a question about productivity. One of the ways you keep out that capacity is by always improving your own cost position. To what degree do you think you can improve your productivity and cost relative to the industry in total, especially in the growth markets like in Europe or Asia? Where do you think your productivity is leading the market by?
John A. Hayes: Well, again, I think we've talked about this in the past. The way that we look at it is, let's just pick on China, there are a number of smaller, more regional ones that are publicly traded and you're able to go and look at their public financial statements and we're able to do that and compare them with ours. And we see that scale matters in our business. And we see that we can bring the global perspective to issues at a regional level. And so if we're having some operational issues in a particular plant in China, it's not just the people in the plant that can deal with it, we can bring to bear some of our experts around the world to help them on that. Some of the regional guys don't have that. So what that ultimately creates is a scale issue where we can see it in the financial statements that our returns and margins are better than some of the local regional guys.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's fair. I'll drop that line for now. I guess the last question I had and I'll turn it over. Realizing that this maybe isn't the most realistic scenario because you're going to win contracts and your backlog is going to get better, but assuming these contracts don't come in quite the way you'd expect, when would we begin to see your margins in aerospace begin to fade? Right now, it's very rich because of where you are in terms of the contract terms, the life of contracts and so on. Would that be a third quarter or of fourth quarter event? Good luck in the quarter, feel better, Scott.
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks.
John A. Hayes: I don't think it's necessarily a step change function quarter-over-quarter, but I do think that we've been -- in the first half of this year, and you've seen it both the first and the second quarter, we've been doing very well as we've closed out some of these programs. I mentioned that we have the WorldView-3 launch coming up in a couple weeks. We delivered that in the second quarter, and so that de-risked much of it and we were able to get some benefit there. I think as we go into the third quarter and fourth quarter, you should not expect as much of that as you saw in the first and second quarter. And then when it comes to the rebuilding that backlog, whether it's fourth quarter this year, whether it's first quarter next year, it's not -- we don't necessarily think about it as a point in time. But there's a number of opportunities for chasing that are going to be awarded in that timeframe. And that, hopefully, we'll start to build the backlog back again and then we'll go through this other cycle of starting the contracts and then performing as we go.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking to you in October. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 1, 2014. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Jasmine, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2014 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company's news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now before I begin my formal comments today, I'd like to thank everyone on the call and many others for the support, caring and understanding during the loss of both of our friends and colleagues, Gerrit Heske and Ray Seabrook. Many of you know them, and words cannot describe the outpouring of support from our family here at Ball, our customers, our suppliers, shareholders and competitors. Thank you. We will move forward as they would want us to and build upon the legacy of excellence that they have helped create and perpetuate. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Like many here at Ball, Scott has also stepped up and is acting as Interim Chief Operating Officer for our global beverage can business. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014. Our first quarter results came in nicely ahead of expectations. The momentum we carried into the year continued across all of our businesses throughout the quarter, truly a testament to all of the hard work put in by our people here at Ball. Excellent cost management across our global packaging businesses, volume growth in Europe and Brazil, continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America, key aerospace program deliveries and our disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy drove these results. During the first quarter, we experienced much more constructive beverage can volume throughout most regions of the world than we had seen in the first part of last year. We further improved operating costs in our European segment, and we saw continued growth for beverage cans in the region. We are proud of the work our European beverage team has accomplished at both the plant level, as well as the support functions. We continued to experience strong demand in Brazil, which contributed favorably to the results as preparation for the 2014 World Cup and Carnival extended the summer selling season. North America tinplate container volumes were lower-than-expected in the seasonally slow quarter. And operationally, we got off to a slower start than we would have liked. Scott will go into that in more detail in a minute. And aerospace, for the second year in a row, was awarded Boeing's Avionics Supplier of the Year award. Out of a total of 14,000-plus suppliers that service Boeing, this is yet another example of our close-to-our-customer focus as part of who we are. As we entered the year, we believe that 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013, and the first quarter helped to reinforce this. We're experiencing good global beverage can volumes versus this time last year. Our focused efforts to identify pockets of growth and manage our cost structure are bearing fruit. Both will drive EPS growth, EVA dollar generation and strong and consistent cash flow in 2014 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.81 versus last year's $0.58. In addition to John's comments around better year-over-year global beverage can volumes and cost-out progress, a lower share count contributed to our improved results. During the quarter, we acquired a net $194 million of stock and returned another $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And presently, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, no big changes to our previous financial metrics. Free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $550 million; share buybacks around $500 million; CapEx around $375 million, with it being more back-end loaded; interest expense at about $163 million; effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 29%; and full year corporate undistributed is now expected to be closer to $80 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.6 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remain solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 5.2x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.9x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were up roughly $20 million in the first quarter. Year-over-year benefits from cost-out programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results. In the quarter, North America volumes continued to be sluggish for standard cans in the carbonated soft drink category. However, cans for beer were up and Brazil volumes were up strong double-digits. Our China volumes were off slightly due to capacity constraints and some regional supply demand issues, though excellent plant performance and efficiencies ensure that our China business continues to generate positive EVA dollars. European segment profit was up roughly $25 million in the first quarter due to mid-single digit volume growth and the benefits of reduced costs. Food and household comparable segment earnings were up slightly in the quarter as mid-single digit volume declines for tinplate containers in North America were offset by mid-single digit volume increases in Europe for extruded aluminum containers. More recently, we have seen some modest price cost compression in the U.S. food and household segment, which will impact us as we move through the balance of 2014. We also were impacted by incremental manufacturing efficiencies due to weather, inventory adjustments and plant performance. In summary, our beverage operating team is doing an excellent job meeting outsized demand in Brazil and favorable demand in Europe, while at the same time, we are preparing for continued manufacturing projects in North America and Europe to further improve our packaging businesses. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business performed very well in the quarter. Solid execution and higher award fees on existing programs, successful deliveries and launches and recognition of our aerospace team's performance not only with Boeing, but with other customers were some of the highlights. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter was $868 million and, as I mentioned on our January call, we are pursuing several large programs that are expected to be awarded by year end. During the quarter, the Ball-built GMI instrument was successfully launched from Japan and began collecting science data on the Earth's rain and snowfall. Also, the Ball-built Kepler satellite, NASA's first mission to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, marked its fifth year anniversary of planet hunting. And so far, it has identified 715 new planets, quite an accomplishment in its own right. Now looking out across our business today. We are not without our challenges. The pricing environment in China has yet to improve. Our North American tinplate business has a bit more headwinds than we have had in the past and volume comps will likely normalize as we head into the back half of the year as the World Cup concludes and we lap a strong second half of 2013. However, and most of all, our business has stepped up and delivered. This quarter was one filled with personal loss and numerous business accomplishments. The term resilience comes to mind, and we are moving forward as a team. I am proud to be a Ball employee. Given the strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond, while growing our EVA dollars. And with that, Jasmine, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First off on Brazil, what do you estimate market growth was during the quarter? How much do you think was the World Cup? And on an underlying basis, what do you see occurring in the region? It seems like there's another beer tax being implemented. I guess, what are your customers saying in terms of demand expectations for the year?
Scott C. Morrison: Market in the first quarter was really strong. It was up high-teens. We were up more than that because, if you remember, we put in that new line in the fourth quarter of last year, so we grew about -- a little more than 10 points higher than the market in the first quarter. We are seeing very strong volumes and good growth in specialty cans. I'm a little nervous as to what happens after the World Cup. There seems to be a lot of momentum going into the World Cup. But we'll have to wait and see. And we have tougher comps in the second half because of that line.
John A. Hayes: And then also, Ghansham, I might just add, I think it was even yesterday, the Brazil Finance Ministry raised taxes on beer and soft drink effective June 1. And it's our understanding it will increase the price at the retail about 4% or 5%. And while this could have an impact on volumes in the second half, obviously, how much, it's too early to tell at this point in time. But we are a bit cautious about that in the second half.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Makes sense. And then on Europe, I know you had an easier comparison from a year ago, but was there anything unusual from an EBIT standpoint, if you kind of think about the year-over-year variance? And if you can isolate for us the cost savings impact year-over-year, that would be helpful.
Scott C. Morrison: It's really a combination. If you look at last year, in the first quarter, volumes were down a fair amount. This year, first quarter, our volumes were up nicely. That, combined with the cost-out programs, the combination of those 2 things, specialty can growth, stronger growth in Eastern Europe, all those things helped the first quarter. So it was a very strong quarter.
John A. Hayes: Yes, I might just add that in a fixed-cost business -- I think we talked about this before -- it's always difficult to separate the cost out from the volume impact, but we are on track relative to our cost-out programs that we've laid out in prior conference calls. And with the added benefit of some more constructive volume, I think that's what you saw.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Europe was off to a very strong start with the margins in that 12% ballpark already. I know it's a seasonally smaller quarter, but are you guys on track to hit that 12% margin target already for 2014 or should -- could you see some margin pressure with the metal premiums kicking in?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we do have some headwinds in the back half of the year from the metal premium that I talked about before to the tune of around EUR 6 million, if it stays where it is right now. I think what we said is, we expect to be kind of in that 11% to 12% range this year. But we're still working. The cost-out programs, as John mentioned, are on track and continue to progress and proceed, but we won't get the full benefit of that until we get into next year, frankly.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, noncontrolling line was up more than 50%. I assume that's mostly Brazil, but can you comment on that? And were there any -- were customers building inventory for the World Cup a little sooner than normal?
Scott C. Morrison: That's a good question. Yes, the answer to the increase in that line is mostly Brazil. And building to the advance of World Cup -- remember, they had a very good summer, so weather was very warm throughout their summertime. Carnival was late, which kind of extended the summer. So we've gotten a couple of benefits, plus then as we start to get into the World Cup. So I think, the combination of all those plus having an additional line that we didn't have last year at this time, all of those helped drive the results.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just one last final one. Beer demand in North America was quite strong, particularly for bev cans. Are you seeing that momentum spillover in 2Q? And I just wanted to get a little more color on that front because beer, I don't think, was that strong overall for the category. So are you outpacing the market from share gains or are you seeing a pack mix shift?
John A. Hayes: No, I think it's mostly a pack share or pack mix shift. The overall beer market actually was strong in the first quarter despite some of the weather. And I'm not talking just cans. But cans also continued to grow its share of the package mix within the beer category. Just a little statistic, we've talked about the craft beer industry and how the growth of cans has been helpful there, that the can as a share of the package mix is now in double-digit percent, where just 5, 6 years ago, we weren't selling any cans into that. So there's various trends going on like that, which have been very constructive in the beer category.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You referenced some price compression in food and household and some pressure in North American tinplate. And I'm wondering if you could quantify the pressure you saw in the first quarter and what you might expect for the remainder of the year and maybe give a little color on what's driving that?
John A. Hayes: Yes, well, what's driving it is, as most people know, I think to a degree, and we had anticipated this, that there's some new capacity coming onstream in North America. And I think it's certainly in the second half of the first quarter. As a result of some of this competitive activity, we've been nicked a bit going forward. We're going to be standing firm with respect to maintaining our customer base, but we've had to respond to some of the pricing extensions that others have done. But more importantly, I think, assets related to what we've already announced have been moving around. And that's been creating some disruption in our manufacturing footprint right now. And so as we look forward, I think we have some challenges, not only on the pricing side, but also on the manufacturing side that we need to get right. And then as you rightly pointed out, it's seasonally slow. And as we go into the pack, we had a pretty good pack last year, so it's unknown what the pack is going to look like this year. That those are the issues that weigh on our mind when we think about that segment.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to Americas bev. You referenced, I think, stable beverage volumes in North America. If I go back to last year, I think you had referenced double-digit volume declines in 12-ounce cans. So I was just wondering, if you look at your 12-ounce volumes, were they flat or up or down versus last year's comps? And generally, how did you feel about the demand for standard cans that you saw in the U.S. in 1Q given kind of an easier comp, but difficult weather. How do you [indiscernible].
John A. Hayes: Good question. Recall that last year, we had some higher declines in the industry due to a loss of some business a couple of years ago. And obviously, we don't have that now. I think the overall tone for standard cans in North America is a bit better today. Not wholesale better, but a bit better than it was this time last year. We did have some tough weather in the first quarter of this year. But having said that, the overall category was roughly flat, and I described it as specialty being up. And the standard cans, which make up the majority of it, being down slightly. But certainly not down the 4% to 6% as an industry that we had been seeing last year.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My question was really on -- first a follow-up on the North American metal food business. I just want to make sure in conjunction with the price compression, have you been able to link them to contracts and lock those customers in for longer periods of time? And second on that, I think when we talked last, you didn't think you were going to see this type of compression just given where your customers are located. Can you talk about maybe something that changed that led to this decision?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think, as we said in the first quarter, that we have a variety of contracts, number one. And what we saw as we went through the quarter is that some other customers and some other competitors that were looking up to lock up volume a little bit more longer term. And as a result of that, our discussions with our customers shifted just a little bit. And so we had to respond to a couple of certain situations. Obviously, when you're in discussions like that, you want to get something, if you have to give something. And so that's what -- whether it's contract length or other things like that. And so that's what we certainly had been focused on. And so, as I've said -- I wouldn't read into it wholesale. It's hurt a little bit, but not -- certainly for our corporation, it's not material, but we did see a little bit more activity than we had expected. We had expected it later on this year, but it just happened a little bit sooner, I think.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then when we look to the underlying demand trends in North America with CSD falling and sounds like you're picking up incremental wins, maybe with some small craft beers and whatnot in the beer category. When you look at your overall footprint in North America, are there some changes that would need to be made going forward if that mix continues to shift? Meaning beer outperforms CSD or can you serve the existing customers off your existing footprint?
John A. Hayes: I think the current trends that we saw in first quarter, and recall, it's only a quarter. So a trend doesn't make that. But if those trend -- type of trends continue, as we said in January, we feel pretty good about where our footprint is. We, over the last few years, have taken out a fair amount of capacity, and we've converted existing 12-ounce capacity to specialty. Some of the growth in beer is not only on 12-ounce, but it is also on specialty containers. But I do think just overall, when you take a step back relative to a year ago, the overall tone of the soft drink is a little bit better. The tone of beer, we have beer growth right now and can share penetration growth in the beer segment, so that's good. And then specialty off a bigger base continues to grow nicely. So I just think overall, as an industry, the tone feels a touch better. But again, we're also very cognizant that it was a seasonally slow first quarter.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last one on the North American carbonated soft drink market. Have you seen any signs of promotional activity from your customers or are we still sort of in this period of -- where they're trying to improve their margins and maybe not promoting as much? Have you heard anything?
John A. Hayes: I think actually in the first quarter, you saw a little bit more promotional activity than you would have seen in a first quarter in prior year. And I do think, as we've talked in the past, that the CSD customers are trying to optimize this value versus volume equation. And they also recognize that, given the elasticity of CSD and some of the health and wellness issues, that you just can't keep pushing price and expect volumes not to decline. And so we have seen a little bit more promotional activity, but it's way premature to talk about what type of promotional activity we'll see in the summertime.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I want to pick up on the promotional activity. I mean, we've heard from some of the case producers that there is, in fact, a bit more promotion in the soft drink side. Do you think that, that can continue given what looks to have been a little bit more success and a little more volume through retail channel for soft drinks?
John A. Hayes: Again, yes is the short answer to your question. We think there can be some more promotional activity. A lot of it has to do with weather and is more regional. I think what you're seeing -- we used to talk in the years past about promotional activity, and that sounded like it was a national opportunity. You're seeing much more promotional activity done at the very local level, and it's much more on the execution side of that. We have seen more of that certainly in the first quarter. I think we would expect to see a bit more of that as we go into the summer, but time will tell.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Next question. From my take on your commentary regarding North American food, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounded like you were somewhat disappointed in terms of your execution of your plans as far this year were perhaps being surprised by the activity being a little bit more front-loaded. Is that a fair assessment or is that off the mark? And realizing you can't comment too much on a forum like this, what could you tell us qualitatively about what you're doing to adjust going forward, both from a cost and from a contractual standpoint?
John A. Hayes: Well, first, with respect to some of the headwinds we're facing, we talked a little bit about the pricing side. But we are, as I mentioned, we do have a fair amount of assets related to a couple of plant closures, Elgin, Danville, we have announced in the past year. And candidly, getting the equipment installed and getting it running up to our specifications and expectations has gone a bit slower. And our manufacturing people are working extremely diligent to get that right. But that's just a fact as we sit here today. So that's created some disruption. I think as we go in a bit longer term, we expect that come late summer -- and we had mentioned on earlier calls that we expected to know what we would have to do from a capacity point of view by late spring or early summer, and that's probably been pushed out a month or 2 relative to our capacity adjustments in the second half of this year as a result of the loss of some customer business. But we full well know what we need to do, and it's really just a timing issue of when we begin to execute on that. And the competitor is raising the capacity in by the end of the year. And I think we want to make sure that our customer is being well served, and we want to do it in the right way in this transition. And so we'll probably have a much better view towards mid to late summer.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. John, one other on beverage and taking you back on one of the prior questions. Obviously, first quarter wasn't so bad in light of other quarters from an aggregate standpoint for the industry. Beer nearly bailed out soft drink, so to speak. But considering that traditionally there have been differences in end sizes between the 2, do you have -- if this trend continues, do you have to at least recapitalize on the end making side of your modules or you don't think that, that will be an issue that you can contend with or you have the flexibility on your end-making equipment to change end sizes?
John A. Hayes: Well, the short answer is, I don't think that is an issue we need to contend with. And we have enough flexibility that, that is not a thing that keeps us awake at night.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Last one, and I'll turn it over. The backlog on aerospace did decline. You had called out this year that you would be hoping to get some project wins. Obviously, that's coming later in the year. If you win your rightful share -- and I realize that's difficult to project, where do you see your backlog by the end of the year? What should we be marking to market in terms of good progress or not so good progress for Ball by the end of the year?
John A. Hayes: It's tough to say because, as I said, George, some of these contract wins are going to be in the end of the year. And we don't know if it's going to be December or January. So don't hold me to a number as of December 31. But if we win our fair share through this cycle of new wins, we should be up relative to where we had been 18 months ago.
Scott C. Morrison: But the booking of that -- George, the booking of that into the backlog, we can win something, but then it takes time to get everything back to where it would roll into our backlog. So that's what John is talking about. We may know we win it this year, but it may not show up in the backlog yet.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Would that be over $1 billion? I'm sorry Scott. Would that be over $1 billion if you get back to where you were 18 months ago?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. If we win our fair share. And we're, as I've said, about $870 million right now. It would be back over $1 billion.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: If I could follow up from right where George was at, talking about the aerospace business a little bit. I mean, appreciating that for us dumb packaging guys, we don't always understand the aerospace business as well as we should. And also appreciating that it can be a little more complicated understanding when payments come in for performance things that you can't always talk about. You're off to a fabulous start for the year. You are winning some new business, but it sounds like it takes a while. Could this look more like a, from an EBIT perspective, you're off to a good enough start, can it look like a 2013 year? Or does it look more like a 2012 year as you kind of look at or think about how this year is shaping up?
John A. Hayes: Well, just a couple of observations before I try and hit that head on. Our folks performed tremendously well. And we had a very strong quarter and a lot of it had to do with award fees because we are performing. And as you move along in the life cycle of any contract, and, as you know, we have hundreds of them, you de-risk the program, but you also get award fees because of your performance. And that's exactly what happened. It's also the reason why there's been a slow burn in terms of our backlog because as we either complete or move towards the completion of many of those bigger projects, that's where a lot of those award wins would likely occur. To answer your question, does it look more like 2012 or 2013? It's probably a little bit closer to '13 than it is to '12. And the reason why I say that is we've had some great success on the award fees. That can't happen every quarter. And so -- and given that we have the new programs that we're bidding on, we won't hear on many of these until later on this year. I think we're going to see "more normalized" 3 quarters of the year this year. And then depending on how those wins look, 2014, we'll have to recalibrate at that point in time.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's actually very...
John A. Hayes: Oh, I'm sorry. 2015, we recalibrate. I'm sorry.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. If I could switch gears a second and talk about the bev business over in Asia. Please remind us the sizing of your business, what you have in China versus some of the other regions in Southeast Asia. I think you had some capacity in Vietnam, et cetera. And the pricing and the return characteristics, are they markedly different, I'm guessing yes, between what you're seeing in China and what you are in other pieces and has there been any pressures in the other piece of the business as well? Or how do you -- how should we think about potential for improvement within China?
Scott C. Morrison: Why don't I start, then I'll turn it over to John. In terms of where we're at, remember, our Vietnam is a joint venture, so it doesn't flow -- those volume numbers don't flow through our numbers. We're still seeing nice growth in the market, but there is a lot of capacity, and so pricing is not getting any better. And so what we're doing is doing things that we control on our cost side, to take cost out of our business. And our guys are doing a great job of doing that. So our returns look decent. And it's just not as good as it used to be, not quite as much fun as it used to be, but it's still good. And I think we should -- we just don't see the pricing environment improving materially for this year, definitely. But we're doing the things that we control, and the market continues to grow. So that's a good thing as well.
John A. Hayes: Scott said in his prepared remarks that we're generating positive EVA dollars, so that must mean we're generating returns in excess of 9%, as you all know. The other thing, as Scott said, the volume -- industry volume has been growing quite strong. And we've talked about this in the past with all the overcapacity. How long will it take to -- for the growth to chew into that and create a more balanced supply-demand. The positive is on the demand side, the volumes have been growing strongly as an industry. I do still believe that there's some of those smaller competitors that are putting some incremental capacity in, not nearly as great as it was a couple of years ago, but there is still a bit incremental. But I do think that overall excess capacity is slowly getting smaller. And it's a function of how long it will take to get there, and it would be premature to speculate. I just know it's slowly getting better, but we haven't yet seen it in the pricing.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Last question along those lines, then I'll turn it over. Is there a marked difference between margin levels, profitability levels, what have you, between what is in China and what is outside of China as you look across Southeast Asia?
John A. Hayes: Not materially -- again, for us, as Scott mentioned, we have a joint venture in Vietnam and then we have a small equity interest in Thailand. And so we have, to a degree, a limited purview, but no is the short answer. We don't see any wholesale changes in what the profile of each of the businesses are.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. We have the advantage in China of having scale. That probably helps us more so than a place like Vietnam, but that would be the biggest difference.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: First question is, with the better-than-expected first quarter and maintaining the guidance for the full year, how much of a factor was the announced beer tax in Brazil factoring in, in your decision to maintain the outlook despite the very strong 1Q?
John A. Hayes: Well, we had always said that we -- in the second half of the year down in Brazil, that we expected it to be more muted just because of the 2 summer season we've talked about: the extended Carnival, the World Cup. And so the announced beer tax, obviously, has incremental headwinds on it. But I don't think it necessarily fundamentally changed our view as a corporation on what our 2014 would look like.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. I appreciate that. I think I believe the headquarters in Germany recently closed and, Scott, I was wondering if, perhaps, you could help us maybe size up what the incremental cost savings in Europe beverage might be this year from that recent event? I know there's an indication that the full savings probably doesn't occur until next year, but I imagine you're probably going to get something incremental this year from that.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, just to be clear, the headquarters didn't close. The headquarters moved to Zürich a couple of years ago. We consolidated a couple of office locations that we had in Germany into one. And so with that, there is a reduction in the number of people that we'll have. We've never quantified the dollar amount. What we've talked about is margins getting back to that historical level that we had a few years ago in that business. And we're on track with that, and we're on track with all those plans. So as we move through the year, we'll continue to get the cost-out benefits. And again, in the first quarter, you see the leverage of cost out, but also volume growth. Volume is a wonderful thing in this business when it grows. So we expect to have a solid year in Europe, and it will continue to be decent as we move through the year in terms of achieving those cost-out programs.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. So I guess maybe if I can ask it another way, from -- is there incremental cost savings that has occurred with some of those office closures? Is there some incremental cost savings that will have occurred this year that hadn't yet been seen in the first quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we expect our cost structure at the end of this year to be lower than it is at the beginning of this year.
John A. Hayes: Yes, and just I think to Scott's point, Al, just part of it is the consolidation of these German administrative offices. As you know, we have a couple of other projects going on. And so as we move through the second half of last year and as we move through all of this year, we are taking the necessary plans. Just one of them happened to be in the first quarter, late first quarter, is when the 2 German facilities consolidated.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's helpful. And then my final question is just on carbonated soft drinks in the U.S. And it looks as if the overall volume trend of carbonated soft drinks is declining a little bit less than the cans are. And I was wondering how you are thinking about the can share within carbonated soft drinks, if there's any additional share -- if there's any appreciable share shift that you're seeing within that as well?
John A. Hayes: The short answer is, I don't think we see any appreciable share difference. I do know that the 2-liter PET was promoted a decent amount in the first quarter. But again, the first quarter is the most seasonably slow. And so that question is better debated come the fall when you actually can see a full year of the summer months related to cans as a share of the package mix. But we don't expect any appreciable changes in the can mix.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just had a question on the CapEx side. I think last quarter you talked about $175 million being directed to growth. So I just didn't know if you had any details at this point of where it might be spent, whether you would spend the entire amount? Just any color there would be great.
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. We just don't expect to spend around that $375 million number. I can tell you little bit more. We've got a couple of big projects. One is a new specialty addition to our portfolio, the new shape and size that will happen here in North America. And that will be spent -- really ramped up in the back half of this year to be producing next year. And then we're also adding -- due to the growth in Europe, we're going to add a specialty line in The Netherlands to keep up with the growing demand. And so that will get spent a decent amount again in the second half of this year to be able to be operating by the busy summer season next year. So those are -- we've got some other smaller things, but those are 2 larger ones that we can talk about now.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of just switching back to China quickly in terms of cost out. Is there much more room for improvement with those programs or is it kind of largely in the numbers at this point?
Scott C. Morrison: I think they continue to take -- they're making progress, and I think they'll continue to make progress through this year and even into the next year. We've got some longer-term plans about the way the business is operated. But I think we'll make it leaner and more cost-effective going forward. So they've done a lot of work already, and they'll continue to work through this year and into next year, frankly. I think our -- we're not hoping or waiting for the pricing environment to get better. As John mentioned, we're still making good EVA dollar returns there. And we're going to continue to focus on our cost side so that we're able to participate in the growth in that market and continue to be profitable and get good returns.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then if I -- in terms of that capacity that you're adding, can you share any details on sort of how much incremental capacity those lines in the U.S. and Europe would be?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, they're specialty lines, so it's a little bit different if you're talking about capacity. But not at this point, we're not going to share that.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question, just quickly on the aerospace business. I know you were talking about there's some contract potential later this year. But it looks like in a last 2 quarters, you've had some pretty darn good margins there. And is that a function of the type of work you're doing and could we see sort of this elevated level of margins continue?
John A. Hayes: No. I think it's a function of, as we get closer to the completion of some of these big programs, that's when you really get to recognize you've de-risked the project and you're getting your award fees. Obviously, you don't get award fees at the beginning of a contract. You get it when you're completing it. And I think over the last couple of quarters, that's why you've seen margins do what they do. And that's why you've seen our backlog come off a little bit as well.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And then changing gears a little bit, you all mentioned 2.5 years ago -- when we were out visiting -- some market data that suggested about 53% of U.S. beer cans were -- beer was -- was packaging cans. I think in Brazil it was like 39% and China was down around 10% or 15%. Could you update us on where you see those regions in terms of the beer share in cans?
John A. Hayes: Yes. You have a good memory. North America was about 53% and, I don't have the data in front of me, but it's in the mid- to upper-50s. It's actually moved up. I'd say, 55%, 56%, 57%, in that range. Down in Brazil, it was in the upper-30s, it's now in the lower-40s on the beer segment. And in China, really back a few years ago, it was really more like 4% or 5% -- excuse me, 5% or 6%. And that has moved up consistent with the other regions as well. So it's probably in the 7%, 8%, 9%.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. Okay. And when you look at -- just one more question on the soft drink side. There's, for whatever reason, sort of a presumption that I sense from you and your competitors that there's no real reason or hope to see a material change -- and maybe this is my perception -- in the share in the CSD segment in places where returnable bottles continue to be the lion's share, and plastic as well. Anything changing there, whether it be in China or in Brazil, in terms of the share in -- of CSDs in cans?
John A. Hayes: No. I don't believe that we see any material changes in the regions you mentioned relative to package share mix. As you know, cans don't play a big part in CSD in those regions you talked about. And so we don't see any big change.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A few questions there to clean up from our side. Can you comment at all about -- within North American beer, whether any of your larger customers are planning intensified new product introductions or promotional activities? Some of your customers in the last few years have had some difficulty in the marketplace. So to the extent that you can offer any color, that would be helpful.
John A. Hayes: I think as a general comment, George, every beer company out there, big or small, is looking at the proliferation of tastes and proliferation of new products. And it's not just limited to the big guys. And so I think you're seeing a lot of line extensions, a lot of new products, ciders new, for example, here in North America. And so I could go on and on. But as a general rule, I think you're seeing a fragmentation of taste. And therefore, a fragmentation and a differentiation of the products that our customers are making to respond to that.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Which in turn is one of the reason that you're seeing the proliferation in alternative can formats?
John A. Hayes: Bingo, you got it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. Within Brazil, back to the beer tax, I don't know if you have any color on this. But in the past, where there have been instances of these sorts of taxes, what has been the prior volume dropoff? And with the earnings season, I haven't had a chance to really study what the government announced yesterday, but would there be any differential or favoritism applied to beer in one pack form versus another or would it be across the board a comparable tax?
John A. Hayes: Yes. I believe it's our understanding, it's an across-the-board tax on both beer and soft drink. I think in many places, not just Brazil, when you see -- sometimes you see a short-term blip as the supply chain adjusts and price increases are ultimately passed through to the consumer. And so without going into great detail, we expect this to be no different. And so there might be a short-term blip. But again, this is not a wholesale change. Tax in Brazil is part of the everyday life. And so they did it as of June 1, which is kind of surprising, just a couple of weeks before the start of the World Cup. So who knows, maybe all the foreigners coming into Brazil will be paying for it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, maybe that's a way to sneak it in with a better demand environment so it's less noticeable to whichever consumer, domestic or tourist. Question on sweeteners, do you have any color from your marketing folks in terms of your customers' views on the new sweeteners for diet soft drinks and whether they should be particularly helpful or not really this year in terms of volume?
John A. Hayes: Yes, the only thing I can say, George, is what our customers have said publicly. And they said they have been experimenting and trying. And they would expect in 2014 to be rolling out some trials on various sweetener alternatives. And so that's really all we can say at this time.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I understand. My last one, then I'll turn it over. Scott, you were saying before that in China, while it's not necessarily as much fun as it used to be, and we understand. You're still making relatively good margin. You're making positive EVA dollars. Do you think your peers are making positive EVA dollars? And the question behind the question is, if they still are, then how do you ultimately call where we sit? And then to the capacity cycle, if the industry broadly are still earning above cost of capital even at these relatively depressed prices?
Scott C. Morrison: I don't think many people in the industry are earning above their cost of capital is my guess. I mean, we've seen some of those companies as they file public documents to go public that weren't achieving their cost of capital. So I think given our scale, our cost structure, we're able to still be able to do that, even in these tougher pricing environments. But I don't think a lot of people -- my guess is, that they're not earning their cost of capital.
John A. Hayes: Yes, and I think it's our -- George, it's our view that particularly with some of the smaller ones there, liquidity has been so free and available with respect to debt financing in China that, that has created this. At some point in time, credit always gets a little bit tighter and as a result of that, when it does occur, we believe that there will be some level of shakeout. But it's premature to say, but that's how we think about it.
Operator: And we also have a follow-up coming up from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just had one kind of quick one, more along the lines of capital allocation. You mentioned within the press release -- something that jumped out of me was, looking in extruded aluminum with new products -- I don't know if you said new capacity, but new customers, some new things. Could you maybe talk to us there about recycled? I know you've made virgin slugs here, but it sounds like you're doing some recycled elements with those. What's the outlook or thoughts with respect to also making some containers here, maybe in North America? Could you -- and maybe give us a little color from that front.
John A. Hayes: A couple of things that you raised there. Number one, I think, in terms of the new products, not only -- that category, we're always coming out with new shapes, new sizes with our customers, but we're also, to your point on the slug side, we, this year, we have actually commercialized, and it's in the market over in Europe with our ReAl slugs, which is a much higher recycled content, which provides more rigidity to the container at a lighter weight container. And so we think it's a pretty neat innovation that our folks came up with. And so that, as I said, now commercial in the European marketplace. And as we look to expand it and roll that out, we will continue to do so. We also, as you know, have a facility down in Mexico, and that's been going recently nicely. The volumes have been growing. We always wish it could grow a little bit faster, but it's going okay. But it's also provided a dialogue with our customers, an incremental dialogue with our customers about what else we can be doing. And I wouldn't be completely shocked if you, at some point in time, saw us making those containers somewhere in a facility in North America. But that's probably all I can say at this time.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful, actually. The second element with capital allocation. I know you guys historically have done a great job of balancing 3 different ways that you've gone back and redistributed more through capital, whether it's dividends, repurchase, whether it's investing in your own businesses, whether it's acquisition. As you kind of look today, the acquisition market, there's still a lot of activity. How would you -- in a way that you're able to address it, sort of talk about the environment as it sits today, more active, less active, seeing better things coming to market, worst things coming to market? Again, appreciating that it's sometimes a difficult topic to broach.
John A. Hayes: No, I appreciate that. As you know, we're always looking at opportunities. And to be honest, we're pretty disciplined when it comes to capital allocation. So you never know when it will pop. We've talked about this in the past where the deal wheel or the sponsor world, private equity world, with the rates and availability of capital being where they are, it's always incrementally more challenging for us to find the right return type projects, but we continue to look at those. And as I said before, you just don't know when they're going to pop. But our pipeline, not only now, but in the past, has been reasonably robust. It's just a function of, is it the right opportunity and the right time?
Operator: And there appears to be no further questions over the phone lines at this time. Mr. Hayes, I will now turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
John A. Hayes: Okay, thank you very much, Jasmine, and we appreciate all your support. And we look forward to speaking to you in several months. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 30, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Reynaldo, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2014. Our fourth quarter results came in ahead of expectations, and full year cash flow was right on track. As we mentioned in our third quarter conference call, we've seen momentum in our business from a financial perspective. And as we move into 2014, we are well positioned from a capacity utilization and product mix perspective, and we remain excited about our prospects. Excellent cost management across our global packaging businesses; volume growth in Europe, Brazil and our specialty can portfolio in North America; key aerospace program deliveries and our disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy all drove results. 2013 was truly a tale of 2 halves. The first half with stronger-than-anticipated market and economic headwinds and the second half filled with additional cost optimization project rollouts, line startups and a return to more normalized demand for our food and beverage containers all helped contribute to this improved performance. Now during the first -- fourth quarter, we continued to see double-digit growth for specialty cans in the Americas. We further improved our operating costs in our European segment, with the administrative office relocation on track for completion at the end of the first quarter 2014. We started up the second line in our Alagoinhas, Brazil, beverage can manufacturing plant, which contributed favorably to results and is ready to meet our customers' needs for specialty cans in the 2014 World Cup. We ramped up production at our existing Foshan, China plant after the relocation of our Shenzhen equipment. We continued down the path of further optimizing our steel food and household manufacturing footprint in North America. And lastly in the quarter, we announced the redemption of our 2019 senior notes that will lower interest expense in 2014, which Scott will discuss shortly. Our focused efforts to identify pockets of growth and manage our cost structure are bearing fruit and will drive EVA dollar and cash flow generation in 2014 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our full year and fourth quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $3.28 versus last year's $3.06. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus last year's $0.64, a 34% increase. For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: excellent cost management across the businesses; a full year contribution from line 1 at the Alagoinhas, Brazil plant and the Mexican extruded aluminum facility acquisition; a lower effective tax rate; and a lower share count. Also, FX translation related to European operations positively impacted full year 2013 EPS by $0.03. Turning to free cash flow, Ball generated $461 million in 2013. Again, we returned every free cash flow dollar and more to shareholders via net share buyback of approximately $400 million and dividends of more than $75 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3.2 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid, with a 2013 comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 4.8x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.7x. Cash was higher than usual at year end due to the planned redemption of the 2019 senior notes, which was completed on January 10, 2014. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of the full year and fourth quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Moving to operations, our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down roughly $11 million for the full year and up $9 million in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year benefit from the 12-ounce can and end plant rationalizations, cost containment programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued double-digit specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results. In the quarter, North America volumes continued to be sluggish for standard cans in the carbonated soft drink category. However, Brazil volumes were up double digits and our China volumes were flat, as we continue to run at very high utilization rates, and we continue to make disciplined decisions to not add capacity in an oversupplied market. European segment profit was flat for the full year and increased almost $10 million in the fourth quarter due to mid-single-digit volume growth and initial benefits of reduced labor costs, which will continue to flow through the segment in 2014 and into '15. Food and household comparable segment earnings were flat in the quarter due to mid-single-digit volume declines for steel food cans in North America. And for the full year, earnings improved roughly $10 million due to the contribution from last year's December's Mexico extruded aluminum plant acquisition and excellent operating performance at our remaining global manufacturing locations. As John mentioned earlier, our global manufacturing operations are starting to be rewarded for their incredible efforts to improve their cost structure and cash flow. Moving on to financial metrics for the full year 2014, interest expense will be in the range of $163 million. Full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%. And for modeling purposes, remember that the first quarter of 2013 benefited from 2 R&D tax credits. We expect full year corporate expense to be approximately $73 million. CapEx should be in the range of $375 million, and free cash flow will be in the range of $550 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Yesterday, the board increased the share repurchase authorization by 20 million shares, so we have plenty of room and expect to buy around $500 million net shares in 2014. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business performed very well in the quarter and full year against a difficult comp. Solid execution on existing programs and some early deliveries drove performance, quite an accomplishment given the disruptive U.S. government circumstances in the first and second half of 2013. Contracted backlog ended the year at $938 million versus $942 million a quarter earlier and approximately $1 billion at the end of 2012. During the quarter, the STPSat-3 satellite for the U.S. Air Force was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Center. The final 3 mirror segments for the James Webb Space Telescope arrived at Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Ball-built GMI instrument arrived in Japan for the upcoming launch onboard NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement satellite. The GPM satellite and GMI instruments are part of an international satellite constellation that will capture next-generation observations of rain and snow worldwide every 3 hours, as well as 3D views of hurricanes and snowstorms, aiding weather prediction. With the recent 2-year budget agreement, we are starting to see things in Washington have a bit more visibility than we have had in the past several years. Our aerospace team is awaiting decisions later in 2014 on several key program awards so that they can move forward with what they do best, providing affordable solutions for scientific discovery and national security. Now looking out across our company today, we will generate positive returns in 2014 on the growth capital invested in 2013. In Europe beverage, operating margins are improving as volume has recovered, and our ongoing cost optimization programs will provide further upside. In our global food and household products packaging business, we are laser-focused on maximizing returns across our steel product lines and positioning our extruded aluminum manufacturing capabilities to serve our global customers' filling locations. And most of all, we are proud of our employees and their resolve to execute on projects and programs to improve our company's performance. Truly exceptional. Given our operational momentum, excellent working capital management and reduced capital expenditures, as Scott mentioned, we expect 2014 free cash flow generation to be in the range of $550 million. In summary, we believe, at this time, we are on track to grow our EVA dollars and achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond. And with that, Reynaldo, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: John, can you talk about what's driving the strength in European beverage volume? I know you said it was mid-single digits. It was up, I think, 7% last quarter. I know you're levered to beer in that segment, and SABMiller recently talked about sluggish trends. So just trying to understand what's happening in your business that might be different from what some of your customers might be experiencing.
John A. Hayes: Well, I think a couple of things. I do think the can is improving its share of the overall package mix, not only with beer but even on the soft drinks side. So that's one big factor. I think the other one is geography. And as you all know, we're a bit more weighted to Western Europe, obviously, some presence in Eastern Europe, but where we don't have presence, really, in much of Southern Europe. And when you look as an industry where the growth has been coming from, it's really been coming from France, from Germany, from the U.K., from those places that I talked about in the third quarter. The first half of the year, recall, the weather was very terrible, and so volume was actually down in those regions. But in the second half of the year, it rebounded and it proved to be quite nice for us.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. In terms of EBIT this year, John, do you expect European beverage to be up more than Americas and Asia beverage? And can you quantify the potential benefit from the cost savings in Europe that you've discussed in '14 and going into '15?
John A. Hayes: Yes, well, we've talked in prior conference calls about our -- we expect to get back to the 2010, 2011 margin profile that we had in the European business. We actually had a very good second half of the year, but we still have opportunities, as Scott had mentioned, on the cost-out programs. So as we go into 2014, I think with normalized volumes, and that, obviously, we're sitting here in January so that's always a question mark, but with normalized volume, we continue to see progression in the EBIT growth of that business, largely through the cost-out programs and just maintaining our share of the European beverage can market.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And just one last one, just on the LME aluminum premium situation in Europe. Can you just discuss your exposure to that issue?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, the way we contract our business here, we don't really have any exposure in North America. And in Europe, I think I mentioned on the third quarter call, it had been a headwind for a while in Europe through '13. And if it stays elevated at these levels, we probably have some exposure to the tune of maybe EUR 5 million, but more on the back half of the year if it stayed at these levels for all year.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, first question I had is regarding China now. Obviously, your operating rates are quite high because of what you've been doing with capacity relative to demand. Is it possible from where you sit right now to discuss when you think the industry will be in a better state of balance, say, above 90%?
John A. Hayes: I think, George, let's start with the demand side and then we'll go to the supply side. On the demand side, overall industry volume growth continues to grow strongly, mid-single digits. We did not participate this year because we're pretty tight. And remember, we had -- in the second half of the year, we were moving some of our capacity from Shenzhen to Foshan, and so we were a bit short relative to that. And so we'll be able to capture our fair share of the growth this year. On the supply side, that's really the question mark. And I think over the -- there continues to be some of the smaller players adding capacity in. I think from a cost perspective, we feel like we're in pretty good shape, and so -- to ride out this wave. But if -- to give you an exact time or date on when the industry may get to 90%, I honestly think it's premature, and I would be speculating on it. I think we continue to expect the market to be growing mid-double digits. I'm sorry. I might have said mid-single digits in China growth, I meant mid-double digits. And so the volume side, demand side is growing quite strong. It's just when do people take a pause in terms of the capital growth so the supply can catch up with demand -- or demand can catch up with supply, I mean.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. But that in itself is saying something because the market is still growing mid-double digits and you're not sure when you get back to 90%, not blaming you guys here, nonetheless it tells you that there's still a fairly large amount of excess capacity to be absorbed. You would agree with that, correct?
John A. Hayes: I would agree. This time last year, George, we thought that there's arguably 25% overcapacity. And as -- despite the mid-teens growth in 2013, I don't think that changed materially, which, by definition, means some of the people kept adding capacity.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Same question. In Europe, where would you say operating rates are for you or for the industry, to the extent that you can comment? And then I had a follow-on on North America, and I'll turn it over after that question.
John A. Hayes: I think for us, we are sold out. We are full. And I think for the industry, it's pretty full as well. Obviously, on a regional side, you have pockets here and there. And, of course, even we may have very small pockets, depending on what the regional geographies are. But overall, I think the industry is reasonably tight, and we certainly are tight.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The last question, John, in North America. Is there a volume decline in standard cans in the next couple of years that would either, on one hand, create diseconomies for you in terms of managing the remaining 12-ounce demand in the market from your existing network of plants, or one of the things you've been obviously doing is converting your 12-ounce to custom cans and that seems to be working well, that to absorb whatever level of decline might happen in 12-ounce would then risk saturating the custom can market from capacity standpoint? I know there isn't perhaps a single number, but how would you have us think about what the rates of decline might need to be to get to that point?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think the answer to your question largely hinges on what happens with soft drink. CSD has really been the softness in terms of not only the can business, but I think the overall liquid consumption business. And we have -- we expect to have continued declines on the CSD side. I think 2014 is going to be real important to help answer that question because you're going to see natural sweeteners start to come out. And the question is, can the soft drink industry really strive to arrest these declines they've been having. To answer your question specifically, I think it's much more complicated than just having the numbers saying at what decline rate do you -- the oversaturation. I think we've been pretty disciplined over the last few years, and we've been doing it in our own economic best interest. Just looking at the past 12 years, we closed Columbus, we closed the Gainesville end plant, then we closed Milwaukee. That was in part. But at the same time, we also took some existing 12-ounce and converted. So I think that model, you can't do that forever, obviously, and we're very cognizant of that. But we're also cognizant of maintaining a tight supply/demand, at least in our system.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In European bev cans, just wondering if you could parse out demand trends in Western Europe versus Eastern Europe during the quarter?
John A. Hayes: We typically don't go into that level of granularity. But what I will tell you is Western Europe, the growth in Western Europe, the overall industry was up low- to mid-single digits, and there's a little bit more on Western Europe and a little bit less in Eastern Europe.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And I'm just curious as to any progress on the BPA-free coatings for the food can market. Can you just kind of update us as to what your customers are thinking there?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think it's been relatively quiet on that. From a technical perspective, we have solutions is the most important thing to say. There is a cost implication to that, and I don't believe our customers have felt the need to convert and look at the relative costs of that without any real either legislative reason or economic business reason. And so right now, it's more in a holding pattern.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And just one last one. Was there any benefit from the World Cup in 4Q for you guys? And if so, could you quantify the impact?
John A. Hayes: Well, other than America being qualified, I don't think we have any benefit. But I do expect that, certainly, in the second quarter, that's when we would expect to -- late second quarter and third quarter, expect to see the benefit.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Your EBIT margin for Americas and Asia was up pretty dramatically. Can you parse out how much of that was Brazil, China, or just better mix in North America? And going forward, is that sustainable? I do understand there's some seasonality in the business.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, Phil, this is Scott. We're coming off relatively easier comps from last year's fourth quarter, yet metal down year-over-year, which will help margin percentage. You had volume growth in Brazil, and you had volume in China and great cost controls in North America and China, and specialty growth in North America. All those things kind of played into why the margins were where they're at. And that's about as specific as I'm going to get.
John A. Hayes: And the only other thing that -- in North America, we had a decline of 12-ounce, which is a low-margin product.
Scott C. Morrison: True.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us some color on North America food on pricing for this year? I understand one of your customers is in bankruptcy. That could actually get sold off to a self-manufacturer. There's some noise in the marketplace with new capacity coming on in 2015.
Scott C. Morrison: Well, let me address the customer bankruptcy issue, because we took a charge in the third quarter for a portion of the receivable that we had owing from that customer. There's going to be an auction for that company that will occur next week, and we'll see the outcome of that, what the outcome of that auction is, if we have to make any changes to what we've already taken from a reserve standpoint. And if we have to change anything, we'll either do that in the 10-K or sooner. And in terms of the pricing environment overall, I'd say it's relatively stable.
John A. Hayes: Yes. There really -- there's no appreciable change in pricing in our customer base. And largely, we often look at the metal side of the business, and there's really no significant change we're talking about on the metal side. So I don't -- we don't see any big changes one way or the other right now.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on Europe bev, from what I understand, some of your competitors saw a modest lift, at least, on pricing last year, and the market appears to be still pretty tight. Is that going to be a positive tailwind in '14 or is it going to be pretty flat as well?
John A. Hayes: I think reasonably flat. The reality is Europe is -- the economic declines experienced over the past few years in Europe are -- have flattened out. But the economy is not strong. I do think that this whole supply chain of virtually every industry has continued to be under cost pressure and trying to take costs out of the system. And so I would not expect any appreciable change relative to the pricing environment.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation. If I look at your early-on comments of $461 million of cash flow from 2013, almost all of it returned to shareholders. And it looks like, if I heard the commentary correctly, that the plan for 2014 is very similar. And so I'm wondering, is that a comment indirectly on the outlook for the M&A environment and the ability for you to grow via acquisition?
John A. Hayes: Not necessarily. What I would say is we're always spending a fair amount of time on acquisition. And you often aren't given credit for the things either you pass on, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of activity going on. As you know, we are a very disciplined company when it comes to capital allocation. And when interest rates are very low, we buy things for the long term. And when interest rates are low, you have to compete with private equity and other firms like that. And so we haven't found anything, at least in the recent past, that has met our return requirements. And absent finding good return projects, we're going to return our value back to our shareholders either through share repurchase and/or dividends, and that is one reason why our board authorized a 20 million share repurchase authorization yesterday. Scott, anything to add?
Scott C. Morrison: No, I think that's right. The cash machine has kind of grown to a point where we can do a lot of things at the same time. So we're able to still invest. We still have some growth capital in the 2014 budget. And John talked about some of the growth capital that we spent in '13, that we'll start getting the returns on in '14. And we're still able to buy back a lot of stock. And so we'll still be able to do both of those things. And hopefully, acquisitions will come along that have good value, where we could get the kind of returns we want. But we don't need to be stretching for anything. And so we'll continue to be disciplined.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And the competitive environment within the acquisition market, specifically versus private equity, I guess I've heard some commentary that in this environment, they're not able to lever up as much as they used to on some acquisitions. Are you -- and, therefore, strategics are not as disadvantaged when it comes to acquisitions. Is that something you've been running into as well?
John A. Hayes: I guess, on the margin, but it's -- in this environment, capital is still quite available, and interest rates remain quite low. And so I think it's just you have a much broader set of competition. But I don't think there's any -- been significant change over the last, call it, 6 months or so, no.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just last question on the CapEx, $375 million. I mean, it looks like maybe you underspent a little bit versus plan in 2013. Is that just a rollover or is there something in that $375 million -- it was about $50 million more than what we forecast, not you, but our forecast. Is there something in there that we're not aware of?
Scott C. Morrison: There are some things in there that you're probably not aware of, but we're not ready to talk about them in total yet. I mean, part of it is carrying capital from last year, because we underspent what we thought we would spend. So a little bit shifted to the right. But there's still some growth projects that we're going after that we're just not ready to talk about at this point.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And those are growth projects meant to fill the gap in 2015. Is that how we should kind of think about that?
Scott C. Morrison: No, they're growth projects that have good long-term returns to them. It has nothing to do with what year they're in. It's just the opportunity that's coming. It's getting to maturity. And we think we have good contracts to support the capital that we would spend.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I noticed, and I don't know if you addressed this, John, the aerospace margins were sort of the highest I'd ever seen, or at least in a very long time. Was that sort of a onetime wonder getting the 20 -- the 12 percentage-type margins that I think you made close to $25 million last quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes, don't think that's sustainable. I do think we had some early deliveries and some other things, including some execution on existing programs, that made it really more of a onetime bump in the margin. I think as we look out into '14, margins for the full year '14 should be comparable to the full year '13.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And then I don't know if, Scott, you've specifically mentioned it, but what is the change in the cash pension contribution rate in '14 versus '13? So, I guess, what were those numbers? And how does that compare to the book expense for both years?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, the expense from '13 to '14 will be down $15 million to $20 million because of interest rates and a variety of things. The cash funding will be down considerably because we did fund up -- in the fourth quarter, we did fund up our pension more. And so it will be down considerably.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Like 50 or...
Scott C. Morrison: More than 50.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Got you. And then last question. I don't think this was asked, but -- or maybe I missed it, but you mentioned the specialty can volumes were sluggish in 12-ounce in North America. I don't know if you gave a more specific number and/or if you could tell us what specialty can volumes did in North America in the fourth quarter year-over-year.
John A. Hayes: Yes, the 12-ounce was sluggish, and I think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but they were certainly down as an industry mid-single digits, if not a little touch more than that. Specialty volumes, for us, we've said for the full year -- I think the fourth quarter and the full year were about the same, which was kind of mid-teens.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Up mid-teens. Got you.
John A. Hayes: Yes.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you here. First, when we look -- one of the businesses that you didn't particularly highlight in here was the extruded aluminum. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing there with respect to opportunities? I know that in the past, it's been an area you've targeted for some growth and, in particular, potentially some more lines. Can you maybe give us an update as to how that business is progressing?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Chris, that's a good question. It's -- we have, over the past few years, really put some focus on that in terms of growing that business, both organically and inorganically, via acquisition. I think our European business continues to grow well. Volume has slowed down a little bit in Europe over the past few years because of the economy. We were up slightly. And I think the folks over there are doing a great job. As you all know, in December, 13 months ago, we acquired the Mexican plant, and that facility has -- the volumes are still growing double digits, kind of mid -- low- to mid-teens. We wish they were growing a little bit higher, to be quite frank, but I think that's going well. And from an acquisition, as well as a greenfield perspective, we still have opportunities to expand our footprint. And we've been looking at serving our customers, whether it's here in North America or whether it's in Europe or other parts of the world. We continue to be focused on that. I think there's going to be some opportunities as we move forward into '14 and even beyond.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And that's kind of a good segue to -- when I think about the $175 million this year of growth capital that you've got chartered in there, and I also appreciate you don't want to get too granular at this juncture on what you're doing, I anticipate you'll probably give us more color as the year progresses. But when I think about the -- I said growth capital, I meant return-oriented capital. Give us maybe a sense of what the balance is between growth-oriented projects and what might be more cost takeout or other efficiency projects as we think about those.
John A. Hayes: Yes, of the -- so let's break this down. Of the $375 million of capital that Scott mentioned, our maintenance capital, if you will, is in the range $175 million to $200 million. And within that maintenance, there's always a level of cost-out in that, whether it's getting more efficient on the energy side or other things like that. But the additional, call it, $175 million of what we call is growth capital, not too much of that is in terms of just pure cost-out. It really is growth. I just mentioned impact extruded. There are some opportunities in there of broadening our geographic reach on the impact extruded side from a greenfield perspective. On the beverage can side, there's opportunities in there. I don't think on the aerospace side, over a couple of years ago, we significantly expanded our ability to manufacture satellites in our Boulder facility, so there's not a lot in there. So it really is beverage cans and impact extruded. And I focused it in broadening our geographic reach and in terms of new products and new capabilities.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. Last quick one I had was, in the past, we've talked about -- you've given some color about what's happening in China with respect to the growth and that you anticipate being able to capitalize a little better on it this year. Could you give us some color as to what the pricing environment has been like in relation to the capacity that's still there? Has it stabilized, been more constructive, continued to be more challenging? How would you maybe give us some thoughts there?
John A. Hayes: There hasn't -- I think I said on the third quarter, that China remains difficult. I don't -- it's not going down appreciably, but there have been pockets of softening -- continued softness on the pricing side and -- which is challenging. And it gets to the question I think George asked earlier about supply/demand dynamics. Until supply dynamics become more in favor, I just -- we're not anticipating upside in pricing.
Scott C. Morrison: So we're focused a lot on the cost side. Our guys are doing a great job on the cost side, which is helping the business, but prices aren't getting any better right now.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You referenced can demand improving in Europe, or rather can's share of the overall package market in Europe improving in both beer and CSD. And I'm wondering if it's possible to quantify that. Is it something that's happening more at the margin? And then what is driving that from your perspective? Is it economic pressures, consumer preference? Is it something your customers are driving?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think the answer is yes to all of that. Just a little context. I think for the full year, the market grew 3%, 3.5% over in Europe. And again, Europe is a big place with many different geographies, so I'll generalize here. But Europe grew kind of low- to mid-single digits. I know that liquid consumption did not grow that much. And so by definition, the can took a little bit of share. Reasons why cans took a little bit of share, I think there are changing consumer preferences for one-way packaging over returnable bottles, and we've talked about that in the past. I do think that in some of the more mature economies, people are staying home a bit more and the can is more of a home package. So I think that has been helping. I think those are the 2 things that are probably driving this can share mix the most. It's not seismic. It's over time and gradual. And recall that relative to at least the United States, for example, the can as a share of the package mix is much smaller in Europe, writ large, than it is in the U.S. The U.S. on the beer side, it's over 50% of beer is consumed out of cans in North America. In Europe, writ large, it's in the low- to mid-20s.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sure. Sure. And just as a follow-up. I mean, you're coming up on a very easy comp for Europe in the first quarter. I think January demand last year was reasonably strong, and then things really kind of melted down in March. I think there was some weather issues, and you had some other cost issues as well. But I'm just wondering, did the experience of first quarter 2013, in any way, change the way that you kind of forecast the full year? Did it make you more cautious? Or was that really just sort of a freak event from your perspective?
John A. Hayes: Well, I don't know if weather is a freak event. But demand, as we said this in the past, we had 2 quarters, the first and second last year, that were down year-over-year, and that hasn't happened too often in the decade we've been operating in Europe. In fact, it 2 out of 3 times happened last year, and it was both in the first half. I do think it was soft demand. Recall also, we talked about in mid to late 2012, we actually had moved our European headquarters from Germany into Switzerland, and we knew we had some redundant costs. And we were -- 2013 was an act to try and get after those costs. I think the lessons learned from the first half of last year was you can't rely on volume all the time, so you ought to be proactive and aggressive at all times about the cost side of the business. And I think our folks have responded very well. And that's why as we go into 2014, our cost programs are really executing well, while at the same time, if the volume is normalized, it provides a little bit of upside. And that's why I said earlier on, it is only January. If we could get through the first half of the year and volumes are normalized, we feel pretty good, but it's just too early to predict what the weather is going to do.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I realize you guys don't have a crystal ball for Brazil, but what is [indiscernible] Ball assuming for the next year, if you could give some sort of range? And I believe the expectation is for one-way containers to outpace returnable glass next year. But looking out beyond that, do you think that a shift in the pack mix towards cans is still sustainable?
John A. Hayes: It's a good question, Debbie. And I think we're -- we expect 2014, because of the "2 summer effect" we've talked about, it to be positive. And with the World Cup being there, the can is a great one-way package. The can as a share of the package mix is approaching, at least on beer side, 40%. And I've mentioned a couple of minutes ago, in the U.S., it's over 50%. So there's probably some marginal improvement on that, but not wholesale improvement. And so as we go past 2014, we expect overall volumes to more closely reflect the overall beer growth. But in 2014, we do expect some nice growth.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then has your customer mix shifted materially over the last 6 months in Brazil at all with your new capacity?
John A. Hayes: No.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just a final question. What is your outlook for can demand in North America? And are you happy with your standard and specialty can footprint?
John A. Hayes: Well, on the standard 12-ounce containers, we expect continued declines on the soft drinks side. We expect flat to slight declines on the beer side. And we expect to continue the growth that we've seen on the specialty side. From a footprint perspective, as we sit here now, we feel good about our footprint. And we wish that 12-ounce was a bit stronger, but that's as much reliant upon consumer demand. And as we have shown over the years, we will do what's necessary and in our economic best interest to make sure we're maximizing the value of what we do.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Just wanted to dig in Europe bev on the -- on your market share. Has there been any change throughout the year in '13? And so far, what's the outlook for '14 in that regard?
John A. Hayes: No is the short answer. We just give you -- for the full year in 2013, as I said, the market was up 3%, 4%. We were up slightly less in that. A lot of it had to do with just timing and geography. As I mentioned, the first year was -- the first half was softer, the second half was a bit stronger. But there has been no appreciable change in that. In any given year, different things are happening with different customers, but no, there hasn't been any meaningful change.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify on China as well. With the cost savings and optimization you're doing there, how are you -- but yet pricing still under some pressure. How are you thinking about overall profits in China in '14 versus '13?
Scott C. Morrison: I think that will get a little bit better. I mean, it's not going to be wholesale. But we took a big price hit last year, and I think we'll do a little bit better in '14, both from a volume standpoint and a cost-out standpoint.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. Got it. And from a pricing perspective in the market, how would you characterize '14 versus '13? Is the magnitudes of the declines lessening there or similar? I know we're not fully wrapped up there yet, but in terms of contract renewals, how -- so far how's the tenor there?
Scott C. Morrison: I mean, we're not seeing anywhere near the price declines that we saw from '12 to '13 going into '14, but the environment is still soft. It's still weak, and there's isolated things going on in different places. But there's still -- as John talked about, there's still way too much capacity. And so we're doing what's in our control in terms of cost-out. And we're growing with -- a little bit with the market. And all those things should help us, but the pricing environment is not getting better yet.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then on the food can side, we heard from of one of your peers yesterday, and they had talked about extending some contract lengths. And I was wondering if you could sort of update us on how you're doing on the food can side and any changes to your contract length structures, et cetera.
John A. Hayes: The short answer is nothing out of the ordinary. We have a variety of different customers and a variety of different customer contracts, and nothing really has changed appreciably in that. We have -- our focus on is -- everyone knows at the end of '14, we expect to lose some business from a customer, and we've talked about that for the last 6 months. I think 2014, we have plans in place, and the timing of the execution will occur throughout 2014 as we move towards that date. We have a hole to fill, we recognize that, but I'll bet our people against anyone else any time.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. I appreciate it. Final question is just a clarification on pension, tailwind of $15 million to $20 million. Can you help us just with where that flows through in the segments? I imagine most of that is going to be in the U.S. And could we assume, say, 75% of that in U.S. bev and maybe 25% or so in food can? Or help us kind of parse out where that will flow through.
Scott C. Morrison: It does hit the U.S., but remember, we got a big aerospace business, too. So you look at where the percentage of employees are. Food has a bigger impact than what you'd think the size of the business, but it's an older business. Let me get to the detail, I don't want to tell you off the top of my head, but I do have that detail. But it kind of runs across the businesses.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of things. One, so if we look to '14 and could see your expectations for European profitability, would we see more of the profit growth that you expect coming from a pickup in volume or would it come more from the cost-out? If you had mentioned that earlier, I apologize, I had missed it.
John A. Hayes: Yes, well, as you know, George, it's difficult to parse it out because it's a fixed-cost business. So when you get a little bit more volume, is that because of volume or because of cost? I will tell you this, all things being equal, our guys are doing -- our folks are doing a very good job on the cost side of the business. And so we're going to continue to put our shoulder into that throughout '14. And as I mentioned, we're closing our German regional headquarters, and that should happen late first quarter. And we have a bunch of other cost-out opportunities that we have been executing on, and so that's a big focus on that.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Related question and segueing a little bit on, I guess, Al's last question. Again, one of your peers yesterday was talking about some of the other things that they're working on to, one, make the food can more viable; and from our vantage point, two, secure their position with their customers and in their market, along with plant realignment and looking at new markets. Are you doing any kind of co-investing with your customers on a longer-term basis, more so now than perhaps had been the case? Can you share any more details on the plan that you're executing in '14?
John A. Hayes: No appreciable difference in terms of what you described as co-investing with our customers relative to what we've done in the past.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And the last question, and I'll turn it over, there's been some discussion in the trade that maybe not right now, but over time, there's going to be more and more usage of aluminum sheet in auto manufacturing. And if that, in fact, does occur, how do you think that might affect the availability of can sheet in the market? Obviously, something that's very important to you. What if your suppliers told you about that and the likelihood of supply shortages, again, not now but maybe down the road?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I'm not sure I'd worry about supply shortages. I think that beverage can has been pretty steady, so it's a nice steady business. But the automotive business, historically, has a little bit more volatility toward it. And I think there's a question of how much auto converts to aluminum and is that a stepping stone to another type of material, some kind of composite material. So I think all this is going to take some time to play out. So we'll see.
John A. Hayes: The only other thing, George, I'd add to that is it really is -- what you're talking about is more of a North American phenomena than anything else. And because of the pass-through nature of the business, it's not a huge impact.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And, I guess, for that matter, too, to the extent you'd rather the other -- the reverse be true, to the extent that can demand isn't growing by leaps and bounds, that makes more availability, I guess, of can sheet as well. But it sounds like your suppliers aren't telling you to worry about this anytime soon.
John A. Hayes: Well, I think to be honest, they're excited about the automotive opportunity. And -- but Scott raised an excellent point. They're doing it because of EPA guidelines in terms of miles per gallon for cars. It is a lighter-weight material than steel, but it is much more difficult to handle relative to steel in terms of welding and other things like that. The question is, is it a conversion to aluminum or is aluminum a migration to another form of composites or other things like that.
Operator: We have one final follow-up question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: John, Scott, how do you factor the recent fluctuations in emerging markets into your CapEx plans? And I know you're strategy is to follow your customers, but are you any less inclined to expand in emerging markets than perhaps you were a year or 2 ago?
Scott C. Morrison: Not really. I mean, it all dependent on the right opportunity. These things kind of come and go. I don't get too caught up in where currencies trade in a particular day. When we put assets in the ground, we're going to be there for a long time. And so if the long-term economic value proposition is there, we would still do it.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. In Brazil, how would you characterize the capacity situation at the moment? And based on our industry growth expectations, do you think more capacity will be necessary over the next couple of years?
John A. Hayes: It will be interesting to see. I think it's reasonably tight for '14 because of the World Cup. I think after that, the biggest question is, given the economic situation, given the political situation and given the growth of the middle-class in Brazil, what happens after '14 in terms of liquid consumption, in terms of can growth, in terms of the overall economic profile. And so we're looking at that very closely, but first and foremost, we're saying, "Let's put our head down and get through '14, and then we'll evaluate it a little bit more."
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just one last one. Scott, forgive me if you mentioned this earlier, but interest expense, how much of a benefit do you expect it to be this year?
Scott C. Morrison: I said that we expect full year interest expense in '14 to be around $163 million. So the bonds that we issued last year and the redemption of the notes in January, it's kind of -- the mix of that will help interest by quite a bit.
Operator: And we have no more questions at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Thank you very much for participating. And we look forward to what we think could be a strong 2014. And we'll speak to you in April. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded Thursday, October 24, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2013 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. It was great seeing many of you in New York earlier this month at our investor field trip. We hope that you walked away with a better sense of who we are and more importantly, where we're going. A special thanks to Ann Scott for organizing a great event. Now joining me on the call this morning is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish it up with comments out of our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013. Our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations, excluding the impact of a provision for customer receivable, which Scott will speak to in a moment. Solid operating performance across our various business units, a strong year-over-year vegetable pack in North America and a normalization of volumes in our global beverage business, where volumes were up across all regions, save for the previously announced loss of some 12-ounce business in North America, all contributed to stronger performance as we expected. As we have discussed previously, we knew that we had headwinds entering 2013. And while those headwinds in the first half of the year were quite frankly stronger than anticipated, the hard work and effort by all here at Ball have positioned us for a more constructive second half of 2013 and has created some tailwind for us as we enter 2014. As we cycle into the fourth quarter and more importantly into '14, the company is well positioned from a capacity utilization, product mix and earnings and cash generation perspective. During the quarter, we continue to aggressively manage manufacturing output for 12-ounce capacity in North America with the rationalization of our 12-ounce capacity in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also improved our fixed cost leverage in our European segment, as we progress through the initial cost-out initiatives related to the headcount reductions and the announced closure of our Ratingen, Germany administrative office relocation. In Brazil, we've completed the installation of a second line in our Alagoinhas beverage can manufacturing plant, which sets us up nicely for a double summer, as we prepare to meet our customers' needs in the summer down here in Brazil in 2014, as well as the 2014 World Cup. In Asia, we optimized our footprint and improved our cost structure there with the relocation of our Shenzhen beverage can plant into our existing Foshan plant. We also completed the installation of another production line in our Mexican impact-extruded facility, and we expect continued growth in this region during 2014. Lastly, in the quarter, we've completed the conversion of the standard can line to specialty can production in North America. We are seeing the benefits of our renewed efforts to manage our cost structure and drive further EVA dollar growth. In fact, since 2010, we've improved our EVA dollars generated, as defined in our 10-K, from $110 million to more than approximately $160 million today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter were $1 versus last year's $0.90. In addition, the company recorded an after-tax charge totaling approximately $32 million, primarily related to a provision for our customer receivable. Due to the confidential nature of the customer situation, we are unable to talk about it in great detail here, but will provide more details in the 10-Q. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down roughly $7 million year-over-year. Cost containment program, excellent operating performance at the plant level and double-digit specialty can growth in the Americas nearly offset segment volumes being down mid-single digits in the quarter due to a loss of the 12-ounce business in North America that has been well documented. Brazil volumes were up strongly, again, year-over-year and our China volumes were up mid-single digits. Across the segment, we are running at high-asset utilization rates and the recently installed second line at our Alagoinhas, Brazil facility is online and ramping up to meet our customer's new brewery located just down the road. European segment profit increased in the quarter in the mid-upper-single digit volume growth brought about by better weather conditions, coupled with reduced labor and input cost, both of which continue to be addressed aggressively. In the food and household segment, earnings were higher due to better volumes, our recently acquired Mexico plant and good performance in our steel and aluminum aerosol business. Segment volume increased nearly 10% in the quarter as a result of the favorable North American seasonal fruit and vegetable pack and solid aerosol container demand. Transitioning from operations, during the quarter, our corporate undistributed cost and the effective tax rate were in line with expectations and year-to-date. We have repurchased of net $268 million of our stock. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.35 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 4.7x, and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.9x. Committed credit and available liquidity at the end of the quarter was an excess of $1 billion. Given our seasonality and strong free cash flow, we continue to anticipate year-end net debt level to be in the range of $3.2 billion. For a complete summary of the third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Moving on to financial metrics for the full year 2013, really, no changes here. Interest expense will be in the range of $183 million, the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27%. We're still anticipating full year corporate expense to be approximately $73 million. CapEx will come in, in the range of $400 million and free cash flow should be in the range of $450 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well in the quarter with solid execution on existing programs. During this quarter, the Ball-built WISE spacecraft was roused from a 2-year hibernation to resume its near-Earth asteroid hunting mission. We also delivered the STPSat-3 satellite for the U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space-3 mission, and contracted backlog at the quarter end was $942 million, down just slightly from the previous quarter. Despite lingering effects of sequestration and the recent U.S. government shutdown, we continue to see operationally -- opportunities, excuse me, both domestically and internationally to help grow our aerospace business. Now looking out across our company today. Our businesses are leveraging new processes and systems, our world-class employee base and their EVA mindset to drive cost-out initiatives and execution on key programs and projects. We have invested prudently in our businesses for incremental EVA dollar growth, whether it has been specialty growth in North America, geographic growth in Latin and South America or cost-out initiatives in Europe and Asia, which we expect to generate positive returns in 2014 and beyond. In Europe beverage, we are on track to get back to our operating margins consistent with the 2010, 2011 period by 2015. And in our global food and household products packaging business, we are ramping up aluminum aerosol production and focusing on maximizing the returns across our steel product lines. In summary, we expect continued strong free cash flow and full year 2013 comparable results to exceed full year 2012 comparable diluted earnings per share. Given our operational momentum and reduced future CapEx target, we expect 2014 to be more consistent with our historical earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15%, and higher free cash flow generation. And with that, James, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Philip Gresh from JP Morgan Asset Management.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question for you, it sounds like the volumes are pretty good in Europe. I was bouncing between calls, but I think you said up mid- to high-single digits. I would just to get a little bit more color, just kind of regionally or by country or whatever additional color you could give about your volume performance.
John A. Hayes: Certainly. As you know, I think on our second quarter call we said -- we started to see at the beginning of July some more normalized weather patterns, and the good weather led to an increase in fillings in Europe. For us, I think it was largely driven by the Benelux region, by France, by U.K. even Poland, and to a lesser extent, Germany. And so those, as you all know, is the sweet spot of where we operate. So I think we were just the beneficiaries of much more normalized weather. And as we said, across Europe, for us, it was mid- to upper-single digit, kind of 7 percent-ish range.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. Second question on Europe, there has been so much out around this aluminum premiums issue. I'm just wondering if you think about like the past few years and the run-ups in those premiums, do you have any sense that you could give us about -- or quantification you could give us as to just how much of a headwind that's been for you over time?
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. Phil, this is Scott. Last year, it cost us probably around EUR 4 million. It started to ramp up in the back half of the year last year. This year, kind of a full year, it's probably going to be closer to EUR 8 million or EUR 9 million. They've just started to moderate recently. But with inventories, you know we have to flush inventories through the system, we really didn't get any benefit of that yet. But that's kind of the magnitude of the cost that's hit us in the past year -- 1.5 years.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just last question, curious how you're feeling about China today. Where are we kind of on the supply/demand curve heading into 2014? How are you thinking about pricing for next year? It seems like maybe flat to down at best, but I just want to get your thoughts here.
John A. Hayes: Yes. I think you're spot on. Not much has changed from our point of view about China. And what I mean by that is, number one, we are -- do continue to see strong growth in volumes. Number two, there still is a fair amount of excess capacity. I think either some of the players have slowed down some of their growth plans, but others have continued on. And so from a pricing perspective, it's not getting any better as we sit here today. I don't think it's getting materially worse, but it's certainly not getting better. And so until some of this capacity is better utilized with growth in the market, I think our expectation is that we're not going to have much upward mobility in pricing.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of George Staphos from Merrill Lynch.
Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's actually Alax Wang sitting in for George. First, can you discuss maybe what the pace of delayering in Europe and how that's going for you guys?
John A. Hayes: I'm sorry, you said the pace of what in Europe?
Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Delayering?
Scott C. Morrison: Delayering?
John A. Hayes: Delayering? Well, if you're talking about the pace of our cost, I think there's really -- we're just continuing to move down that continuum of taking cost out. We said on the second quarter it's going to take some time because you have to have the various discussions with work [ph] councils and unions. And we announced the closure of our Ratingen, Germany administration facility, but that won't close until the first quarter or so of 2014. And so while we've been taking some short-term measures to take cost out, and our guys have been doing -- our folks have been doing a great job of that, this is more of an 18-month type of play. And as we said, it's really the second half of 2014 and going into 2015 when we really will start to see the benefits of that.
Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. In terms of the timing wise, everything is to your expectations at present?
John A. Hayes: We are on track.
Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just second question. Can you discuss what you're seeing or maybe hearing from customers about marketing programs and trends in North America beverage, particularly in CSD?
John A. Hayes: Yes. We did see some -- particularly around the Labor Day weekend, we did see some greater than recent normal promotional activity by the soft drink customers, as well as some even some of the beer customers. There have been, I think, both on the beer and the CSD side, they continue to focus on the revenue line. But I also -- we also see that they are much more constructive about the volume relative to the price increases. And their price increases, I think, have been a little bit more moderate over the past few months as they go into 2014. I do know, in both of those segments, new products are very important. I think the biggest question on the soft drink side is not how cans are doing, but rather why are consumers drinking less CSD and what are they drinking instead? And I think the soft drink companies are very focused on that, whether it's natural, low-calorie sweeteners or new products that help respond to that new channel opportunities. So I think we are seeing a slightly more constructive end market. But having said that, it's still is -- the growth is anemic at best. And we need to -- if there's one thing that we are focused on, particularly on the soft drink side, I'm less concerned about beer, but we're very much focused on trying to make sure that we understand what's going on from the soft drink perspective.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. First, could you -- as we think about what the free cash flow might look like next year and parts of working capital -- I'm sorry, CapEx heading into next year, where are you at, early thinking with respect to those and any big projects or things that may spill over into next year?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, we had -- Chris, this is Scott. We had about $100 million of carrying capital this year, so I would expect -- we're spending in a pretty decent clip this year and so I would expect to have less carryover capital into 2014. So I think capital will come down. There's still some growth projects that we're evaluating that would be in that number. But I think, overall, CapEx should start to trend down and free cash flow will trend up. We have some more things on the working capital front that we think will benefit us next year. And so we feel pretty good about the growth in the free cash flow for 2014.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. So when you think about weak metal in a different way, when you think about utilization levels globally and you put in a bunch of capacity in China, you've got -- some still going in, in Brazil, as you have those now all fully contributing or I guess the plants down in Brazil is still ramping up and coming together. But where do you think you'll be at utilization? Do you have pockets where -- including, I guess, Vietnam, and there too you did some work there, where do you think you'll end up being for utilization? Are you running -- going to be running tight over the next year or 2, that those would be areas you might be looking at for capacity? How would we kind of think about where you'd be targeting?
John A. Hayes: Yes. I think, across the board in every region in which we participate, we're running pretty tight relative to capacity. Certainly, with the closure of Milwaukee, that was -- and you all know that we've been very assertive in managing our supply and demand there. That really depends on what the market or growth, or lack thereof, occurs in 2014. But we're tight, as we speak, in North America and Europe, we're very tight. And I do think that over the next 18 months, our #1 priority is the cost-out. But as we start to think about going into 2015, we have to think about capacity because we are getting very tight there. China, we really haven't added all that much capacity. We've moved the facility from Shenzhen up into Foshan, but that wasn't necessarily net-net any significant increase in capacity. So we're running very tight there. You mentioned Vietnam, I think all of Southeast Asia, I think there's probably some more opportunity, but we're going to be balanced around that. And then in Brazil, as you rightly pointed out, the second line in Alagoinhas is just getting started up. So I don't see any new capacity going into Brazil. I think some of the growth projects Scott were talking about, we haven't finalized them right now, but it's looking at geography and it's looking at new products. I think those are the 2 big areas when you think about where it could come from.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Last question was when I looked at some of the language in your press release, you talked about investing in the extruded aluminum, are you referring to what you're doing down in Latin America or are there thoughts for additional potential lines either in North America or Europe there?
John A. Hayes: No. I think our intent was -- that was talking about Latin America. Mexico, specifically.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Usha Guntupalli from Goldman Sachs.
Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A quick question. First, could you provide any early read on fourth quarter volumes across regions?
John A. Hayes: I think it's premature to talk about fourth quarter volumes. I will say the weather continues to moderate and we haven't seen any meaningful deviations from the trend lines we saw in the July, August, September. But as you know, the fourth quarter is seasonally slow. The only deviation I'll point out from that is probably in the food can business, where we thought a quarter ago that we would get some -- it would pushed -- some of the opportunity would be pushed into the fourth quarter, which it doesn't look like it will. You also -- we had a very strong fourth quarter in that segment in the third quarter. And so I think, while we thought some of that maybe pushed to the fourth, I think it stayed in the third. But absent that, the volume trends are -- particularly in the beverage side I was referring to, is nothing inconsistent with what we'd expect.
Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And looking at the next 12 to 18 months, could you remind us about the major cost savings that you expect to achieve across segments?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Very quickly, in Europe, we'll start there. We talked about getting back to a more normalized margin structure, which was -- if you look back in the 2010, 2011 time frame, it was 11% to 12%. And we said over the 18 months, we have a clear line of sight and we don't have to rely on net pricing to get there, although we are also focused on net pricing. I think in North America beverage, our folks has done a very good job in managing a difficult situation, not only with the losses in 12-ounce business, but also with the very tough macroeconomic environment relative to the beverage can demand here in North America. And so we continue to take cost out. And I think the Milwaukee, Wisconsin rationalization is a good example of that. I think our food and household products business here in North America, over the next 12 to 18 months, is very much focused on it. As we start to cycle into end of 2015, when we'll have a lost of some business there. But our guys are very -- our folks are very much on top of that. And as we sit here today, I think our folks are up for the challenge, no doubt. Down in Brazil, it's not so much about a cost-out, as it is managing and optimizing the supply/demand relative to what we expect to be a very strong year next year. Because, as I mentioned, the summer months are really October through March, and then they have the World Cup in June and July. And then in Asia, we have to be low-cost there. And I think we've proven over time that we are low cost and what we're trying to do is widen the gap relative to particularly the local competitors there, because of our global know-how and global expertise. So that's just a quick snapshot of the various levers that we're trying to pull from a cost perspective.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: My first question is on the food can segment. And I know this is really early days, but could you update us on any progress you've made to offset the volume being lost in 2015?
John A. Hayes: Well, the short answer is nothing material that we can add at this time. We had an Investor Day that was webcast a few weeks ago, if not close to a month ago, and we talked in a slightly more granular way about -- we have half a dozen or so various discrete items that we are focused on from a project perspective, and we expect to begin to execute on those in the fourth quarter. But really, more likely, the first half of 2014. This business remains with us throughout '14, so it's really '15. We've got 15 months or so to manage it. And I think our folks are very much in tune and focused on what needs to be done.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Perfect. And then switching gears. In the aerospace segment, have you seen any major impact from the government shutdown. Also, as sequestration hits the government aerospace contracts with potential for more, could you give us a sense of what you are replacing those contracts with?
John A. Hayes: Yes. First, in term -- we did see -- and we've seen this since sequestration kicked in, in March. We've seen a slowdown in decision-making at the government and with the complete shutdown for what, 16 days or so it was, everything just stopped. And so that's why I inferred our backlog was down slightly, but nothing fundamentally has changed. I think just decision-making is taking a little bit longer. I will say it's a bit frustrating that they just punted just a couple of months, and so we're talking about the January-February time frame having a very similar set of discussion. And that just puts timing of decision-making up in the air as well. So that gives me little bit of concern. But again, as I said, the fundamentals of what we do for the U.S. government has not changed at all, nor has the opportunity set. We have, however, as we've talked in the past, looked at other scenes [ph] of growth and revenues, whether it's internationally or with some more commercial or commercially oriented opportunities. And whether it's a Sentinel program, which is done in a non-for-profit world that's not affiliated with the U.S. government or the GEMS just contract we won in South Korea, I think those are good examples of the types of things we're looking at, and we continue to explore those opportunities. And we do believe that, over time, we're going to win our fair share of those.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Todd Wenning from MorningStar.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: As you look across your various businesses, which segment do you think has the most momentum in terms of EVA dollar generation going into 2014?
John A. Hayes: That's a good question. I think all -- to one degree or another, our European folks have really rallied around the cost-out. And given that, that is in our control, more than anything else, we don't have to rely on weather, we don't have to rely on external demand. We see a clear line of sight there. I think down in Brazil as well. As I mentioned, the 2 summers and -- actually, as we sit here right now, we're actually in Brazil, we've brought our board down here this week and we see a lot of very good momentum. And it's quite clear that a lot of the market share gains of cans relative to glass are not just temporary, they're permanent. And so we're feeling pretty good about Brazil. In North America, it really is a volume game there and so our folks have been doing a great job there. But it's just -- it's too premature to predict what 2014 volumes will look like. And I think the same with China relative to the volumes versus the price mix. So it's really about Europe and Brazil, I think, have the greatest line of sight into EVA dollar generation.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Great. And then as more specialty can capacity is being added by the industry in North America and Europe, have you seen the margins spread between standard and specialty contract in a meaningful way?
John A. Hayes: No, we haven't. Any maturation curve of any new product, you need to expect over time that it will rather gravitate more towards a mean. But I think what we're trying to do is stay out ahead and have the flexibility for our customers. So when we talk about specialty, we're not just talking about one different can size, we're talking about a wide variety. In North America and/or in Europe, we're making over 20 different sizes in each of those locations. And so it allows us the flexibility to flip between sizes on behalf of our customers, and I think they find there's value there -- in there for them as well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Stivaletti from Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Stivaletti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering, from a bigger picture perspective, if you could talk about your appetite for acquisitions, if that's something that you're spending much time on and what areas might be most likely?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think we're always spending a fair amount of time on acquisitions. Many times nothing happens, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of activity going on. As we've talked about in the past, it's -- given that we're a very disciplined EVA company, sometimes it's challenging to compete against private equity and other buyers when interest rates are still low and liquidity is still free. And I think we see that right now. As we go forward though, I think there has been great opportunities when we're disciplined and we're tenacious on one hand, but also patient on the other hand to take advantage of situations when they arise, when others are not as aggressive or cannot be aggressive from a financial or operational perspective. So we haven't announced anything, but don't assume we haven't been looking and haven't been actively pursuing opportunities. And as we sit now, liquidity is still relatively free. And so it makes it a bit more challenging for us to compete. But over the long term, we've been able to make a lot of money for our shareholders and for our company by maintaining our discipline.
Joseph Stivaletti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Are there any particular areas, whether it's geographic areas, product-type areas that would be -- that are sort of higher up on the priority list as you consider potential acquisitions?
John A. Hayes: Well, our pipeline, I think, is full of everything. Everything from aerospace -- in January, we made a very small acquisition and that's gone exceedingly well. And so that was more trying to get into a new customer base. On the packaging side, whether it's geographic -- we've talked about the need for consolidation in China, in particular. I think over the longer term, there could be opportunities there. I think there's further rationalization opportunities in some of the more mature markets and mature product lines, and we're focused on those. But the one thing about acquisitions that we've realized is, if you overpay for an acquisition, in our markets, it's always very, very difficult to get it back. And so that's why we've been maintaining a disciplined approach.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Punjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just kind of judging by your customer comments, whether it's branded or private label, it seems like most of your customers were surprised at the rapid decline in diet soda over the summer, and I guess that's been true for the full year as well. John, can you just sort of touch on how your portfolio is positioned against that trend in terms of how it falls in North American footprint compared to the average, if you will, for diet soda as a function of the category? And also, are you seeing anything comparable in Europe as well in terms of declines in diet soda?
John A. Hayes: No. In fact, let me start with Europe first. No, in fact, the strength -- soft drink was stronger than beer, at large [ph] as an industry and for Ball in Europe during the third quarter. And I do think some of it has to do with market share gains and other things like that. I think here in North America, Ghansham, there are several things going on. The first half, there was some weather issues. There's also has been a pricing versus volume strategy, I think, of the soft drink industry generally speaking. But then it is also a demographic, and people are drinking less sodas and people are drinking less diet sodas. Diet soda is skewed towards the older consumer, and they've been drinking less. And so I think our customers are acutely focused on that from a product formulation perspective, as well as a channel perspective. You're seeing the -- many more different types of SKUs out in the marketplaces, our customers try and find the sweet spot relative to those various demographics. And I -- we expect a fair amount of innovation from a category perspective in 2014 because those customers are very much in tune with the macro trends going on.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of Europe, was there anything unusual for the industry as to why volumes were so strong? Because, again, kind of reverting to -- for example, Heineken, yesterday, they weren't exactly thrilled with the volume profile in Europe. So what drove the strength in Europe for the industry during the third quarter, you think?
John A. Hayes: It's always difficult to tell just in the quarter, but you're absolutely right. I think it has to do with -- the can has been winning relative to other packaging substrates. At the end of the day, we continue to see slow but steady in Europe. Slow but steady improvements in terms of cans as a share of the package mix, and that adds incremental growth to any of the liquid growth. So that's probably the biggest thing that's going on.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.
Danny Moran: This is Danny Moran in for Al this morning. Just one quick one for me. Did you receive any benefit from lower European metal premiums in the quarter? And can you give us any visibility on any potential tailwinds in '14?
John A. Hayes: No. The premiums just started to moderate in the quarter. And with the inventory that we are running through the system, we saw really, virtually, no benefit of that. It provides some potential upside next year if they keep moderating, but we're not -- we haven't until we bake that in. So no real impact in the third quarter. We're still seeing higher cost than we were a year ago.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was curious, if we could just go back to Europe one more time. I was wondering if there's any specific regions or countries where you're seeing this outsize growth? And then you talked about getting back to 11% to 12% margin in the region by 2014 and '15, but it appears we're already there. So I'm just wondering if this is sustainable in the near term?
John A. Hayes: Yes. First, the answer is, as I mentioned, the volumes were up nicely in the third quarter relative to where our strength is, which is really Germany, Benelux, France and the U.K. I do think some of that was a bounce back because the first half of the year was very tough. And as the summer came, I think there was just the consumer unleashing, if you will, of getting out and taking advantage of the weather. So I wouldn't read into that too much. Overall, as an industry, we're a little bit stronger than our long-term expectations. We've said 2% to 5% growth over the medium to long term in Europe, in part driven by the market share gains I've talked about for cans relative to glass and others. And that was kind of at the upper end. The growth was at the upper end up that, so I wouldn't read too much into it. And then -- I'm sorry, your second question, I forget now.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just talking about the margin and whether or not that's going to be sustainable in the near term, because I thought that we -- you had discussed at the Investor Day being more of a 2014, '15 event when we got back to 11% to 12% margins in that business.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Well, in the quarter, I know we are above that. But remember, we're a seasonal business, so we look at that on an annualized basis. What really drove the improvement in the third quarter, a little bit of cost out because there are folks who've been getting after that. But as we said, that's a longer-term issue. It was really that we have strong volume. And when you're in a volume-sensitive business, those things help. We had negative volumes in the first half of the year, and I think that hurt. But -- so I wouldn't read into that other than, number one, we are on track of what we said; and number two, these cost-out programs really to hit in a more meaningful way the second half of 2014 and 2015.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I guess my follow-up question is on Brazil. It appears the ramp-up is going as planned, but industry trends appear to be subdued right now. So I'm just trying to understand what gives you confidence that you will actually see a double summer materialize, even with the World Cup coming. Now what are your customers expecting? And I would expect that you guys are -- your volumes should outpace the industry given your new capacity, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think in Brazil, everyone, I believe, is very much looking forward to 2014. There's going to be a tremendous amount of promotional activity here. They're expecting millions of visitors, which is going to help. I think, to your point, we do have new capacity coming on. And as you know, this business is chunky, if you will. And when you have new capacity on, you're usually the ones grabbing the incremental growth in the near term. But I think over the long term, our competitors have grabbed some growth in the past when we weren't putting capacity in and they were. So I just think from our product perspective, our customer portfolio perspective, we're in pretty good shape for 2014 in Brazil.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And you're happy with your mix of specialty cans in that region?
John A. Hayes: Yes. We definitely are.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.
William Mitchell: This is actually William Mitchell filling in for Anthony. Just one quick one for you guys. How much of the volume growth in metal, food and household products was due to the annual food pack?
John A. Hayes: Well, we -- as Scott said, we were upper-single digits on volumes, and the overall market was up about 3%. It's interesting when you look at it, what was strong and what was weak relative to the industry. What was strong was the vegetable pack and pet food. And what was weak was fruit and soups. We do not participate in a large way in the fruit or the soups. And so I think we just benefited from a customer mix that had a strong pack. So what I'd say is all the growth we saw was related to the pack because that's the way the business works.
Operator: There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating. We look forward to what hopefully is a strong finish to 2013 and a more constructive 2014. And we look forward to talking to you in January.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 25, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Ciglund. And good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2013 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, then I'll finish up with comments of our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013. Now despite a very cold and damp spring, particularly in North America and Western and Central Europe, that resulted in volume declines for standard beverage cans in these regions, our second quarter results were largely in line with expectations. In fact, the soft demand resulting from the challenging weather and global economic malaise actually more than offset much of the good work and performance our various businesses have accomplished. Over the past month, we've begun to see more normalized weather patterns and slightly better demand than we saw in the second quarter, which if sustainable, should give us better visibility as we cycle into the second half of 2013 and, more importantly, into 2014. During the quarter, we tackled a variety of issues, including: aggressively addressing the unusually soft demand in our 12-ounce U.S. beverage container manufacturing output by permanently eliminating 12-ounce capacity in our Milwaukee, Wisconsin, facility; making progress on European cost-out plans through, among other items, announcing the consolidation of our former European headquarters in Ratingen, Germany, into our regional technical center in Bonn, Germany; as well as other G&A optimization measures. While we are working through the various approvals required, we expect this to be completed in the first half of 2014 and, combined with other cost-out and value-in initiatives, will help us to improve our fixed cost leverage in this segment. In Brazil, we are on track to complete the installation of a second line in our Alagoinhas beverage can manufacturing facility by early fourth quarter of this year, which positions us nicely as we look to the World Cup next summer. In Asia, we are in the process of relocating the capacity from our one-line facility in Shenzhen, China, to one of our existing locations there. This optimized footprint and better cost structure will position us nicely in the growing Southeast China region. Our food and household products business also had a good quarter, with volumes up 8%. And we are finalizing the installation of another production line in our Mexican impact-extruded facility. Lastly, in the quarter, we took advantage of attractive credit markets to increase our financial flexibility by amending and extending our credit facility, coupled with the issuance of $1 billion of 10.5-year senior notes at 4%. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our second quarter numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the second quarter were $0.85 versus last year's $0.89. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $32.6 million primarily related to business consolidation and debt refinancing costs. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down year-over-year. These results were slightly weaker than expectations given continued weak industry demand for our standard cans in North America where our volumes were down double digits in the quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter trend. From a manufacturing perspective, cost containment and operating performance at the plant level were exceptional in all regions, and specialty cans in the Americas continued to grow at a double-digit pace. The European segment profit declined in the quarter due to slightly lower volumes brought about by challenging economic and weather conditions, coupled with higher labor and input cost, both of which are being addressed aggressively. In food and household, year-over-year segment earnings were higher due to improving volume trends, our recently acquired Mexico plant and good performance in our steel and aluminum aerosol businesses. Segment volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and conditions leading into the seasonal fruit and vegetable pack are favorable. Transitioning from operations. During the quarter, our corporate undistributed costs were roughly in line with expectations, the effective tax rate was slightly lower than we anticipated and we repurchased a net $202 million of our stock. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.7 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 4.7x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA of 3.2x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $900 million. Given our seasonality and strong full year free cash flow, we anticipate year-end net debt levels to be in the range of $3.1 billion. For a complete summary of the second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP bases, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Moving on to financial metrics for full year 2013. Hardly any changes here. Interest expense will be in the range of $183 million due to some negative carry associated with the senior notes offering. Full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27% and full year corporate expense is expected to be around $73 million. CapEx is still in the range of $400 million, and free cash flow will be in the range of $450 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well in the quarter, with solid execution on existing programs, the award of a Korean environmental instrument and solid contracted backlog at $966 million. While backlog continues to remain at or near record levels, we have seen some slight delays in U.S. government contract awards due to the effects of sequestration. Our operating performance has been excellent, and we remain well positioned while continuing to monitor closely our timing of project starts as we move into the third quarter. Longer term, we are seeing a variety of opportunities both domestically and internationally that will continue to help grow our business and help mitigate any effects of sequestration. Now looking out across our company today, a few observations to share. Over the past month, we have seen some improvement in the demand for standard beverage cans in North America and Europe, although we are not planning to recoup the volume shortfall of the first half of the year. In our metal beverage Americas segment, a tremendous amount of great work has been done to arrest the volume issues we have been facing. And while it is not impossible, our ability to reach last year's profitability in this segment for the full year will be challenging. In Europe beverage, we have plans in place and are executing on a variety of cost-out and value-in projects, the majority of which will be realized in 2014 and 2015, which should get us back to operating margins consistent with the 2010-2011 period. Plantings to date related to the seasonal vegetable harvest for our food and household products business look good. And as of today, and if the weather holds for a strong pack, we should see continued good performance out of this business in the second half. Going forward, we also see some more upside, with the aluminum aerosol business performing well. In our aerospace business, Ball's strong performance and track record should keep us well positioned for the long term. So given all of this, we expect strong free cash flow, as Scott had mentioned; full year 2013 results to exceed full year 2012 comparable diluted earnings per share results; and a return to a more historical earnings per share growth in 2014. And with that, Ciglund [ph], we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: John, I think you mentioned you saw some pickup in the beginning of the third quarter, in demand in North America. I was wondering if you could just talk to us about that a little bit. Is it just weather returning more normal? Or are you actually seeing some pickup in promotional activity that's been relatively nonexistent? What exactly are you seeing there?
John A. Hayes: I think the vast majority of it has been weather related. As you know, the month of June, particularly the first half of the month of June, had the same trends in May being largely wet and even cold, and we've seen a more normalization of that. There has been a little bit more spot promotion, but that -- I think the vast majority of it is weather.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And when I look at your volumes, you said your 12-ounce volume was down double digit. I think the industry was down about 5% in the quarter. I know that 12-ounce is not your only offering. Can you talk about sort of how your volumes overall compared relative to the industry and maybe how your mix played into that somehow...
John A. Hayes: Well, yes. On the specialty side, we grew double digits again in this quarter, which was -- helped to offset our softness in the 12-ounce. And on an -- on a apples-to-apples comparison, if you exclude the business that we lost last year, we were about down on the 12-ounce side equal to the industry, and then you just compound that with the business we walked away from. And that's why we were a little bit worse than the market.
Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just lastly, the facility or the -- you said you were going to eliminate a 12-ounce line in Milwaukee. Is there anything left of that facility? Are we closing a full facility? And if so, what will you think about cost reduction?
John A. Hayes: No, that was one of our facilities that the -- we shared with the metal food business. And we make 2-piece food cans there as well. And we've right-sided the G&A part of that business as we go forward as best we can. But we are still making 2-piece food cans there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: On -- first on Brazil, a lot of your packaging peers have reported challenges there in the beverage business, whether it's weather or the economy or social unrest or whatever the reason. Can you just give us your perspective on the market and then how you're thinking about the upcoming selling season in 4Q and 1Q?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Actually, we feel reasonably bullish on what's going down in Brazil. As you know, we started up a new facility beginning of this year. Our plans are on track for adding a second line in. Our customer base, which is at times different than maybe some of the people you're referring to, has been reasonably strong. We're well diversified into the Northeast and to -- and then down into the South. So overall, we feel pretty good. And as you know, we're just -- it's beginning of their spring right now, so we're starting to get into the heavier selling season. And with the startup of the second line in Alagoinhas, I think we feel pretty good, particularly going into the World Cup in 2014.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then on the beverage can business as a whole, how should we think -- kind of think about inventories across North America and Europe given all the challenges you faced during the first half? I guess I'm asking because should we expect below-average operating rates during the third quarter. Or is it pretty well sort of aligned by now?
Scott C. Morrison: We're managing that as we go along in the year, actually. And so inventory rates are a little bit higher than where we expected them to be given the softness in volume and -- but we kind of monitor that as we move throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I had a couple of questions, to start. Can you tell us, to the degree that you're looking at your headcount in aerospace, do you expect, given the opportunities you have in the next couple of years, that you'll be able to maintain your headcount within aerospace?
John A. Hayes: Yes. And in fact, even year-to-date, we're up slightly in the aerospace business because we've been winning work. And -- but I think, as we go forward, George, we would continue to grow the headcount because you're going to see continued growth in revenue.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. No, and that's the point I was trying to get at. So if -- that's a good sign that your headcount is up right now and suggests that, whatever you're seeing out of sequestration, you're being able to manage it with other opportunities. That would be fair?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes.
John A. Hayes: Yes, it is fair. You know what, as you know, our backlog is down slightly from the last quarter, but the real issue is we've been burning off backlog and the government hasn't made any decisions because many of their employees have been furloughed. And so the decisions are just being slowed but our contracted work is still going well.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And now the next question I have for you and Scott, you made the comment about you're working very hard to arrest the decline in 12-ounce beverage can. You obviously shut the line in Milwaukee. You've been doing other activity to shift your mix to specialty cans. But aside from that, is there anything that you're seeing either from your customers to support growth rates, either for mega beer or for softdrinks, or anything that you're doing within 12-ounce, or cans broadly, to support growth there?
John A. Hayes: We've been doing a lot, but let's first start with the customers. As you know, the end markets, beer is down 2.5%, 2.6%, and that's the biggest decline that they've had in a long time. And so they've been doing a lot of innovation work trying to arrest the demographic change: as people get older, they've been drinking less beer; but also the shift to spirits and wines because they very much have been focused on the value side, the pricing side, relative to volume. I think the same thing holds true on the CSD. And as you know, CSD has been challenged. It's a little bit more sensitive to economic issues, and I think this payroll tax has hurt them a little bit more. The pricing strategies, they very much have been focused on. And so CSD is down in overall category, a little bit more than beer. I think both of those segments, the -- our customers are very much focused on the long-term aspects of this because that's where a lot of their value is derived from then. So just based on first- and second-hand knowledge of working with those customers, they are trying to put some more excitement into their categories. Some of it has to do with innovation and coming out with their new products. Some of it has to do with innovation around packaging. And some of it has to do with innovation about placements. And so I think they're very much focused on all those. And as you know, innovation is a key part of our strategy, and so we've been helping them on that.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, I thought I saw a headline recently about you using a straw-in-can innovation in Europe. I -- correct me if I'm wrong, but if that is correct, do you have the ability to do that here in the States as well? And is there any interest in that?
John A. Hayes: We do have the ability to do that in the States, yes. And we don't think that's going to be a huge discriminator, but yes, we can do it in the United States.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Last question, and then I'll turn it over. There's obviously been a lot discussed about, some relevant, maybe, some maybe not, but in terms of your potential customer loss in a couple of years. Can you update us with kind of the latest you can provide in terms of how you plan to deal with that potential customer loss or that actual customer loss in '15? And what actually have you garnered already, or progress, in terms of refilling?
John A. Hayes: Well, it's premature to tell the outside world what we're doing, but we definitely, George, have plans in place to recover most, if not all, of that loss from a profit perspective. I'm not talking about from a volume perspective. Our volume will be down, but we're here to make money, not necessarily only to make cans. And so at the appropriate time, we'll be talking about it. I just think it's premature based on some of the activities and the impact that has to be talking about it on this call today.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Philip Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question. John, you talked about some nice margin recovery opportunity in Europe. It sounds like you're kind of targeting something in the 12% range, which would be maybe 200 to 300 basis points higher than where you are now. And you've talked about a variety of different factors that have driven the results so far this year. So I guess my question is, if you could parse out for us, what part of that recovery comes from just cost-out and those types of opportunities versus things like getting more price to recover the input cost inflation you've been seeing from metal premiums and other things to get there? That would be helpful.
John A. Hayes: Yes, let me, first clarify. I think when I talked about the 2010-2011 time frame, it's closer to 11% to 12%. You're at the high end of that. And I wouldn't disagree that's an aspiration, but it's going to take an awful lot of hard work to get to that. But having said that, the types of initiatives we have ongoing is taking a look at our G&A headcount. And as part of that, it's not only about the headcount, it's about how we conduct our various processes, whether it's payroll processes, whether it's credit collections, all those various things. We think there's a lot of opportunity to move to more of a truly pan-European approach to that and take a lot of cost out. I think we have a lot of opportunity on the freight side and the logistics side of the business in optimizing that, and we're doing a lot of activities there. We have some other cost activities at the plant level, although as Scott mentioned, the plants are performing very well from a manufacturing perspective. And then last but not least, the value-in is about trying to get paid for what we think is good value and also looking at our mix issues. So it's a combination of a whole host of things that we think, over the next 2-plus years, will get us there.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Thanks for the clarification on that number. I think I hadn't stripped out aero can. But so what you're saying is you don't need price to recover the input costs, as part of this plan?
John A. Hayes: Not completely. We're -- put it this way: We're not relying on it, but we're certainly focusing on it.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then the second question is just -- you talk also about the framework for 2014 kind of being in place with the long-term view of kind of a 10% to 15% EPS growth. So I guess that what I was wondering there is just, as you think about the drivers of that and what will you continue to see from the volume side of the equation, what kind of volumes do you feel like you need to assume for regions like Europe and North America to get to that kind of target? I mean, if North America is going to continue to be down, let's say, 2% to 3%, can you still get there? Or do we need something closer to flat in North America to reach that type of a target?
John A. Hayes: No. I think, from a big picture, we need -- kind of need more normalized volumes that we've seen over the past couple of years. And what that means, in North America, it's probably down 1% to 2%, maybe even 3%. It's the 6 -- 5% or 6% declines that really put a -- makes it challenging. But as you've seen, we've take -- been able to take out a tremendous amount of fixed cost in our business. In Europe, we're kind of focusing on the more traditional growth, call it the 2% to 5% growth. It's an even year next year. And putting weather aside, with the World Cup, those are big drivers for European beverage can growth, as well as Latin American beverage can growth. And with it being in Brazil, I think there is some upside there. China, all the trends that we've talked about in the past continue to go forward. So in order to achieve the -- our long-term targets in 2014, we just need a more normalized set of volumes that we have not experienced in the first half of this year.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. The last question is just, one of your peer companies was talking about significant underproduction in areas like France, for beer, in the second quarter. And I didn't know if maybe it's -- there are some elements of that, that were impacting you more than just the general volume trends. And if you could give a number for how Europe did in the quarter, that would be helpful.
John A. Hayes: The overall European volumes were down less than 1%, so I don't know, 0.8%, something like that. That's -- the 2 big areas that hurt us the most probably were Germany and France just because the weather in Germany, as well as some of the things -- I don't think we were directly impacted or specifically impacted by the beer issue in France you just mentioned, although we -- there was somewhat of an impact. But it's even softer and [indiscernible] relatively flat, if not down slightly, in France as well. So I think it's Germany and France. And as we said, looking forward, if we're able to get some of this weather normalized and they're not underwater in Central Europe and wearing parkas in May, like they were in Germany, we feel okay about where we stand today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Heading into the year, demand-supply was pretty tight in Europe on the bev can side, and things are still pretty tight, I would imagine, and you had some aspirations of getting some incremental pricing in 2014. In light of the recent pullback on demand and one of your competitors adding capacity in the U.K. region, is that a -- is there some concern on the pricing front on 2014? Or should we see some upward trajectory from here?
John A. Hayes: Well, as I said earlier about our cost-out and value-in initiatives, we are not planning on it. It is always challenging. It's too early to say what we're going to be able to achieve, but we are -- we have not been adding any capacity ourselves. And we are focusing on trying to recover some of those costs that we've mentioned before, but it's too early to predict victory.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got you. And then can you give us a little preview on CapEx guidance for 2014? And should we expect free cash flow getting back to that $500 million range for next year?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, this is Scott. As always, on CapEx, it's dependent on what kind of good growth opportunities we see around the world. But with the world being a bit slower, I would see CapEx trending down meaningfully in 2014.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. Do you have a number for us? Or is it still...
Scott C. Morrison: No, not yet, because it's really early. So we're still expecting to spend -- remember, we've got, this year, we had $100 million of carry-in capital to this year, so it's unusually high. And I don't think we'll have that much carry-in capital into next year because most of the capital that we're spending will be concluded by this year. And so I'd see it dropping by a fairly sizable number next year.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got you. And then, John, I think, in the past you have mentioned that when the macro environment does slow down, that's been a pretty good time for you to get more active on the M&A front. Have you seen now that pipeline improve a bit here?
John A. Hayes: Yes, well, we -- as always, we have a variety of conversations going on. And as you know, it's been a cornerstone of how we've created value over the long term. And that hasn't changed at all. I don't think we have anything to report at this time, however, but you just never know. You always -- my predecessor always said you need motive and opportunity. And I think we have the motive, we're just making sure the opportunity is right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. First, I missed a few sets of numbers, I think, in here, but did you give us what your volumes were like in Europe and in Brazil specifically...
Scott C. Morrison: In Europe, they were down less than 1% in the quarter. And in Brazil, they were up double digits high. It was very strong. Remember, we had capacity that came online this year with our new plant. And we'll have another new -- or a new line coming on in the fourth quarter of this year.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. As we look at your performance here in North America in beverage cans and we look to your performance in Europe in beverage cans, you've been a bit below the market in Europe and a good chunk below the market here in North America. While I do recognize there's been some customer shift back and forth, but maybe more specifically, over the last couple of years, you've seemingly had to take a disproportionate amount of the capacity out in North America or maybe not grow as fast as some of the other folks in Europe. Is there anything that's changed in the competitive landscape that maybe has put you at a bit of a disadvantage, whether it's how you're going to market with pricing or whether it's what-have-you that may account for that? And how might that, or can that, change going forward, I mean? Or is it just simply a position of doing what your customers or your set mix is?
John A. Hayes: Well, let me try and tackle that. It -- because I think there are 2 answers for each -- there's a different answer for each of the regions. In North America, we've been trying to take a very disciplined approach as the market leader. And we've been putting our money where our mouth is in terms of capacity. I do think that, if you separate this onetime item that we lost last year, on an apples-to-apples basis, we're right there with everything else. And in fact, we're probably even a little bit ahead because of the specialty growth. So I wouldn't read into that too much. And I think it really was a onetime item. And when you look into Europe, I would -- I certainly wouldn't agree with, over the last couple of years, anything has been happening, that has disadvantaged us. It's really been over the last 6 months, and it has to do with weather and geographic footprint. And everyone knows that Western and Northwest Europe in particular have been much more heavily hit than Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. And so when you look country by country and category by category, where we were off slightly relative to the market, had to do with the geographic proximity.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. Last question I had is, you spoke about getting back to in the corridor of your traditional earnings growth rates in 2014. With some of these factors, weather now seemingly getting better, along with your comments earlier about better 12-ounce and some of these other factors seeming to improve here in the back half of the year, is it feasible that you could get back to 10% to 15% earnings growth per quarter the back half of this year?
John A. Hayes: I think it's too early to say. Certainly, what we've told in guidance was we said the full year '13 will be higher than the full year '14. And if you look, we're down in the first half of '13 versus first half of '12. So by definition, we have to be up in the second half of '13. I think it -- we feel good about the efforts that we can control. It really is a volume game. And we feel okay right now, but you know how volatile the weather has been here in North America and in Europe. And so I know that probably doesn't directly answer your question, but that's where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: John, one of your competitors this morning talked about a mix shift toward can that tends to occur whenever economies weakened, as they have recently. Have you seen any evidence of such a shift recently? Or would you expect one in the developed markets?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think, on the beer side, it hasn't -- over the last 5 years, I think beer cans, as a share of the package mix in the beer category, has gone from, call it, 47% to 53%. So we've actually seen some relative health on cans. I do think you're seeing a resurgence on cans, particularly on the beer side. Think about all of the activity that's been going on on the craft side of the market, and you're even starting to see them in the on-premise. And so I think that is constructive. I do think it has more to do with where the customers are pointing to and a little bit less to do with the overall economies because what I would tell you is it has to do, in part, with what the pricing strategy of the beer makers is as well. And over the last few years, on the value side of beer, they've been pushing price up more than they have on the premium side.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: No, that's helpful. And just one on the mix, the mix in Brazil. Have you seen any recent trends there in terms of a continued mix shift toward cans and away from returnable bottles?
John A. Hayes: A little bit, yes. It's -- there's not that many one-way bottles down in Brazil. It's largely returnable. And we, again the share is a package mix, over the last couple of months, I don't think we've seen wholesale change. But certainly, over the last 5 years, that's one of the big drivers of the beverage can in Brazil, and now it's up in the upper 30s. And hopefully, as we go into 2014, with the World Cup and the other things, hopefully it will start with a 4, but it's premature to declare that. But we have been seeing good growth in the beverage can relative to overall industry beer growth.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And one last one. Any notable change in the competitive dynamics in China as of late? I know you talked about the supply-demand imbalance getting a bit better in the second quarter.
John A. Hayes: Yes, no, nothing to update. The market continues to grow strongly. I think, the balance, some of this excess capacity is being soaked in. I do think that we haven't seen any -- certainly any more downside relative to prices, but we haven't yet seen any upside relative to pricing either.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Al Kalibi (sic) [Kabili] with Macquarie.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: I guess, John, a question on the European cost saves. And I know most of this is really in '14. But incrementally, what's the opportunity to ramp that up a little bit more in the -- I mean, the back half of '13?
John A. Hayes: Well, the biggest issue, I think, it has to do is things happen more slowly in Europe because of the works councils and because of the union and how you deal with the various people component of it and where to do it the right way. And that just takes time. So that's probably the biggest reason is that [ph], and combined with some of the other cost initiatives. As Scott had mentioned, in the plants, we're doing a very good job, and it's been offsetting some of the softness in Northwest Europe from a volume perspective. But I think that's the main reason. The reason why I just said on the labor side is why we don't expect to see a tremendous amount of upside in the second half of '13.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: And then secondly, you mentioned on the aerospace side the sequestration and the impact on new awards. Are you seeing any impact on the pace of your backlog burn at this point? And what do you see the risk to the current backlog that you have?
John A. Hayes: I think our current backlog is pretty solid right now. And in fact, we were just speaking about that the other day. I think the biggest issue is just with the government. There's 2 things going on: Number one, the overall budgets are declining. And I won't go into the details here, but if you're a program of record, you're relatively solid. And most, if not all, of our backlog is programs of record, which is good. I think, in terms of new awards, in terms of new initiatives, those are the things that are a bit slower. And it's slower because, number one, the government has less money, so they need to figure out efficiencies to find money to fund those. But then, number two, because of the short-term nature of sequestration and the furloughing of employees, people who had been working 40, 50, 60 hours a week to try and process some of this stuff are now working 25 to 35 hours a week and so there's just not as -- it just takes longer to get things through the system.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then along those lines, you mentioned the small international award that you recently booked. And it's pretty small, but I guess it's notable because that's something you've talked about looking to do, is expand internationally on the aerospace side. And just what's the outlook there?
John A. Hayes: Well, we actually are bidding on more international opportunities than we ever have in the history of Ball aerospace right now. They have to come to fruition, but it's really based upon some of the nonclassified technologies that we have developed in that business and the global need for some of those things, first. So for example, this environmental satellite we're building for the South Koreans was based on some things we've done for the U.S. government over here. And as we look in other places of the world, we think there's opportunities for things like that in terms of environmental monitoring and other technologies.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then final question is just the Vietnam JV that I know is small, but I wanted to just get an update there and if you see that as a springboard to further expand into Southeast Asia.
John A. Hayes: Yes, well, it's been up and running a little over a year now, and it's making good progress. We were there a couple of weeks ago. And I think it's an excellent facility. And if any of you are ever in Southeast Asia, we'd be happy to give you a tour of it. I do think that it's not just a Vietnamese joint venture, but it's more as part of a regional strategy. We have an interest in one of our partners in Thailand as well. And so that whole region, when you look at a map, it's not just one country versus another country, it's a regional perspective. And so yes, there could be opportunities going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: In the food can business, you referenced high-single-digit growth. And I'm wondering if there are specific categories in which you're doing well, if you had kind of a preliminary view on the pack season. And then you -- there's a competitor that's discussed maybe some food can business being shifted from 3Q to 4Q because of a potentially later pack or delayed pack, and I'm just wondering if you had any view on that in the back half of the year.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, the -- our numbers were up high to mid single digits in the quarter. And we feel pretty good about where the pack is at now. And we're getting more normalized weather. The Southeast in the last couple of years has been just horrendous, and this year, it's been more stabilized. But I would agree with the comment in terms of pushing more into the fourth quarter from the third quarter: We expect third quarter to be solid, but there's probably more that will benefit us in the fourth quarter of this year.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to the aerospace side. You discussed some of the headwinds with sequestration. And I guess earnings in the segment were kind of flattish sequentially with the first quarter. I'm wondering, as we look forward to 3Q, 4Q, is that kind of $19 million type run rate a decent estimate for 3Q, 4Q? Or could we see a little bit more of a pickup? Or is it kind of too soon to tell?
John A. Hayes: I think, to answer to your question, it's probably a decent run rate. We had talked on prior calls that, in 2012, we had a number of close-outs on some programs that we had executed very well on. And that provided some upside in 2012. With the startup of many of these new programs in 2013, these are 3-, 4-, 5-year contracts, and so as -- the way we do it, as we reduce the risk, if you will, the execution risk in those, the accruals change. And so you usually make more profits in the back end of programs if you're doing well, as opposed to the front end. And so the fundamentals of the business in '13 are quite good. But really, where you're going to see that profitability, assuming we're actually executing, it really starts to ramp up in '14 and '15 relative to the current run rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the next question. [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: 2 strategy questions or bigger picture questions. First, in aerosol, the company's technology bed, if you will, is on impact-extruded aluminum. And thus far, that's been a good place to be given your performance, from what we could see in Aerocan. Are there other technologies that are viable in the aluminum aerosol can market that you need to be mindful of that maybe could start to pick up share? Would you have the ability to adopt other technologies to make aluminum aerosol cans in quick order if you needed to?
John A. Hayes: The short answer to that, George, is we have a variety of technologies we've been working on, on the aluminum aerosol side, even the steel aerosol side, that we feel very confident that they have some interesting developments. It's premature to talk about those, but as we move forward, I think you're going to see some things where it's leveraging our D&I capabilities in the aerosol sector. And it -- we're excited about the promise of that. As you know, we're already doing that in terms of the Alumi-Tek bottle with MillerCoors. And we have some other interesting things. And then even on the impact-extruded side is we've talked about having our ReAl slugs, which is a much lighter-weight slug, by utilizing some of our technology that we've morphed from our beverage can business. So we've got a variety of things that we have been actively looking at. Some are commercialized right now, and others could be commercialized in the future.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Would it be fair to say that doing a D&I aluminum aerosol can is probably a couple of years away? Next month? I mean, how would you ballpark it for us if you could? If you could.
John A. Hayes: Well, it's -- D&I aerosol is challenging just because the pressure is held in aerosol and you need to make sure that the, well, wall thickness will withstand that. But that's one of the areas we're working on, but it is premature to say when it might be out.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Understood. The other question I had is around return and EVA. And obviously, Ball Corp., going back to the 1990s, has been really a pioneer on EVA. It's worked very, very well for you. And I was looking on my model, and historically, the big jumps-up for you have come with things like a Reynolds, like Schmalbach. It's not been the only thing, but it's been where you've gotten the outsized pickups in economic profit. As we sit here and think about the next 2 to 3 years for Ball Corp., should we expect that more of your economic profit improvement, which I would imagine you think you will improve from these levels, will come from what you do with the balance sheet in terms of capital allocation, buying back stock, versus other source of capital? Or do you think that the investments that you've made and could make would be the bigger driver of economic profit, say, between end of '13 and, say, of '15 or '16 in terms of time frame?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, first, I mean, EVA is still the big driver of how we decide in what to invest and how to invest. And I think it's a combination of the things that you talked about. It's going to be the capital allocation that we've done in the past; the returning -- absent other opportunities, returning a lot of cash to shareholders. We feel real good about the EVA returns of the investments that we've been making. Even in -- and if you'd look at the North American beverage business that shrunk this year, their EVA returns are getting better. And so the returns that we're getting on those incremental investments have been very attractive. So I think it's a combination of continued focus on EVA and making sure that we're getting the returns. As John mentioned, acquisitions have always been part of our strategy, and that's -- that continues to be. And that's allocating capital in a balanced way and in a disciplined way that we've done in the past and we'll continue to do in the future.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So you think your investment will be able to at least keep up with the buyback component of EVA. Would that be fair if we look out the next 3 years?
John A. Hayes: Its opportunity depends -- this is the way I'd look -- I'd think about it: There's kind of 3 different buckets of EVA. It's, number one, what you have right now. And what we're trying to do is improve the profitability and minimize the investment there. And that generates excess EVA dollars. Number two in this -- the number two and number three both get to capital deployment, but number two is what Scott said, it's more the expanding into new geographies, expanding into new products, it's the specialty container that we've talked about that generate returns in excess of that capital. So you're putting more capital to work. And then the last but not least are kind of the big hitters, as you described, that aren't lost on us which are putting an even greater amount of capital to work through acquisition. And the only thing you really need to be focusing there on is making damn sure that the capital you're putting to work there can generate that excess return. So we think about it in those 3 buckets. So, what are we doing right now in terms of improving our business? What are we using our cash flow for, and is it returning it and reducing the investment to our shareholders? Or is it investing in new internal growth opportunities, or is it on the M&A side?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly on this, guys, and I promise I will give it up here. Scott, you said your EVA returns, if I heard you correctly, in North America are up this year. Did I hear that correctly? And does that include even the cost or the cash flow outlay for integration?
Scott C. Morrison: The cash flow outlay for -- you're talking about restructuring costs?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, I mean, the -- yes, exactly.
Scott C. Morrison: Restructuring costs get capitalized, so you still have to pay for those over time.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Exactly. So what's -- even including that in your EVA calculation, you were up in terms of EVA returns in North American beverage.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, that's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, just a few cleanups. First of all, the aluminum storage situation has been in the news a lot the last week. Anything new there from your perspective?
John A. Hayes: As people know, there was a big article in the New York Times on Sunday about the issues on metal premiums and LME, and it's been widely discussed. And we do know that there were some governmental hearings on Tuesday. I probably shouldn't comment on them because I wasn't purposefully there. But there has been issues there, and I do think it's getting more focus to make sure that there's a level playing field around how metal is purchased on a global -- aluminum is purchase on a global basis. So that's probably all I should say. Scott, anything...
Scott C. Morrison: No. As I said, they -- we're -- we've been involved in those conversations because we think that there are -- better transparency around how the warehouses work will be beneficial to the industry and to -- ultimately, to consumers.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Second question, that 8% volume gain in food and household in the second quarter, any sense of what you would expect there for the full year?
Scott C. Morrison: We said, for the full year, we'll be up slightly, but it's not going to be at that kind of a pace.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, any thoughts on specialty can margins in North America and Europe and where you see those moving over time?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think we talked about this on the call last time. We haven't seen any changes up or down relative to them. As the specialty canned -- can's market size gets bigger, it's logical to think, from an economic perspective, it may put some downward pressure on volumes. But from an overall profit pool perspective, I think it will continue to grow.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then final, you guys didn't make this, but there's a "bow tie can" that was out there. Do you have any sense of, like, what that actually did for volume for the brewer involved? As just one example of...
John A. Hayes: We'd be speculating if we said anything.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: You mentioned several times on the call that the volumes thus far in July are tracking better and improved weather is really the key reason. So in places like North America and Europe where the improvement in the weather seems most obvious, can you just actually tell us how your volumes are tracking on the beverage side thus far in July?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think, nothing else to add. You just summarized it. I think, particularly in North America and Europe, they are more normalized or becoming more normalized, which means we weren't seeing those huge -- the month of June was very soft from a North American perspective. I don't have the numbers in front of me from an industry perspective, but they were in excess, I believe, of the 5.5-or-so percent decline for the quarter. And so what we've seen is more moderation of that. I would not say it's anything to go home and get overly excited about, however. All we're saying is they've returned to more historical normalcy.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, John. And then I know you're running pretty full, but where do you see utilization rates for the market in China as a whole? And where do you think they need to go to before pricing power begins to shift back to the suppliers?
John A. Hayes: Well, they're somewhere in the 80s right now. And it depends by in the -- upon region, and it depends on what you assume that -- the actual output versus the rated output of some of these new competitors in there. I do think, you look at any in the -- any in -- region in our industry, and the minute you can start to get to the upper 80s or lower 90s, that's when you start to see tightness in the market, because there is -- as you all know, there is a seasonality effect.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. That's make sense. And just sort of a last quick one from me: In North America where it's-- the standard 12-ounce can is going down pretty significantly for you in '13, and specialty continue to go, where do you see the mix between the 12-ounce specialty can as you end 2013?
John A. Hayes: Probably in the low 20s, specialty as a percent of total mix.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Philip Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just one very quick follow-up just around this normalization of volumes. If I look at Europe in the third quarter of last year, if I have this correct, Scott, you guys were up almost 10% in European beverage, so I just want to kind of clarify what kind of normalization would mean for you guys in Europe against that type of a comp.
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I think what we're talking about normalized volumes is that low- to mid-single-digit growth rates. Kind of that 2% to 5% growth rate would be normalized.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, so you would -- you would see the ability to do that in the third quarter despite the comps.
John A. Hayes: Yes.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. We should be more -- it, again, all depends on weather. But we should be more in line with the market if weather is normalized.
John A. Hayes: And then at -- I don't have last year's numbers in front of us. The 10% seems high.
Scott C. Morrison: It seems high.
John A. Hayes: I thought it was low to mid single digits the third quarter last year. But perhaps you can give Ann Scott a call and clarify that.
Scott C. Morrison: In Q2 of last year, we were up just a couple percent, so I -- you might have a bad number there.
Operator: And there seems to be no further questions at this time, sir.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Well, thanks, Ciglund. And thank you, everyone. I just want to remind everyone that Ball we will be hosting at Investor Day and Management Briefing in Midtown Manhattan on October 2 and 3. Analysts and institutional investors should contact Ann Scott for an invitation. We thank you for participating on today's call. And we're looking forward to seeing you all in early October and then on the call at the end of October. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 25, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, President and COO with Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Daisy, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2013 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on this call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013. We've made a lot of progress towards our longer-term objectives in the majority of our businesses, including our ability to overcome the shortfall created from the previously announced 12-ounce customer shift in North America. However, disappointing results in our European beverage container segment overshadowed this good work and led to our first quarter results coming in below our expectations. We will discuss this more when I talk about the outlook later in the prepared remarks, but the overarching business fundamentals at Ball have not changed. And while we have dug ourselves a hole in the first quarter, we do expect the remainder of the year to be largely consistent with our expectations, although the year is probably more back-end weighted as volumes in the second quarter are getting off to a slow start and our cost out plans in Europe will take time. Other events in the quarter included, we successfully integrated our recently acquired Mexican extruded aluminum aerosol business, which brings a new growth platform and a new region for Ball. We began installation of a second beverage can line capable of making multiple specialty can sizes in our new Alagoinhas, Brazil facility. Volumes for us in Brazil were up strong double digits for the quarter. We're aggressively managing our manufacturing footprint by announcing that we will cease production at our Elgin, Illinois steel aerosol packaging plant later this year, as well as redeploying beverage and manufacturing equipment from our Gainesville facility to existing facilities in the U.S. We are launching exciting new beverage can innovation, resulting in a leading U.S. craft brewer, offering their beer in cans for the very first time. And we continue to leverage Ball Aerospace's technology expertise by maintaining more than $1 billion of contracted backlog despite the ongoing effects of sequestration. We are encouraged by the operating performance across the vast majority of our businesses. And as you can see, we have cost issues in Europe. The consolidation of the Ratingen and Bonn locations is the first step of many activities over the balance of the year to ensure we're as cost competitive as we can be. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review our first quarter numbers.
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter were $0.58 versus last year's $0.63, an 8% decrease. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $16 million, related mainly to costs associated with plant closures and the European headquarters relocation to Switzerland. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were roughly flat year-over-year due to shifting mix to specialty cans and excellent cost control at the plant level, offsetting double-digit declines in 12-ounce can demand in North America. Brazil volumes were up 40-plus percent in the quarter. China volumes were up mid-teens, but pricing in the region remains difficult. European segment profit declined $0.06 in the quarter due to weaker volumes brought about by challenging economic and weather conditions in Northern and Western Europe, higher costs related to our regional headquarters move and higher input costs. In food and household, year-over-year segment earnings declined slightly due to higher cost inventory carried into the year, and segment volumes declined 5% in the seasonally weak quarter with food cans down a bit more, which we expect to end up flat by year end and steel aerosol up mid-single-digits in the quarter. Extruded aluminum containers continue to grow globally. Also in the quarter, we were notified by a food can customer of their decision to shift buying from Ball to a new supplier beginning no earlier than 2015. While this is a ways away, we do not expect this shift to be material to the company's results in 2015. We have new things in the pipeline to deliver value-added packaging to other customers. And as always, we will actively manage our manufacturing footprint to enhance returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, we had 2 fewer accounting days as a result of moving to a quarterly calendar closing schedule, and our effective tax rate was lower than expected due to lower taxes on foreign earnings and benefits of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.4 billion due to normal seasonal working capital build and nearly $90 million of pension plan contributions during the quarter. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 4.9x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.1x. Given our seasonality and strong full year free cash flow, we anticipate year-end net debt levels to be in the range of $3.1 billion. For a complete summary of the first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Moving onto the financial metrics for full year 2013, hardly any changes here. Interest expense is expected to remain flat with last year. The effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 28%. We believe full year corporate expense to be in the range of $70 million due to onetime costs related to the impact of retiree and other deferred comp elections, primarily in the first quarter. CapEx is still expected to be in the range of $400 million, and the free cash flow will be in the range of $450 million. Our disciplined capital allocation remains with the majority of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On balance, absent the disappointment in Europe, the remainder of the business is on track with our expectations. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well with solid execution on existing programs and contracted backlog running slightly to $1.70 billion. As in the past, being cost competitive has allowed Ball to win our fair share of government contracts. And despite some minor slippage in some of our more tactical products related to sequestration, we remain well positioned. After a long and very successful career at Ball Aerospace, Dave Taylor retired at the end of the first quarter. We thank him for his significant contributions to our company and wish him well in retirement. Dave hands the reins over to Rob Strain, who joined aerospace as Chief Operating Officer in early 2012, and is doing a great job in what has been a very smooth transition. Now looking out across the operations today, a few observations to share. First, we continue to expect the Americas Asia segment earnings to be relatively flat in 2013. Specialty can growth in North America and Brazil is strong, and cost out initiatives are on plan, which are expected to offset anticipated lower volumes for 12-ounce containers in North America and difficult pricing in China. In Europe beverage, given existing challenges and the time required to achieve cost optimization across the region, we are unlikely to fill the first quarter performance hole in 2013. We anticipate seeing the benefits of ongoing cost-out initiatives later in the year end and into 2014. And as such, margins are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter. Going forward, our global food and household segment will benefit from increased demand for aluminum aerosol containers and the typical customer pull-through ahead for a normal seasonal vegetable harvest here in the United States. In our aerospace business, while some uncertainty still exists around future ramifications of sequestrations, Ball's strong performance and track record should keep us well positioned for the long term. With the exception of our European beverage business, remaining segments operating performance are expected and anticipated to be solid and should improve over the back half of the year. However, given our first quarter results and volumes in the second quarter are off to a slow start, it is unlikely we can reach our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal in 2013. Our company's cash flow is strong, and we are actively managing our businesses to align assets and cost structures to respond to current market conditions. This is a year where our attention to detail and focus on operational excellence are required to position us well for the long term. And with that, Daisy, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to start on Europe. These things happen obviously from time to time, and ultimately, you've had good performance in Europe over the years. It sounds like from listening and also reading through the press release that the issues in Europe, to some degrees, perhaps caught you by surprise. And so I was wondering if you could provide a bit more details in terms of what varied, if anything, from your expectations in the quarter. And then, again, if possible, on a forum like this, can you comment to the degree to which you ultimately see cost outs benefiting results? Obviously, it's not going to happen in second quarter, but in aggregate, say, by 2014.
John A. Hayes: Yes, George, this is John. There are several things that surprised us a little bit. The greatest of which, candidly, was probably volume. Recall in January, I had said that Europe, we were facing some issues in Europe, but we were coming off a year that we grew mid-single-digits. And in Western and Northern Europe, in particular, not only the economic climate, but they had a very long cold winter and beer was very soft, and we're weighted towards beer. And so we were down in the quarter, and that was a big issue, particularly when you're in a fixed-cost business. Having said that though, no excuses. We've got to be laser focused on improving our cost out. The shortfall was approximately 1/3 of volume and mix, 1/3 of labor efficiencies related to the move as Scott said, and then 1/3 related to higher costs, whether it was metal premiums, higher energy costs. And we are laser focused on getting those costs out of our system.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. The labor I'm assuming was related to what you needed to do once operating trends vary from what you were expecting. But the metal premiums, I'm not sure why that would have been any different than what you would have expected going into the year?
John A. Hayes: Well, we did. We did expect some higher energy and labor premiums that we're -- excuse me, metal premiums that we're having some challenges trying to push through into the marketplace. The labor efficiencies where we had redundant costs related to several opening up a new headquarters, and we hadn't yet closed the new headquarters, and those things just take some time and we had a little bit higher labor cost than we expected in that business. And so as I said, we're getting after that right now because we have to.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. John, I'd ask the question. I'm not sure you're in a position to answer it, so I respect that, but can you size what the cost outs might look like? If you mentioned already, I apologize for missing it.
John A. Hayes: No, I -- George, I do think it is premature to review that. Our folks are taking a full scrub, and we're going to be talking with them in the next couple of weeks about that. But we need to get the cost out. And look, this was a short-term blip and it had to do with -- it was the first time in a long time we actually had volumes decline in the quarter over in Europe. And so we need to make sure that our costs are as aggressively controlled and possible because you can't anticipate, given the economies of Europe, that we're going to see mid-double -- or mid-single-digit growth. And so we're planning for the worst, and then the rest is upside, if we can get after it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question is just the earnings outlook, not going to hit the 10% to 15%, understood. Should we be expecting EPS to be up year-over-year this year at this stage? And that's a question for the year, but also for the second quarter given what you're saying about trends and some of these cost variables, any color would be helpful.
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. Moving into the second quarter, it is starting off slower in terms of volumes. So I think the second quarter has got some challenges. Full year though, we're still expecting earnings per share to be up. We just said we're not going to hit our 10% to 15% long-term goal, but we expect it to be up.
John A. Hayes: Recall, Phil, that at the first quarter, we said we're going to be striving to reach the lower end of that range. And so if we made the $3 plus at the end of '12, you can do the math there. We've dug ourselves a $0.06 hole or so relative to that. And so -- but it's still -- we still are going to be striving to get as much as we can, it's just going to be difficult given the shortfall in the first quarter.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. And then on the free cash flow guidance, it sounds like you're keeping CapEx the same. So if earnings are expected to be lower, Scott, are there other levers you're pulling here to keep that free cash flow? Or did you have cushion in that original guidance? Or how should we be thinking about that?
Scott C. Morrison: We're finding some things on the working capital front that we can go after to make up for the shortfall in the earnings side. And right now, the CapEx plans that we have, the growth capital that we're spending on are projects that we like. It's a lot of specialty capacity in both North America and Brazil. And those projects have proven to be well worth investing in, and so we're going to be continue disciplined in deploying capital where we can find growth. It's probably the maintenance side where we can maybe shave a little bit out, but right now, we're keeping the number the same.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. Last question, just on the Europe mix issue, could you just elaborate on what that is? I assume it's specialty cans, but just kind of more detail in what you're seeing? And is that just seasonal or what is going on there?
John A. Hayes: Well, as I said, we're -- number one, we're more weighted to beer and beer is more weighted to $0.50 a liter. And so with the softness, overall -- I'll just give you context, overall, beer, industry beer cans in the first quarter in France was down about 8.5%; in Germany down about 7%; and Belgium down about 2.5 %, all largely related to the economy and weather. I mean, even in Germany, they were having snow in April, which is -- they haven't had in a long, long time. And so the mix issue is related to we were selling less beer, which is $0.50 a liter predominantly, and we're selling on a relative base, more $0.33 a liter, which is the standard container in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the metal premium issue in Europe. Is that -- because first I thought the contract's pretty much adjusted for any changes in metal prices. And the second is, is it related to steel versus aluminum?
Scott C. Morrison: It's not really related to steel versus aluminum, this is aluminum premium. And every contract is different. There are some contracts where it's a straight pass. There's other contracts that get negotiated on a shorter-term basis where all that has to get negotiated. And I would say we need to do -- we need to push more of getting that premium passed through. That's where we're getting squeezed a bit.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Is there -- are you going back to these customers and trying to get that contractually passed through on a go forward basis?
Scott C. Morrison: No, you have to honor the contracts that you have. But obviously going forward, you try to fix anything that's new that's coming up. Or if contracts need to change for whatever reason, that's high on our priority list of things to go after.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the -- you made a lot of management changes over the last year. A lot of people retired, so it's not as if the changes were made due to performance. But is there anything in the last quarter where maybe just because of management changes, the data wasn't flowing back as quickly as you would've expected? And so therefore, Europe surprised a little bit just from an information flow perspective?
Scott C. Morrison: I don't think it has anything to do with any management changes. I would say, if you're -- the one comment I made on undistributed cost being up a little bit, that has to do with a little bit with retirements, because of the way the deferred comp plans work and certain retiree elections. So it was a little bit higher in the first quarter, but I don't think there's any issue with -- we had a lot of changes last year in terms of going to the principal structure, moving our headquarters to Zurich. And when that -- and when something like that happens, I think you have a tendency potentially to lose focus a little bit. But I don't think it has to do with any personnel changes.
John A. Hayes: Yes. And the other thing I'd point out is when you looked at our volumes sequentially through the quarter, that actually in January, they were okay. And then it really started to get soft in February and even more so in March, and I think largely, it had to do with the prolonged winter.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. And just lastly, it's -- the facility that you're consolidating, is that -- that's just an administrative facility?
John A. Hayes: That's correct. It was our former regional headquarters and just outside of Düsseldorf.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: John, just judging by what your customers are also reporting, Heineken was out yesterday saying volumes were down 8% in Western Europe for the quarter. So obviously, they're seeing it and it's flown through the supply chain. Are you seeing any sort of -- are you sensing any sort of, re-think, in terms of promotional activity at their end as they sort of adjust to this new reality of what's happening in Europe?
John A. Hayes: Not yet, but what I will tell you, as a general rule, in the United States and in Europe, it's not lost on their customers that the volumes have been quite soft. Obviously, for different reasons, we've been focused in Europe on the weather; even here in the United States, not only weather, but the payroll tax. I think it's -- the impact on the consumer, it surprised people a bit more. So as we sit here thinking about promotional activity, it's very high on the minds of trying to get their volumes back. But I do think that we're just coming out of the winter time, and so it's really late in the second quarter is when you'll start to see those promotions. And the cycle of promotions is very different than it was, say, 5 years ago. They happen much more quickly, decisions are made much more quickly. And so I think it's going to be more of a tactical approach to promotions and advertising as well. I think you'll see a lot of marketing and advertising this summer in the beer category as well as the CSD category, both here in the United States and over in Europe.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just switching to Brazil, your 2 primary competitors down there seem to be focused on adding capacity in Northern Brazil. Can you just remind us on your Northern Brazilian strategy and how that sort of fits in with your plan for the region as a whole?
John A. Hayes: Well, we have. As you know, we started up a plant in the Northeast in Alagoinhas last year, and everything is going very well. And we, even in January, announced that we would, by later on this year, have a second line installed, and it was tied up under a long-term agreement and we have halfway through the execution there, and we expect probably late third quarter is when will -- that will get up and running. And so when you talk about North, I don't -- I wouldn't describe it as a Northern Brazil strategy, it's our Brazil strategy and a customer focused strategy. Right next to our Alagoinhas plants, 2 of our big customers have built brand-new breweries there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You guys are mentioning that your office slow start in 2Q. Can you provide a little color which businesses you're seeing a little more weakness from?
John A. Hayes: Well, relative to last year, I would say, here in North America, the beverage can volumes are a bit soft. I think if you look at IRI-type data, you can see just, again, the overall market is soft on the soft drink and beer side. I know that some of the soft drink companies over the last couple of weeks have talked about that. And then over in Europe, it's -- the winter was prolonged. I mentioned snow in Germany in mid-April. That's, in some ways, that's unprecedented, and so it's just a bit slow. But as we start to cycle into the summertime, it is weather dependent, but it was really those 2 things that I was referring to.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then on the food can business, I'm surprised to see some inventory holding drag from template. I would've thought template prices were pretty flat. Did you see a drop-off? Is that why there was a drag on the quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: There was just a little bit of that. It had to do with some higher cost inventory from how we ran from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Remember, we took a lot of downtime in the food can business in the fourth quarter last year and to manage inventories, and that helped generate some very good cash flows for us. But then -- so you're spreading a fixed-cost nut, if you will, over smaller volume, and that's where the higher cost of inventory flows through, and it's just -- it's a timing issue.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then just one last question on China. Demand's still pretty strong. One of your competitors mentioned that some of the regional players are having some execution issues, they're having some setbacks. So perhaps the excess capacity is not as bad as people have feared. Are you seeing that dynamic? And has that opened a door for you to win some new business? And what are your thoughts on pricing, I guess, potentially turning to the positive, going forward?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think all that you suggest is we would be at the same way. Meaning, volumes are -- continue to go strong. As we said, we're relatively sold out. We haven't added a lot of capacity in the market. And so as we go into the summer, it'll be interesting to see if there are indeed how tight the market gets. And we are going to take a very pragmatic approach to prioritizing our customer demand and how we supply that relative to where the economic returns are. And so we are going to make sure that our customers that want to be with us for the long term and aren't just tactical price buyers, we're going to focus on those relationships over the tactical price buyers.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got you. So it sounds like there is potentially some opportunity to get a little better pricing if things do firm up into the year, during the peak summer months then?
John A. Hayes: Yes, there could be. But again, it is a bit early and there are some operational problems. But the local competitors over in China, they're -- they have a capability of getting their act together. And so we'll see how the summer unfolds.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I was on a few minutes late, so I apologize if you addressed this. In light of the slightly softer guidance on the EPS line to get to the free cash flow number, are you planning to reduce CapEx a little bit? Or do you think you'll have a little bit better working capital managed? How do you think you will get there?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, it's still real early in year. But right now, we think we've got a little more upside in working capital than what we had. We didn't change our CapEx guidance for the year.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And then secondly on the aerospace division, if there were an impact or is going to be an impact from the sequester, when do you think that would both show up in the backlog and possibly in the actual results?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think there's 2 ways you got to think about this. The backlog we have is contracted backlog, and that's been increasing, and I think that's relatively solid. And so you wouldn't see anything, and that's a lot of the -- what I have described as the space hardware of what we do there. That's pretty firm, pretty solid, because these are satellites that need to be replenished, and we're not seeing any impact with respect to sequestration, at least right now, on that. On the more tactical products, the antennas for, say, the Joint Strike Fighter and other more tactical programs like that, we have seen a slippage to the right, not cancellations but a slippage to the right. That part of our businesses is certainly a much smaller part of the business than our space hardware. And so I think if you're going to see softness, you'll see it in that area.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. And then -- and again, I apologize if you addressed this, it seems like your experience in Europe, and I know that segments by company aren't apples-to-apples, but it seems like it's been a little bit tougher in the first part of the year than your other competitors. And could that be because of who your specific customers are or the mix of business with, say, soft drinks versus beer. Can you give us a little help with that?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I did address that earlier. So I'd ask you to go back when the transcripts comes out. But it really gets into the geographic location. Western Europe, France, Benelux region, Germany, that's a sweet spot for us, and where a lot of our production capacity and customers are. And it's -- we are focused on beer there. Given the weather and given the economic conditions, it was quite soft in those regions relative to some other regions.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And then last -- real quickly, more for Scott, is there any obvious or are there obvious things you're looking at to even further lower your debt cost, given this incredible environment? Or do you feel you've pretty much done all you can do?
Scott C. Morrison: No, we're always looking at the debt markets, and they've been very attractive lately. So we're always looking and we'll be opportunistic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: On Brazil, what were your like-for-like volumes in the quarter excluding the new plant? And what do you expect the market growth to be in subsequent quarters?
Scott C. Morrison: I don't have the like -- I mean, the year-over-year volumes were up 44%. Taking out the new capacity, I don't...
John A. Hayes: Yes, we were -- absent the new facility, we were sold out. And so we've been getting some productivity improvements there. But when you don't have anything else to sell, it's tough to sell more. And so -- hopefully, that addresses the first question. On the second question, we continue to see, I think, in the first quarter, industry volumes were up around 9% in Brazil. We're starting to enter their "winter" months. But I think all the prospects based on conversations with our customers and based upon the economic activity related to infrastructure builds for the World Cup next year, I think as we go through the back half of 2013 and into 2014, we're going to continue to see a nice volume improvements in Brazil.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And just one more on the food can contract, can you go into any more detail about what happened with that contract? Obviously, you said you're not going to lose it before 2015, but any additional insight into that situation?
Scott C. Morrison: Other than we're talking a couple of years out into the future, when you have something like that, usually it comes under price, is my guess. So price plays a big part of it. But nothing more to offer. We -- I think we know how to -- we've got other things in the pipeline from a new product perspective, and we'll manage our footprint as necessary. And we've done this before in other businesses, so we know how to do it. So we're just letting people know.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about how much of that double-digit drop in 12-ounce North American bev you've been able to offset with specialty cans?
Scott C. Morrison: Quite a bit. I mean, if you look at the profitability, you can't see the profitability [ph] of North America, but they've done a heck of a job of both -- of taking out costs, growing specialty can. I mean, even some of the business, some of the same customers that we reduced 12-ounce volume with, we're growing specialty business. So it's been a great offset to that business to offset the declines in 12-ounce.
John A. Hayes: Yes. I would just add that from a volume perspective, we grew mid-teens in the specialty size. It's all obviously off a smaller base, but then -- so our overall volumes are down. But the double-digit improvement of specialty, it now represents 22%, 23% of our overall mix. Now part of it has to do with lower 12-ounce, obviously, but the other part has to do with increasing specialty. And it's -- we've been very focused on that. There's a variety of new products coming out this year related to that, and we continue to focus on that segment.
Scott C. Morrison: I think that and managing the cost base aggressively, has really done a great job.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. And am I correct that the kind of the throughput, just the unit throughput, on specialty cans tends to be a bit lower than on the 12-ounce?
Scott C. Morrison: That is correct.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And are you likely, given this growth in specialty, are you likely to have to make any more capacity changes over the next 12 months as you see it right now?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think in the growth capital that Scott has mentioned and anticipated in that is some of these changes. And it's not adding new capacity, it's converting 12-ounce capacity to other sizes and capabilities.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then could you also just address kind of the timing on pure repurchase activity? The stock's down about 4.5% today. I wondered whether you're likely to do kind of more at a point like this, or whether you'll wait till the second half of the year when your cash flow tends to be stronger?
Scott C. Morrison: No. I think it sounds like it's on sale today. So it sounds probably a good day to buy. We've got to get out of a blackout period. But we're still on track to use most of our free cash flow to buy back our stock, and we'll anticipate we'll get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie Group.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Just a question on Europe on the higher labor cost you cited. Is that a big sequential step-up that you saw fourth quarter to one quarter that helped catch you by surprise?
John A. Hayes: I think the costs were -- kind of came into the business in the second half of last year. This move to Zurich is more than just a move of headquarters. So we went to what's called a principle structure, where the plants essentially instead of become -- being kind of their own of profit and loss center, become a tolling manufacturing operation and a distributing operation. And I think we've got some added people cost because of that. So it added complexity to the business. And I think we added people because of that, and now we're going through a process. I've been over to Europe twice in the past couple of weeks as we look into how do we streamline some of those processes and make it more efficient.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay, all right. And along those lines, I know you mentioned higher metal premiums in Europe. But I think I understand there was some opportunity in some contracts for higher prices. So can you just talk about -- are you saying that you didn't get enough pricing to offset all of the increase in metal premiums? Or was there any extra pricing in this year in Europe has [ph] ?
Scott C. Morrison: No, I think that's fair. I mean, we didn't get enough price to offset some of the cost structures. There's also -- energy costs are up dramatically in Europe. Tax, they're raising energy taxes dramatically in places like Germany and France, and so those kinds of things are impacting you, too.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. Now on the energy, it's a little bit surprising to me on the energy front, just given historically, there's not a lot of energy usage for a can plant. And traditionally, we haven't seen a big sensitivity to energy prices in terms of your earnings. So is there anything unusual going on this year in terms of that? And is there opportunity on your contract structures, is that a year lag? Or what's the structural like to pass some of that through?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I mean, there's a fair amount of energy use -- electricity used in making -- in a can plant, if you walk through a can plant. Typically, the energy prices don't change as dramatically, but energy prices in Germany, for instance, they've raised. They're moving away from all their nuclear plants, they're going to renewable energy, which is a good green thing to do, but it's going to drive the costs much higher. And so we're seeing the impact of that. In terms of -- I'm trying to remember the second part of your question...
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: The structure for pass-through right now -- yes, because some of them have pass-throughs for that kind of stuff. I think it might be a year lag, but...
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, there are lags, and it would depend on the contract again. But there is a lag, so you know you're going to feel the pain for a period of time until you get to reopen those contracts.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay, all right. And then follow-up just on aerospace, I mean, I know it's lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So in this quarter, you were, I think, $18 million or so of EBIT, and I know it's lumpy. So is that just kind of unusual versus the recent sort of experience we saw last year? Or how should we be thinking about the run rate of the aerospace business?
John A. Hayes: Remember, last year, we had a number of close out of contracts, and the lumpiness has to do with when you're starting up new contracts, usually the profitability is a bit lower on the front end of it relative to back end, just because the risk's higher. And as you execute on those contracts and reduce the risk, the profitability goes up. And so we had a number of close outs in 2012, and we have a number of ramp ups, which is good for the long term in 2013. That's the vast majority, if not all of, exactly what we are talking about.
Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay, so we should -- so should we expect then as we get to the back half of this year that, that starts to tick back up as these projects move forward in time? Or is this kind of a good run rate for the rest of the year?
John A. Hayes: It's probably closer to a good run rate for the rest of the year. And remember, these contracts often are 3, 4, 5 year contracts. And so when you're sitting, we -- as I said, we had a -- you look at our margins last year, they were record high margins. And they were -- because there are so many close outs, and I think we're having so many startups here. And so the fundamentals of that business are quite good. But really, where that profitability will really, assuming we're executing, really starts to fall in 2014 and '15.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of housekeeping or miscellaneous questions. But first, let me start with aerospace. If I heard earlier, and to follow-up on Al's question, if I heard earlier, I thought you said for the balance for the year with the exception of Europe, that would be down on a year-over-year basis in North America or Americas bev where you intended to be flat, but you'd indicate all the businesses would likely be up for the year. So kind of marry that with your previous comments as we think of the run rate for the balance of the year, should we still be thinking about aerospace year-over-year being up or being flat or being modestly lower?
John A. Hayes: No, I don't think it's up. Remember, in January what I said is, there's not upside relative to aerospace. And so if we miscommunicated that, apologies there. I think -- I'm sorry?
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: No problem. That was in earlier comments, I might have picked it up incorrectly. Second question I had was with respect to, as we look at some of the specialty can and trying to delineate between what we're seeing in sort of your 12-ounce business versus your specialty business, were all pieces up or down in Europe? In North America, obviously, we knew you lost a lot of regular business. But when we're looking around different regions, how should we think about which pieces are doing well, which pieces aren't, specifically trying to weigh [ph] some of that?
John A. Hayes: Well, in Europe, as I said, with -- we had mix issues related to -- we had lower specialty sales relative to standard sales. And a lot of it had to do with we're selling less beer, which is $0.50 a liter and selling relatively more CSD, which is $0.33 a liter. I think that's the biggest change in Europe.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one other question with respect to Europe is, what's your mix as it sits today, steel versus aluminum?
John A. Hayes: Well, as this is public knowledge, but we're in the process of converting one of our German plants from steel to aluminum. And that's in some of the CapEx that Scott had mentioned, and that should be largely completed within the next month or so. And so pro forma that after we go through that, it's less than 1/3 steel and then the balance of it, aluminum.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Last question was, was the -- your anticipation as the year rolls on with some of the beer customers in Europe, is it that -- I know you talked about some of the promotional activity that could help buoy things a bit, but is it your anticipation that, that business will get a little bit better absent many cost-cutting pieces, number one. And then number two, do you worry about other capacity adjustments over there? I recognize you are going to do some work, structurally, more on back-office headquarters that, type of stuff, but do you feel you would want any other capacity realignment or adjustments over there as well?
John A. Hayes: No, we don't see any capacity realignments in Europe at this time. The market fundamentally is still growing. We're just coming off of one quarter, a seasonally slow quarter that had bad weather and was soft. And so as we go into the year, you have to assume that weather will be normalized in there, and we expect volumes to come back. And we have said this in the prior couple of conference calls that we don't have any plans on adding capacity until we get our cost structure right there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the food can contract that is going to be lost in 2015. Is that going to go to -- is that a new entrant in the marketplace or another player that's not the other 2 big players that we know in the market?
John A. Hayes: It's a -- we're not 100% sure. So anything we'd say is speculating, so it could be either one of what you're saying. And we believe it could be a new entrant, but we're not 100% sure.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, John. And then on the specialty can side here in the U.S., you talked about your mix being 22% to 23% of your can production in the U.S. is specialty. Do you have an estimate of what that number is for the market?
John A. Hayes: Much less, much less. We'd lead the market relative to specialty container. So I don't know the number off the top of my head, but I'm going to guess it's probably half that.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And then how much more room do you see on your end to continue to improve the mix towards specialty? I mean, is there an upper bound that you see?
John A. Hayes: Well, yes, there is always an upper bound and one of the reasons why we improved is because we had less 12-ounce, as you know. We've been over the past number of years spending a lot of time on looking at new customers and new markets. The craft beer market is a good one with -- that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Yes, it's a 12-ounce container, but it's a non-standard 12-ounce container that we'll be rolling out with that one customer. So there's a variety of opportunities there. You think about even on the CSD side and several years ago, there were none of these 7.5-ounce cans. And now they have really started to taken off, and even some of our big customers have publicly talked about double-digit growth there and their focus on it. So I think there's just a lot of opportunity in mainstream and in some of the more-unique categories where, historically, cans did not play a part of.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Interesting. My last question is on Brazil. Can you talk about how your customer base down there is beginning to prepare for the World Cup next year? And whether there's any preliminary implications of what that would mean for demand of the metal can relative to the glass bottle?
John A. Hayes: Yes, what I can tell you is there is a variety of beer customers. Virtually every beer company down there, a major one that we're aware of, are putting significant capital dollars towards canned filling. And we pay a very close attention to that. and I'm sure other people in the industry do. And so there's a good sense that there's going to be a focus on cans as we go into the World Cup.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a follow-up on specialties. Granted volumes have been strong. When you look at the supply-demand balance in North America, given some of your competitors are adding specialty capacity as well and experiencing some of the same pressures in 12-ounce, is the margin premium or the return premium you get from specialties over commodity cans, has it been a fairly stable over the last year or is it, in some cases, expanding or contracting? Or is there any way that you can help us think about that?
John A. Hayes: No, it's reasonably stable. And it's important to point out though, when we talk about specialty, it's not just one specialty size. We make everything from 5.8-ounce all the way up to 32-ounce, and we make approximately 20 different sizes. And so when you think about from a manufacturing perspective, when someone's putting in new specialty capacity, they may be putting in one particular size, and that has no effect on other sizes. So you just need to be conscious of that fact. But as, I think, we go forward, we are seeing a proliferation of sizes which creates complexity. And I think as a result of that, the supply and demand balance of that is relatively healthy right now.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to North American beverage, is there any way that you can quantify the impact of the Gainesville shutdown? Or to -- what percentage of that capacity is going to be filled out of other existing facilities? Or is there any kind of way that you can quantify that?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, we moved some of that equipment into existing end facilities in North America. So we still needed to produce a decent number of those adds. So some of it is being redeployed in North America, and some of it is available to be deployed in other places.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The majority of that capacity will be redeployed elsewhere?
John A. Hayes: Majority? About half.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes.
John A. Hayes: Yes, about half will be redeployed into existing facilities here in the U.S. which is actually already done. Remember, Gainesville is winding down right now. It's a very small staff and crew right now because the equipment has already been moved out and moved into other places here in North America. And the remaining equipment, as what Scott was saying, can be redeployed into other growth areas outside the United States.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I want to come back to the food can issue. And I think I know a little bit of what's behind it. But still food can contracts moving from one supplier to another on price in a market where there is no growth, smacks of the 1990s, and not in a good way. And so I recognize every year, there's probably a little bit of movement here and there, but do you sense that the food can market is taking a different turn in terms of competition from price standpoint than what we've seen here the last 10 years? And then the related question, I know it's early, could we assume that when that volume moves, that you'll be able to utilize the facilities to produce any number of products that you're making these days, that you weren't maybe making, say, 10, 15 years ago?
John A. Hayes: Yes. George, the first answer is no. We believe this to be an isolated event. Secondly, with our facilities, many of our facilities' tin plate, we have co-manufactured aerosol containers as well as food containers there. And Scott mentioned, we have some opportunities. We have some new technologies and new products that are coming down the pipe that we're going -- we are exploring. We haven't made any decision on that. And certainly in a fixed-cost business, a great way of leveraging your fixed cost is putting it into existing facilities.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And the last question, to the extent that you can comment, this new contract that you have in craft beer, is it a shaped can in any way? And is there any way to size the volume that's fully running?
John A. Hayes: Yes, it is. The can is a 12-ounce. It has a unique size on the end, which is different, and it will be in market shortly. I know there's pictures out there on the Internet. In terms of the growth opportunity, candidly, it's too early to tell. This is a new product that's getting out to the market. As you know, we have seen a lot of strong growth in the craft beer market. And when you go with a company the size of this one, starts to put their weight behind it, we just don't know what the opportunity is, but we think it's real important. If nothing else, because it's yet another further validation of the can has a place to play in a different market than it historically had.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Last time I seem to recall that you -- not last quarter, but just in the past, that when you buttoned-up some of your joint ventures in China that your share there was north of 30%. And we've been hearing about very strong growth in China. My question is, how much do you think the supply still exceeds the demand in the marketplace? In other words, what are operating rates? And if we continue to see recent growth rates, when do you think we get to a tighter condition there?
John A. Hayes: Yes. We talked about this on the first quarter call, I remember. And we said overcapacity and our estimation is in the range of 20% to 25%, and the overall market has been growing 10% to 15%. So it's probably about 2 years or so, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more, depending on the growth of the market. We just had another quarter of reasonably strong growth in the industry, and which is generally consistent with what I talked about there. And so I don't think anything that we talked about on the first quarter has fundamentally changed.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Now, how about in terms of some of the smaller players? And maybe you can't be terribly specific, but do you sense that there is more a consolidation opportunity? Or do you think these guys are just going to wait it out?
John A. Hayes: I probably can't comment on that. But what I would tell you is, anytime there's overcapacity in a strong growth market, people -- the reason why there's overcapacity is people are investing ahead and then they realize that wasn't such a good idea. And if you're financially strong, you can probably weather it. If you're not financially strong, you probably have to think about alternatives.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the CapEx for the $400 million this year, how much of that is spoken for? Because I believe maintenance is like $200 million to $220 million, and then you have some carryover from last year. So -- I mean, how much wiggle room do you really have on that number?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, things can always slide to the right. I mean, if you recall last year, where we started CapEx estimation and then it came down through the year because a lot of things kind of slid to the right. And that's -- there's usually not much that gets canceled, it's probably more that gets shifted. And so it just slows -- we slow down the pace of it.
John A. Hayes: Yes, I would say, all things equal, relative to last year though, a little bit more of it is committed because it was the carryover from last year.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, so we had a lot of things that -- we've announced the Alagoinhas line in January. So much of that capital will get spent this year as it comes up and running in hopefully by the end of the third quarter. Like some of the specialty things that we've done in the U.S., those things are going to happen. So it's probably less potential to have huge shifts in that capital, I would agree with that.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So as we think about the number last year around $300 million, as we look forward beyond this year and kind of ignore the carryover impacts, is that realistically kind of the real floor for how low CapEx would go?
Scott C. Morrison: No, it really is dependent on the opportunities. I mean, every one is a discrete decision that is determined by the customer contract . We talked about Europe, we need to do some things in Europe on the cost side before we commit to expanding capacity there. We're still seeing decent growth in markets like Brazil, and North American specialty, and even China continues to grow well while we're not adding any capacity, we get pricing better there. So we're still seeing growth opportunities, but I wouldn't say it's necessarily a floor or a ceiling, because it depends on the opportunities that are there.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then my other question on free cash flow is, this is the third straight year we're seeing guidance for significant working capital benefits. So is this -- at what point do we reach saturation on those opportunities versus -- is this still like a multiyear opportunity for you?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, we're not done yet. So I would say we're still expecting some benefits in '13, and then we'll see -- a lot of the guys kind of across the businesses and treasury and a lot of different sourcing, and then the businesses have been very creative as to how we go after this. And we're -- it's kind of like an ongoing treadmill, you're never really done.
John A. Hayes: Yes. As you know, we're evangelical on EVA dollars. And historically, we have focused on EBIT and CapEx. And what Scott is really talking about is we see opportunities on the working capital line, and we're going after them.
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: One last one, and piggybacking on Chip's question earlier and your comments as well early in the presentation. Perhaps you mentioned it, but how do we reconcile you using an ability perhaps to optimize your customer mix? That's my phrasing, not yours, but paraphrasing, in China with an intent towards perhaps repricing when you still have, from your vantage point, excess capacity in the market?
John A. Hayes: Well, it's -- I'm talking only on behalf of Ball, and we're sold out. And so if things get tight and customers need more cans, we're going to be looking at where it makes sense for Ball to be selling those cans that are scarce to us.
Operator: Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at the time.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Well, thank you very much, Daisy, and thank you, everyone. I just have one reminder that we're going to be hosting an Investor Day and a management briefing in Midtown Manhattan on October 2 and 3. Analysts and institutional investors should contact Ann Scott for an invitation. And thank you for participating on today's call, and we look forward to talking to you in 3 months time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 31, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.
John A. Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, France. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will recall that in November, the company announced Ray Seabrook, our Chief Operating Officer of Global Packaging, would retire at the end of 2012. Ray had a very long and very successful career at Ball, and we wish him all the best going forward. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance and then, Scott will discuss financial and Global Packaging metrics. We'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2013. Ball reported very good 2012 results in a challenging economic environment. This performance is a tribute to our employees and their dedication to controlling our own future and embracing our Drive for 10 vision. Drive for 10 progress in 2012 included: Maximizing value on our North American packaging, the beverage container business, by increasing our manufacturing flexibility through the expansion of specialty can production and reduction of standard 12-ounce capacity; broadening our geographic reach and growing with the right customers in markets in Brazil by installing a second line capable of making multiple sizes in our new Alagoinhas facility. The line will service multiple customers under long-term contracts and will be operational in the second half of 2013. We also completed the startup of our new facilities in Qingdao, China, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We completed our new aerospace clean room facility expansion in Colorado, which leverages our technology expertise and will help service more than $1 billion of contracted backlog. And we completed the acquisition in mid-December of an extruded aluminum manufacturing facility in Mexico, which broadens our geographic reach and brings new capabilities to our global metal food and household segment. 2012 was a busy yet rewarding year. Our disciplined market leadership, focus on profitable growth and system upgrades in our existing businesses has strengthened Ball for the long term. Yesterday, in recognition of the company's strong performance, our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase in the dividend. That action is aligned with our focus of returning value to our shareholders. We do face some headwinds going into 2013, like we do in most years, but at this time, I'm comfortable that we have the right mix of experience and conviction to ensure another successful year going forward. Before I talk about aerospace and what we see going into 2013, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our 2012 numbers. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2012 were $3.06 versus last year's $2.73, an increase of 12%. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.64 versus last year's $0.48, a 33% increase. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $38 million related mainly to the previously announced closeout of a Canadian pension plan and costs associated with plant closures and a voluntary separation program tied to optimal staffing in our North American businesses and shared services. For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: Global metal beverage packaging volume growth of 3%; higher comparable operating earnings; solid program performance in our aerospace business; lower corporate undistributed costs and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted full year 2012 earnings per share by $0.09, and in the fourth quarter, by $0.01. Turning to free cash flow, Ball generated $548 million in 2012. Again, we returned every free cash flow dollar to shareholders via a net share buyback program of $494 million and dividends of $62 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3.1 billion, only $153 million increase over 2011 despite our acquisitions in Mexico and [indiscernible], and acquiring nearly $500 million of stock. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remain solid, with the 2012 comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 5x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.7x. Committed credit and available liquidity at the end of the year was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of the fourth quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Recapping segment performance. Metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were up both in the quarter and full year due to slightly better volumes in North America for both the quarter and full year, as well as mix shifting to specialty cans. Our specialty cans volume grew nearly 25% in 2012. Volumes in Brazil were up over 30% in the quarter and 20% in 2012. China volumes were down mid-single digits in the quarter on difficult comps and up 11% for the year. European segment profit declined both in the quarter and full year due mainly to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Beverage can volumes in the quarter were down low-single digits and full year volumes up mid-single digits. Extruded aluminum aerosol volumes grew over 10% in the quarter and full year. In food and household, segment earnings were up nicely in the quarter and almost flat on a full year basis. Segment volumes were down approximately 2% in the quarter and nearly 7% for the full year. Truly excellent performance given 2012's difficult harvest and lack of inventory holding gains last year. Finally, a few financial metrics and housekeeping items for 2013. Full year interest expense, retirement benefit costs and the effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be roughly flat with 2012. Given $100-million-plus of carry-in capital, full year 2013 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Therefore, we expect 2013 free cash flow to be in the range of $450 million. We will continue to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown in 2013. Effective in 2013, Ball will close its quarters on a calendar month basis. This means the first quarter of 2013 will have 2 fewer days, and as we alluded to in our management succession release in November, the global metal food and household segment will also include the results of our European extruded aluminum packaging business, as well as the recently acquired facility in Mexico. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well, with solid execution on existing programs and contracted backlog still above $1 billion. Being cost competitive has allowed Ball to win our fair share of government, aerospace and defense projects. Despite the ongoing lingering ambiguity about the U.S. government's finances and the threat of defense cuts, we remain bullish on this segment. As we transition to 2013 and looking out across the operations today, keeping in mind it is only January, a few observations to share. First, we expect the Americas, Asia segment earnings to be relatively flat in 2013. Due to the overcapacity situation that exists in China, we face pricing pressures there. And as you know, the loss of 12-ounce business in North America creates a trough from which to build. However, current specialty can demand trends in Brazil and North America have warranted additional capital investments and provide good growth opportunities in 2013 and beyond. In Europe, given lackluster economic conditions, we do not anticipate any near-term capital investments for beverage can's expansion. Instead, we have a strong focus on cost optimization initiatives across the region. Our global food and household product segment is busy integrating our new plant in Mexico, investing capital to meet the increased demand for aluminum aerosol containers. And we anticipate a more normal seasonal vegetable harvest here in the United States. In our aerospace business, while uncertainty still remains around the U.S. government plans on sequestration, Ball's strong track record should keep us well positioned for the long term, although depending on the outcome of sequestration, it could be a bit more lumpy than usual. All across Ball, we have a management team that understands how to generate incremental EVA dollars. Our company's cash flow is strong, and we are actively managing our businesses to align assets and cost structures to respond to dynamic market -- global markets. All in all, 2013 will be a year where we have many levers to improve our financial results, and more importantly, sets us up even better for 2014 and beyond. We have our hands on what we need to do to execute upon, and barring further deterioration in global markets or economic conditions, we continue to strive to reach our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal. And with that, France, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You referenced the pricing pressure in Asia, and I'm just wondering, is that -- did that pressure accelerate over the 3 months of the quarter? And then as we've moved into January, have you seen it -- have you seen that pressure abate or how is the beginning of the year?
John A. Hayes: Well, as we said, I think on the third quarter, that we anticipated pricing pressures in China, and that's exactly what's happened. The negotiation season was the fourth quarter and we did see pricing pressure there. Most of those negotiations are over now, and so as we go into '13, it's about execution.
Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And a couple of years ago, I think you disclosed that your market share in China was 31%. And I'm wondering given that you've been a little bit more disciplined regarding capacity than some of your competitors and maybe have walked away from some business, has your market share meaningfully changed from that 31%? Or can you provide any kind of quantification around that?
John A. Hayes: Well, I'll tell you, in 2012, we grew roughly in line with what the market grew. So our market share was relatively the same. We have delayed capital and have chosen not to add any significant capital in China going into '13, so we see our volume growth in '13 to be at or slightly below what the market is doing, so we could lose a little bit of market share. But what we're trying to do is make sure our business is as healthy as possible from a pricing perspective.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to go back to the Americas, Asia beverage can segment. As you look out to '13 now versus where you were, say, 3 months ago, has anything changed markedly? Would it be pricing in China or is the aggregate of profit performance and the complexion that drives that more or less as you anticipated back in September -- or October?
Scott C. Morrison: It really hasn't changed markedly, George. There's definitely some headwinds that we -- that John talked about, the pricing pressure, the loss of volume in North America. But our guys have done a great job responding to those issues and growth in specialty capacity, we're still seeing; growth in Brazil, we're still seeing. So it hasn't changed markedly. Some of the levers may have changed a little bit, but in general, we're still with the same kind of outlook.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Scott, considering that last quarter, you were talking about how, apparently anyway, good the growth in specialty can demand and opportunities was for you. And that seems like it's the case again this quarter. If I more or less hold that constant, maybe that's not the right assumption, it seems like the -- if there has been anything that's changed, it sounds like it's changed for the negative, it would be again the pricing in China. Would that be a fair statement?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I think that's a fair statement.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Now the -- in terms of guidance, in terms of striving for the long-term goal of 10% to 15%, does that suggest something more aspirational longer term? Or is that something you think is within your sights for 2013, remembering the company's old phrase, you'd rather be heroes in December than in January?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Well, I remember on the third quarter, I said that the -- our long-term range is 10% to 15%, and it's going to be quite challenging to get to the upper end of the range, but we're going to strive to get to the lower end of the range. And that's where we are right now. It is only January. Various things have to happen, but as we sit here right now, that we have some challenges on our hands, but we think that we can push -- if we push and are successful in many initiatives we have, we might be able to get to that 10% -- to the lower end of the 10% to 15% in earnings per share growth.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Last question, I'll turn it over. Can you provide a bit more color, commentary on the consolidation activities that you have ongoing in metal packaging in the Americas? You obviously have some charges in the fourth quarter in beverage, which have been well discussed and telegraphed, but also in food, you have some things going on. Is that mostly the integration of Mexico? What else is in there?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, on the beverage side, everything is on schedule. We closed the Columbus facility at the end of the year, Gainesville will close in the first half of this year. All of that's on track to what we expected. On the food side, that was the closeout of a Canadian pension plan, so where we had annuitized it. And we talked about that in the third quarter call. And then we're really excited about the acquisition that we made down in Mexico and the opportunities there going forward in 2013.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Buckingham Research (sic) [Barclays].
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Still at Barclays. On the Asia business, can you just sort of parse that for us? I know you've got a large position in China, but what are the other regions there? And what are you seeing as far as price pressure outside of China?
John A. Hayes: Well, the only other places we really operate outside of China is our joint venture in Vietnam and we have a small interest in Thailand. I think generally speaking, we are seeing some pricing pressures, but it's not terrible. But I -- if I commented on any other region, I don't think it'd be fair because we don't sell into those regions.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then are you seeing any bifurcation between alcoholic versus non-alcoholic cans? Is that anything that you're seeing in the market? And then also, just the impact of the Chinese New Year, how much is that impacting the -- both the fourth quarter and the first quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think your question is from a volume perspective, and you're right, the Chinese New Year is a bit later this year. And so as we sit here towards the end of January, we've seen some reasonably strong growth in the month of January in our business over in China. And I think it has to do with the Chinese New Year. It's been extremely cold in China, and so I know beer has been soft. I think the overall market was a bit soft in the fourth quarter. But I think it's more weather-related. If you followed the weather, Northern China in particular was extremely cold and extremely snowy. And so that had some impact in the fourth quarter.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on North American specialty can mix, where do we end the year on mix of specialty as far as the total can mix in North America? And what's the outlook for 2013 as you bring more specialty cans into the mix?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think our percent was in the 17%, 18% range for 2012. And as we look to 2013, we have some exciting things going on, on our specialty business, so we expect to see some continued growth in that. Whether it's on the smaller sizes, 7.5-ounce, whether it's on the sleek, which is a 12-ounce but a different shaped container, or on some of the larger sizes, we see good growth there. And I think part of it has to do with new housing starts are beginning, and that's good middle-class jobs that are the big consumers of those types of packages, as well as unemployment in the 21- to 34-year-old range, year-over-year went from over 9% to about 7.7%, 7.8%. So we've seen a pickup in the core beer consumer as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: It's Matt Wooten sitting in for Ghansham today. I was hoping that -- on a longer term basis, what do you anticipate as a sustainable number for growth CapEx? As I recall, maintenance CapEx is about $200 million a year.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, that's a good number to use for maintenance CapEx. Growth CapEx depends on the opportunities that are there. We really look to deploy capital wherever we think we can make attractive returns, and how fast that comes changes over time. If you look back, last year our capital spend declined throughout the year, that's why we had so much pushed into 2013. And so we're always adjusting our capital plans based on what the world looks like. So it's hard to predict long term, 3, 4 years from now, what that might look like because it really depends on global growth.
Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then from your customer base, 2012 seemed like a year that was a little light in terms of promotional activity. Have you received any indications that promotional activity will pick up in 2013, either from soda producers or beer producers?
John A. Hayes: I think it's too early for them to have a strong view of what they're going to be doing in the summer of 2013. That's probably better asked at the end of the first quarter just because it's January and they still have 4 to 6 months to when their big selling season really begins.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. First, if we could talk a little bit about where you feel your utilization rates are in beverage. If you were to kind of walk around the globe and talk about China, Vietnam, Brazil, Europe, North America, et cetera, I know you talked about maybe seeing a little bit of growth in some of those regions, but you're not putting a lot of capacity in. So just trying to get a sense of where your utilization rates are.
John A. Hayes: Yes, you often hear us talk about trying to make sure that our supply matches our demand, and that's exactly what we do. In North America, I think we even said this on the third quarter, in 2013, we're real tight with the closure of the Columbus facility. And so I think we're -- our utilization rates are, are very high there. In China, they also are very high, and that's the reason why I said in 2013, while the market's probably going to grow a little bit stronger than we are because where the pricing is, we want to make sure the pricing is right relative to the cans that we sell. And so we do have a little bit of line speedups here and there that's part of that carry-in capital Scott was mentioning. But nothing significant and we're keeping a very close eye because there is a fair amount of overcapacity from an industry perspective, but you don't see it in the Ball system. Brazil, obviously, we're adding a new line there, and so we're running full out there. And then in Europe, I said on the third quarter that longer term, we would expect to look at some capacity there. But in the short term, we're focusing on costs, and that's exactly where we are going into 2013. The market grew mid-single digits in 2012. We expect about the same in 2013. That's going to make us very tight in Europe as well.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And I guess my follow-up with this is, you're going to be spending -- [indiscernible] the math question -- you're going to be spending about $200 million in return-oriented, growth-oriented capital this year. Can you maybe -- I know it's going to be a long list of projects, but could you kind of bucket maybe a few categories or maybe by segments where a lot of that capital is going? Is most of it targeted to beverage? Is most of it targeted to speedups or is it aerosol capacity or other different pieces like that?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, it's where the growth is, Chris. It is specialty cans in North America and in Brazil -- John mentioned an additional line down in Brazil. We're finishing up some things from last year, some speedups that we were doing in different places. We're seeing nice growth in aluminum aerosol. We think there's opportunities with the Mexico acquisition, to add capacity there. So it's in a variety of places.
John A. Hayes: Yes, the only thing I'd add on to that, in North America, we are adding specialty capability in some of our standout -- standard 12-ounce facilities, and that's one of the reasons why that carry-in capital's large, but most -- actually all that volume is contracted already. And so it's good return projects.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question, just getting to the guidance around Americas, Asia being flat for this year. Could you give us a sense, just between North America, China, Brazil, how to think about that? I mean, is it fair to say North America down, China flat, Brazil up? Or just give us a rough sense of how you're thinking about it.
John A. Hayes: We normally don't break that out, but I think your intuition is generally correct.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And the reason I'm driving at this question is it kind of comes back towards this long-term guidance goal of the 10% to 15%. Clearly, there's some transitional elements to 2013 related to the business lost in North America. So I'm just trying to get a sense of hypothetically, if we have 8% EPS growth this year. There's a certain element to that, that should come back just as we lap that. I'm trying to just kind of calibrate how to think about that.
John A. Hayes: Maybe from a contextual perspective, we can help create some sort of bridge here. We talked about Americas and Asia being relatively flat. Europe, depending on what happens there, there ought to be a little bit of upside in Europe. But obviously, with the economic conditions there, it's premature to bank on that. Our food and household products business ought to be up. We had a very difficult 2012, and our folks performed very well there. How much up is a question of what the harvest looks like. And then we have the new Mexican facility, the impact extruded business that contributes to that. And the European impact extruded business, we continue to do reasonably well there. And then on the aerospace, we don't expect much upside at all in that business, particularly in light of the uncertainty around sequestration. And then the corporate, I don't -- Scott said it was going to be relatively flat. So that provides coordinate income of up in the low single-digit range. And through the use of our cash flow, it gets up to the -- that's where we think we have a shot towards the lower end of our long-term goals.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got you. Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on China, I mean, you did make the comment, I believe, Ray did on the last call, that volume would be up, and you'd be kind of clawing back to negative price in 2013. So I mean, do you think China, specifically, will grow earnings this year? Or how do you think about that?
John A. Hayes: I think it's going to be challenging, too. As we said, we've retarded any meaningful growth cap on that area, and so we expect our volumes to be at or slightly below what the market's going to be doing. And I think given the pricing challenges, it is going to be a bit difficult. Now having said that, let's put this in context. There's overcapacity of 20% to 25% in Asia. It is growing in the mid-teens. And so that's 18, maybe 24 months of excess capacity. And so as we're looking into 2014, it's about getting our pricing in a position as we go into 2014 where we have a lot of operational leverage.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. I guess the last question is just around the volume growth outlook for China. I think at some point this year, the growth rate had been slowing to something below mid-teens. So could you give us a sense of where that reacceleration may be occurring, what end markets specifically?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I do think it's across most of the end markets in China. I think the slowdown was largely weather-related. As I mentioned, it was extremely cold. But we have a pretty good handle on where can filling capacity is going in on the beer side, on the CSD side, on the tea side, on the energy side. And as a result of that, we continue to see the overall market being -- growing in the double-digit range.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Co.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Europe, at least actually on a bev can side, actually grew at a mid-single-digit rate, which is pretty healthy. But your comments for 2013 sound like you're generally a little more cautious. So you're expecting a little slower growth on the bev can side with tougher comps or just the macro?
John A. Hayes: No, not particularly. I think you're parsing our words a little bit more than we intended. We -- as we said, we grew mid-single digits for the year in that. Now remember, it was an even-numbered year, and so there are some special summer things going on in terms of European Cup, the Olympics, that we're not going to have in 2013. But where we see the -- we still see low- to mid-single-digit growth in the European market.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So from a pricing standpoint, things were -- you've seen some erosion, but sounds like the market's tightened up a bit. So how should we be thinking about pricing in Europe for 2013?
Scott C. Morrison: I don't think -- I think we've hit the trough. We talked about price, some of the price pressure, but that's why we're focused on internally on things we can control on the cost side and not adding capacity until we get the price equation a little bit better.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. But you guys haven't settled out your contracts on pricing, because I thought you guys typically settled out year end of 2012.
John A. Hayes: Yes, we've largely settled out, and what I would say is relative to 3 months ago when we were on the call, the pricing environment is a touch more healthy in Europe than it was.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I know it's early in the year, but you guys were commenting on the pack, you're expecting a more normalized pack. What about demand for aerosol?
John A. Hayes: Go ahead, Scott.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, demand for aluminum aerosol is very strong. For tinplate aerosol last year, it was -- kind of bounced around. The fourth [ph] quarter [ph] was very good. But overall, we feel pretty good about the aerosol business.
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think long term, the steel, the tinplate aerosol business here in North America at least, is probably 0% to 2% growth type of market, GDP type growth, and we don't expect any meaningful changes in that.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the steel tinplate side, anything to think about for 2013 with holding gains and all that stuff?
Scott C. Morrison: No, it should be relatively flat. There's not much going around on either way.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Are there any regulatory developments that particularly concern you, for instance, the potential for minimum pricing in Britain, the tax increase on beer in France or otherwise?
John A. Hayes: We're always facing regulatory issues and not only in -- for Ball Corporation, but I think business at large. I think on a global scale, regulation is only increasing, not decreasing. And so as we sit there, the things that you mentioned, those things don't concern us of anything in materiality -- from a materiality point of view. And so I would say, based on the things that you mentioned, no.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just, John, the acquisition pipeline. How would you compare it to what it's looked like in previous quarters? And what areas might you be looking at most closely?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I don't think it's all that different than over the past, certainly past 6, 12 months. We continue to see opportunities in metal packaging, whether it's on the aluminum impact extruded business, the beverage can business. Just think last year, we did something in the beverage can business, we did something in the aluminum impact extruded business as well. And I think those types of things, whether they're small or a bit larger are still out there, and we keep our nose to the grindstone in making sure that we have a good understanding of what's going on and what, well, candidly, we're willing to pay for some of those assets.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question has to do with the specialty can business, which obviously is really carrying the day in terms of growth in North America. And yet, it seems like from just what I've heard that in Europe, the specialty can business where it's been more of a presence for a longer period of time doesn't really share the same margin and growth spreads to standard cans like we see here. And so I just want to know if that's what you all see. And secondly, do you see a time where the specialty segment here in North America might slow down or we might see some margin compression versus the 12-ounce?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think in Europe, you are right, it's been around longer, but we still had good growth in 2012. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but I know at the end of the third quarter, it was around 8% or so. So it's above the market growth and certainly not what we've seen in North America. I do think that when you have line changeovers and other things, that it adds a bit of complexity into the system. And we need to get paid for that complexity. And so I don't think that necessarily changes. To your point, North America around the slowdown of specialty growth, yes, it's obviously, at some point in time, the base gets bigger and the growth slows down. But many of the fast-moving consumer goods companies, whether it's on the beer side, whether it's on the CSD side or even some other categories, energy, those types of things, they're continuing to look for ways to add value into the products that they sell. And they're finding good value in terms of the specialty cans that we produce, and that's why we've been seeing the growth.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And then sort of as a follow-on, sort of looking beyond the very near term in China -- that's sort of been discussed quite a bit already. But if we go back to, say, 15 months ago when we were out in Colorado and we were talking about the long-term for Ball and for the business, one thing that really struck -- jumped out was, at least to me, was how beer, only about 5% is -- was at that time in cans in China, whereas it was 38% in Brazil and I think over 50% here in North America. And it would seem -- do you think that there is a, if you will, a slower adoption rate than you thought? Or do you think -- do you continue to see a reason why you wouldn't see the can in beer adopted in China in increasing measure like we've seen in all these other places?
John A. Hayes: Yes, nothing fundamentally has changed there. It really gets into as new capacity is brought on are they putting bottle capacity or can capacity? And we see a fair amount of can capacity coming on. Remember, it's -- the China beer market is such a large market that I know even now, as we sit here a year ago -- a year later, it's up to 6%, 6.5%, which isn't a huge number percentage terms, but in terms of volume, that's where a lot of the growth is coming from. And so will it ever get to the 50% that we see in North America? That's a stretch, obviously. But I do think based on the conversations we have with our customers and seeing where they're putting their capital, that we expect to see over the long term, a continued increase in the penetrations of cans into the beer market.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then lastly, it's -- your CapEx number is a bit elevated for '13. Where do you think that would trend in '14 and '15? Let's say if you do get the kind of year you're planning for right now, and of course, we know things can change. But if it turns out to be net income up in the low single digits and EPS up close to 10%, do you think that CapEx number would likely rise? Or I mean, if -- still trail off or could it stay where it is or rise?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, we always think that it will get closer back towards depreciation because you don't have as good a visibility on some of the growth opportunities. So it's really dependent on how fast those growth opportunities materialize and how many there are. The world's slowing down, and frankly, if you asked us that same question last year, we thought it would come down this year. But we had so much carry-in capital that you really got to look at the 2 years in total versus just 1 year. So over time, we think it would come down a bit because when you're going through bigger growth spurts when we're building plants, that takes a lot more capital. When you could add new lines like we're doing in Alagoinhas, the incremental capital isn't as much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The planned cost reductions that you have for North America from the capacity closures, how do you see that flowing through the business through the year?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, we said the Columbus facility was closed at the end of the year, and the Gainesville facility is going to continue to operate for a little bit into this -- into 2013. So you'll start to get those benefits as we move later into the year.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And so some of the cost reduction is going to flow into '14?
Scott C. Morrison: No, the cost -- all this will be -- you're going to start seeing all the benefit here as we move into the year.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the pension, did you guys update us on where the pension plan ended up and what you see your pension expense contribution to be for '13?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we ended up funding quite a bit more than expense in '12, about $60 million more than expense in '12, just because the cash flow was so strong. In 2013, we think we'll fund about $20 million more in funding versus expense.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wondered if -- peer in a little bit more to the extent possible on the Americas profitability and the progression you expect there. If you consider the cost reductions that should help you this year and also the additional volume in specialty cans, is there a way to ballpark how much that might help you this year relative to the ultimate volume loss that you suffered going into 2013?
John A. Hayes: George, you're getting to a level of granularity that I wish we could be as specific as possible. But the reality is when you think about it, let's take a step back. For that segment going into 2013, we've closed the Columbus facility. As Scott just said, we expect to get the fixed cost benefits from that, that offset a lot of the variable margin that we had from the lost business. As we go into the second quarter and with the final closedown of Gainesville, we'll start to reap all of that. And then the second half the year, we're going to have the second line in Alagoinhas come up. And so when you think about all those things, I think we're going to have -- as the year goes on, we're going to have more momentum going into that segment, all things being equal.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Is it possible that within North America, if there's a way to parse that, that your EBIT might actually be flat considering the incremental margin from specialty and the cost reductions, which you said are more or less offsetting the variable margin on the volume loss? Or is that a heroic expectation at this juncture given where you sit?
John A. Hayes: Well, that's the trough that we're faced, and in my prepared remarks, that's why I said, well, it's a trough, but we're clawing out of it. And it's only January, George. So let's talk later in the year to see how specialty goes. But we have a reasonable shot, and that's what we said on the third quarter. And as Scott said, our outlook on that really hasn't changed materially.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Understand, guys. Just wanted to get a little bit more color -- or granularity, as you said. The last question I had is if we are having this conference call 3 years from now and we can project forward the aerosol business for Ball Corporation, do you see it being as meaningful a business as -- or it's not going to ever be as large as your beverage can business, but will we be talking with it -- about it in almost the same tone as a significant driver of your growth and future profitability? Is it that strategic to you and how do you see that evolving? Sorry for the broad question there, but I think it's an interesting element to your story longer term.
John A. Hayes: Yes, it's obviously from -- let's talk about from an overall market size perspective. It is significantly smaller than the 270-odd-billion beverage cans around the world. We're talking in the range of upper-single-digit billions of units. So obviously, it's not going to have that. But the business model is quite different because the capital and output ratios are quite different than the beverage can business. I would not expect 3 years from now to be talking it in the same size and tone of the beverage can business for Ball Corporation. But I will tell you this, we continue to have good growth opportunities. Some of that carry-in capital Scott was mentioning is in the impact extruded business. And so as that market continues to grow, we're going to be focused on it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Last one on this -- John, do you see that business broadly offering different types of metal packages than what it's doing right now, which is aluminum extruded aerosol cans? Are there opportunities to take that technology as it's used to some degree already in beverage into food applications and to other end markets? How would you have us consider that?
John A. Hayes: Well, I do think over the next several years, George, the greater opportunity is not so much in food, but probably beverage. Just think about what we've done with Alumi-Tek. It's been a year [ph] in North America and it's been quite successful. And we have a whole suite of bottles now, ranging from a DWI bottle, the Alumi-Tek all the way to the impact extruded and everything in between. Impact extruded is more relevant when you have smaller runs, and you have more differentiation, you can shape it. And the sizes of it, you can make a bit different than you can on something like the Alumi-Tek. But there are continued opportunities on the Alumi-Tek side as well. So does that answer your question?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, that was great. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is another follow-up from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to focus on the aerospace business, if I could for a second. As you look at the mix of business there, and I know you've told us this or disclosed this in the past and I just don't remember, the mix of business between, let's call it department -- or DOD or different elements in there, can you remind us of that?
John A. Hayes: Yes, more than 50% of it is in the DOD business. And when you partial that out, the preponderance of it are in the big, I would call it, strategic programs, satellites and things like that. And we do have a couple of other businesses in terms of the tactical products, antennas and other things for everything from the Joint Strike Fighter to other applications like that. And then we also have a services business that takes all that information and turns it into usable data. But like I said, 50% -- probably 50%, 60% of our aerospace business is directly DOD.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And as you think about full year 2013 versus 2012, and I appreciate there's some -- a little issue that might come up in midyear here that could impact things. How would you anticipate '13 might look versus '12? I mean you had some -- it looked some pretty good payments come in in 4Q that may or may not repeat next year. But could you maybe give us a sense of can it be a flat year for EBIT? Or do you think you could still have a little improvement? Or is it just too difficult to look at right now?
John A. Hayes: It really is really difficult to look at right out just because with the potential for sequestration out there. I will point out that at this time last year, our backlog was -- upper 800s, $890 million or so, and we're well over $1 billion right now. And so that just goes to show why we keep saying long term, we feel pretty good about this business. But as I said in my prepared remarks, because of the sequestration, it could be a bit more lumpy than we're used to. But we just don't have visibility into that yet.
Operator: We have another follow-up question from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on the working capital front. You guys have done a really solid job here for 2 years in a row, and I'm just curious, Scott, how you're planning for that in that guidance for 2013 free cash flow.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, really, all the guys have done a great job on the working capital front, whether it's managing inventories better, collecting receivables better, extending payable terms. It's been a really broad effort that a lot of people have been involved in and it's worked very well. We think there's still a little more to go on the working capital front in '13. We're still not where we think we need to be longer term, so we think there's still a little bit more upside in that. It should be a source in '13. How big I don't know.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay, okay. And then just on the pension, you said it's $20 million contribution in excess of the expense. Is that just for the U.S. plan or is that the total? Like what's the absolute dollar there?
Scott C. Morrison: That's total, that's total.
Operator: Mr. Hayes, we have no further questions at this time, sir. I'll be turning the call back to you.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Thank you, all, and thank you, all, for participating. And we look forward to what will hopefully be a challenging but productive 2013. And we'll talk to you all on the April call. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Have a great day, everyone.

Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO, Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow with details about our packaging, operating performance, and I will close with comments on aerospace and the outlook for the fourth quarter. Ball reported third quarter 2012 results ahead of last year's third quarter. Recall that we had mentioned in July that our second half 2012 results would be up year-over-year and, to date, we've performed slightly better than we expected. During the quarter, we made several -- we made progress on all of our Drive for 10 strategic levers. Several highlights include: In our North American beverage container business, we continue to aggressively manage our overall supply to meet market demand. We announced in August we are removing 12-ounce beverage can capacity from our system, converting additional 12-ounce capacity as specialty containers and redistributing can end-making equipment to existing Ball end centers. In addition, during the quarter, we initiated the voluntary separation program for salaried U.S. employees that will help rightsize our administrative expenses relative to our current business. In our beverage can businesses outside of North America, volumes improved nicely due to the startup of our Alagoinhas, Brazil; Qingdao, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam facilities. In fact, on a global basis, volumes were up nearly 7%. In our aerospace business, we continue to leverage our technological expertise as we align with growing markets, resulting in a record contracted backlog of $1.1 billion. We also announced our intentions to acquire an extruded aluminum manufacturing facility in Mexico and form a joint venture in Argentina with Envases del Plata, which broadens our geographic reach and brings new capabilities to our metal food and household business. And finally, during the quarter, we acquired the beverage can business of [indiscernible], a small regional beverage can manufacturer in Italy, for approximately $15 million. In the first year of operation, this investment will exceed our return hurdle. While world economies may have slowed a bit, our businesses are faring well as we continue to actively manage the business, and our pace of cost optimization and cash generation is accelerating. I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about our quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return to comment on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2012. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 were $0.90 versus last year's $0.81, an increase of 11%. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling $26.4 million related mainly to the relocation of our European headquarters and previously announced plant closures. The following factors contributed favorably to third quarter results: higher volumes in Europe, Brazil and China, as well as specialty can volume growth; solid program performance in our aerospace business and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted the third quarter by $0.03. For a complete summary of the third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes Section of today's earnings release. Recapping key financial metrics for 2012, full year corporate undistributed costs are expected to come in closer to $65 million. Interest expense will be around $177 million. The full year 2012 effective tax rate is projected to be around 28%, with the fourth quarter rate closer to 31%. Given recent global growth trends, full year 2012 CapEx is anticipated to run under $350 million. Therefore, we continue to expect 2012 free cash flow to be at least $0.5 billion. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be just over $3 billion, and we will return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown. Just as a heads up, in the fourth quarter, Ball will record a $38-million after-tax charge for the closeout of certain Canadian pension plans, costs associated with an employee voluntary separation program in the U.S., and additional cost associated with previously announced plant closures. With that I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Comparable third quarter operating results in the metal beverage, Americas and Asia segment were 18% above last year's level and through 9 months are up 6%. Third quarter Brazil performance was much improved from last year's level due largely to the contribution from or our new Alagoinhas plants, which came online in the second quarter, and strong year-over-year volume gains. In Asia, our new can plant in Vietnam is coming up to speed, and our plant in Qingdao, China ran very well in the third quarter. Asia operating results are still well ahead of last year's level through the quarter and through the first 9 months. Sales volumes in North America were relatively flat through the first 9 months compared to a year ago. We continue to focus on controlling costs, and we were seeing a more favorable sales mix in that business, which has resulted in higher comparable segment operating earnings in the quarter and year-to-date.  European third quarter operating results on a euro basis were up 8%, however, on a U.S.-dollar basis, were lower due to a weaker euro exchange rate. Year-over-year third quarter volume gains were somewhat offset by continuing price cost squeeze in that beverage can business. Third quarter earnings in the U.S. metal food and household products segment were less than expected due to Midwest drought, but slightly improved over last year. Year-to-date earnings in this business were below last year due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. With that said, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to be noticeably higher in the fourth quarter of 2011 when we took a significant amount of manufacturing downtime for inventory control. So far, 2002 (sic) [2012] has been a successful but tough year, with customer volume shifts in 12-ounce, growing specialty can demand, challenging growing conditions for our food can customers and 3 new plants coming online. I'm proud of our people who have effectively managed through these challenges and opportunities and expect a good finish to the year. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thank you, Ray. Our aerospace business continued to perform well, with solid execution on existing programs and strong new wins that set us up well for the future. Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up and, as you can see from our better-than-expected segment earnings, program performance is quite good. Margins for the quarter remained in the double digits. And as I mentioned earlier, contracted backlog ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. While uncertainty remains around the U.S. government plans and sequestration, Ball's strong track record should keep us well positioned no matter the outcome of this important issue. In summary, after a very good 9-month performance which was slightly above our expectations, we remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth for 2012. While it's a bit premature to discuss our 2013 outlook, we are proactively focusing on cost optimization and growth opportunities that will drive future performance and continued strong free cash flow. We are on track to fill the gap in 2013 related to North American volume shift. Further emerging market growth, mix shifts to more specialty containers, more normalized weather in North America and Europe and continued growth in aerospace all should serve as catalysts for good performance next year and beyond. We will continue our long-standing disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders, manage existing operations to match market demand and grow the EVA dollars we generate over the near and long term. And with that, Amit, we're ready for questions. Amit, if you would, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'll ask 3 questions and turn it over. First of all, Ray, could you give us a breakdown in the third quarter of what volumes were on a year-on-year basis? I think I saw in the press release and in your -- heard in your remarks more of a year-to-date comment. So could you run that by us in terms of a year-on-year for the third quarter volume progression?
Raymond J. Seabrook: You want that? Yes, I -- the -- in the North America/Asia segment -- our North America business was up just slightly, and in China and Brazil, they were up -- they were both up in the 20% range. In Europe, we had a strong volume quarter. We had volumes up almost 10% in Europe. And of course, they were down in food and household.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Did you have a food and household number?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. Remember, we've got an aerosol in the food business. So the aerosol was down about 4%, and food was down about 7%.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Next question, can you -- I think John mentioned that you're making progress to filling some of the volume that you had seen shift this year for '13. If possible, could you provide a bit more color in terms of that process? And are you worried at all about perhaps some of the negative publicity around energy drinks recently, what that might mean in terms of your efforts and your customer's demand?
John A. Hayes: Yes, George. With respect to your first question, the -- with the closure of our Columbus facility and taking out effectively 4 lines, of which 2, 2.5 were being utilized this year, we're going to be pretty tight next year overall.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. George, I would tell you that, I think, next year, we look like we might have a half line open, which is fundamentally full.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Exactly. And so we feel pretty good about the necessary decisions we had to make there. Obviously, it's dependent upon what happens in the marketplace, but we're assuming a relatively flat market for 2013. And then with respect to your question about energy, no, we're not overly concerned. It's not a big part of our portfolio. It's certainly less than 5%. And if we had to, we could move that over into the beer segment relatively quickly because we have been running very strong on the specialty side of our house. And we continue to expect to have strong growth in that segment as well.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And last one, on aerospace, the backlog, nice pick up. Is there any way that you can comment, realizing a lot of these programs are in the black, in terms of where the backlog improvement was?
John A. Hayes: Yes. What I would tell you, George, is most of that backlog is, as you described, in the black. And so we really can't comment on it. But we have some -- there's certainly some good wins there that we feel good about.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: It's actually Matt Wooten sitting in for Ghansham today. With many in the industry adding specialty can capacity in North America, can you quantify the current pace of volume growth? And do have any concern about the specialty can capacity in the near term? And if not, how about over the next 2 to 3 years?
John A. Hayes: Well, our specialty growth has been quite strong over the past couple of years. I think I mentioned, on the second quarter, year-to-date, it was up mid-20%, and we continue that pace right now. So I think it's very strong. It's masking obviously the decline in 12-ounce. And what we're seeing from our customers, not only North America but around the world, increased emphasis and interest on specialty sizes, everything from a 5.5-ounce, all the way up to the jumbo can. In terms of new capacity coming on, there's a lot of growth that's occurring in it. We constantly monitor that. And obviously, we're not going to be doing anything that we don't have business contracted for like we always do. So no, as we sit here today, we're not overly concerned about it because it's a good news story with respect to the growth.
Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I appreciate the color. And then as a follow on and back to the aerospace business for a second, recognizing that backlog was really high, have you seen any signs or any negative implications of a pending fiscal cliff in the U.S.?
John A. Hayes: Well, the short answer is no because we've been given no guidance by the -- our customers on this, because I don't think they know what's going on. The one thing that I can tell you is many of these new projects, and somewhat, most of our existing projects are of a strategic nature. And so we think, at least in the short term, they are reasonably well inoculated from any issues. Certainly we have some product lines that are more tactical in nature that could have some impact, but it's a very small part of our portfolio. So as we sit here today, we don't expect any meaningful dislocation relative to our business wins there. But obviously, time will tell. If it goes late into 2013, I think all cards are on the table. But as we sit here for the next, call it, 6 months or so, we feel pretty good.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I know it's still pretty early in the process, but how should we be thinking about pricing in 2013? I'm particularly interested in any color around Europe and China. I mean, demand/supply seems to be firming up in Europe, but a little more challenging in China.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, I think you're right. China, fundamentally, we're sitting with a -- the industry is sitting with probably 25% excess capacity. That excess capacity is being eaten up pretty quickly by, obviously, the growth in the market. I would say that the next 18 to 24 months, we should see that excess capacity eaten up. But in China, the pricing is difficult. What's helping us in China obviously is the volume growth. So I would say, from a perspective, pricing is difficult but volume is making up for the difference. In Europe, again, there is a little bit of excess capacity in certain spots. It's probably more in the east than the west. And pricing has been difficult, but we are seeing signs of that starting to firm up a little bit.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you give us a sense of what your outlook is for growth in China? Because there is -- I mean, at least Alcoa lowered their guidance pretty sharply. I just want to get your view.
John A. Hayes: Yes. We actually even had a board meeting this past week in China. And the fundamentals, I think, still remain quite strong. Ray talked about the overcapacity, but there's a tremendous amount of can filling investment going in. And despite some of the slowdown on a GDP basis in China, the rise of the middle class is still continuing. This migration from the rural areas to the urban areas that we've discussed in the past is continuing on. Ray had mentioned earlier that our volume was quite strong, and I think the overall industry volume was good, largely because the can has a share, the package mix is small. And so I think -- certainly, there is -- like in any market that's growing so strongly, you're going to have hiccups here and there. But we think long term the China market is still going to be pretty healthy.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one last final question for me. Historically speaking, you guys have allocated capital pretty evenly between CapEx, M&A and just returning cash to shareholders. 2012 was more of a robust year in terms of growth with Brazil and China. You guys have done an incredible job of buying back stock. How should we be thinking about the split for 2013?
Scott C. Morrison: It's pretty early right now. But our balance sheet is in great shape, we don't have much in the way of current maturity. So we won't be paying down debt other than current -- what comes due. And growth CapEx is dependent upon the opportunities that present themselves. And absent that, we'll use most of the free cash flow to buy back our stock.
John A. Hayes: The third leg of that is the whole M&A side, and that's kind of like growth capital. It's opportunity-driven. And if we see good opportunities, which, from time to time we do -- witness the Envases transaction -- we'll utilize that. But you never -- we never go into any given year planning on spending x percent or x amount of dollars on M&A.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: From your vantage point, I guess, between -- the split between growth on the emerging market side versus M&A, would the bias be more towards M&A this year? I mean, for 2013?
John A. Hayes: We just -- our bias is returning capital in the most prudent way and creating value in the most prudent way for our shareholders. And so our M&A activities as well as our external growth opportunities are opportunity-specific. And so absent anything that, we're going to buy back -- continue to buy back our stock and return that capital to our shareholders.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Res.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Could you talk a little bit about -- it seems like, from what we've been hearing and -- from some of the beverage companies that the beer business in Europe has been a bit stronger than what you would think reading the headlines. And what do you ascribe that to? And is it mostly affecting the can business more than bottles? Or how would you view the beneficiary of that?
John A. Hayes: Well, I don't know if the beer business in Europe or at large is all that strong. I certainly know that the overall beer can market in Europe in the third quarter was relatively flat. Now a lot of that had to do with poor weather in Western Europe and the U.K. And I know the can has not been losing share in the beer market. So I think perhaps maybe better than expectations, but it's certainly not blowing the lights out.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. It just looked like -- I asked that because SABMiller talked about having very strong volumes over there. But maybe it's just that one company.
John A. Hayes: Yes.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Yes. And then as a follow-up, and you might have addressed this, but given that one of your competitors has postponed some of their capital spending or projects in China and Brazil, do you think the longer-term outlook there isn't as strong as maybe you thought earlier? Or do you think it's more just tied to the economy? And I'm really thinking about China because I know you all pointed out a year ago how low the beer penetration is in cans versus other substrates when you look at China versus other parts of the world.
John A. Hayes: Yes. No, I -- we still think, long-term, the fundamentals are very strong. For example, the beer market in China year-to-date is up 6.5%, irrespective of package type. And so obviously, that's a good news story. I think really why some of these projects are sliding to the right, even for ourselves, has much to do with supply and demand and -- more than anything else. But as Ray pointed out, with the growth we're seeing in China, that could be sopped up relatively quickly. And so you just got to -- we're keeping our eye on that and being close to our customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. First, could you give us a little more color on the couple of acquisitions that you announced? The facility in Italy, how big is it, a couple of lines, et cetera, what you expect there, and is it full or capacity opportunity there, number one? And a little more color potentially on what you hope to do with the aerosol assets?
John A. Hayes: Well, first, with respect to the small Italian acquisition, that was, as I said, the beverage can portion of it. They had a very old, small outdated line that we're going to be taking out of their facility and moving those volumes into existing Ball facilities. And that will free up that existing line for deployment in other parts of the world as we continue to explore other geographies. With respect to Envases del Plata, we've talked over the last 18 months or so about our strategic thrust on the aluminum impact extruded side. We acquired Aerocan about 18 months ago, and this is just the logical next step. We're taking -- acquiring in its entirety their Mexican plant. And then we're joint venturing. We have at tinplate business down in Argentina. They obviously have an aluminum impact extruded. We share similar customers so we're forming a joint venture there with options in the future to either acquire it or dispose it back to the seller. We're in the midst of our due diligence now finalizing that, and we're subject to regulatory approval. And that's a little bit unknown right now, but we expect, as we sit here today, for these things to, most likely, close in the fourth quarter.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. The last 2 quick ones I had were, as you look globally at capacity, with volumes up so strong in Europe and then you talked about some of the elements here with Italy, it sounds like that's going to be folded into existing and can somewhat close. Do you -- I think you've -- are towards the end of your plant openings that you've announced globally with elements in Vietnam and China, et cetera. Do you envision any areas of the world where you might need further capacity as you look out the next year or two?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Brazil. We -- that new plant we just built -- we have a good customer that is just down the road. And we've just found out lately we have another one of our good customer is also building a brewery down the road. So I think we're going to need more capacity in Brazil. And that's the immediate capacity that I see. John?
John A. Hayes: Yes. And probably, over the next year or two, we've talked about this before, but we're getting recently [ph] tight in Europe. We've had some pricing issues, and I think our #1 focus and priority is getting those pricing issues right before we focus on any incremental capacity. And so -- I think we talked about that either in the first or second quarter conference call. And so that's what -- our plan right now. But go to the longer term, if Europe at large continues to grow as it is, we are going to need some capacity. We just want to focus on getting our business right there, first.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes. And then the last one is as you kind of [indiscernible] and went through some of the puts and takes, as you think about 2013, and then you've got a couple of these acquisitions to add, you still have some flow-through from plants you've brought online as they come up the learning curve. You've got some headwinds here in North America with business moving around, although you've done good work to fill those in. As you think about all these and put them together, does 2013, in your mind, seem to shake out as though you can still kind of fit within your long-term earnings growth objective?
John A. Hayes: It's premature to say that right now because obviously, we're in the midst of our planning process. But what I'd tell you is, largely because of the North American volume shift, we -- our guys have done a great job of clawing back to profitability in that business. But it took away some of the upside in it. So as we sit here right now -- it probably would be difficult to certainly get to the upper end of that range, but we're certainly focused on trying to achieve that lower end of the range, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What volume trends did you experience in Europe intra-quarter? And what regional differences existed, if any?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, as I said, we had a very strong volume quarter in the third quarter in our European beverage can. And that's mainly because -- if you remember, last year, summer didn't show up in Europe. So the last year's third quarter was dreadful. So that's why I think probably everybody was up fairly substantial in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're up about 5%, with the market growing about 3%. And for us, our business is primarily concentrated in Western Europe. Of course, we do have operations in Eastern Europe. And Western Europe was a little bit stronger-growing than East Europe. John, do you have anything to add?
John A. Hayes: The only outlier to what Ray just said was the U.K., where the weather was atrocious throughout the second and third quarter. And I think overall volumes, from an industry and for ourselves, were down in the U.K. But outside of that, Ray is spot on.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And just one for Scott. Scott, by roughly how much have your CapEx expectations come down for this year?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, as we've moved through the year, things have kind of slid to the right a little bit. That's why I've said for -- the most we've spent in a quarter -- we spent a little over $200 million through 9 months. And the most we've spent in a quarter historically is about $140 million. That's why I think we're going to trend lower than the $350 million. How much lower depends on how much -- how many things get closed out by the end of the year versus sliding to the right a little bit.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Right. But you would -- I would expect, in the future, you'd still be spending in excess of the $200 million of maintenance CapEx?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes. We're still seeing growth opportunities. We're seeing selective places where we still want to deploy capital and where we can get the returns. So we're going to continue to do that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on the 2013, just referencing some commentary from the last quarter call about Americas/Asia. You've been talking a couple of times on this call about the gap that you have to fill for the capacity closure. Is it fair to say that -- with the commentary hopefully better than flattish, I think was the comment made last quarter for what next year's EBIT could look like in this segment. Is that a fair characterization, that it would be kind of somewhere between flattish and what you're seeing this year, kind of in the low-single digits? Or how are you thinking about that? Is there a risk that it's actually down next year, that you actually -- you have something else to make up for?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. I think it was me that made that comment. And what I would tell you is that we've been very fortunate in the U.S. We've filled up -- we pretty much filled up the open capacity that we had. I said I think we have about a half line open in all of our system in the U.S. for '13, and that's pretty much full. And we expect -- Brazil is still growing for us, and we're expecting another very strong year in Brazil. And while price is very difficult in China, volume is very good. So as we sit here today, I would tell you, I expect it to be up a little bit from where it is this year.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then just on China, just out of curiosity, I mean, there's -- it's a more fragmented market than the other markets. So with some of the slowing growth and the excess capacity there, would you think that there's a possibility that this market kind of consolidates sooner than we might have otherwise thought, maybe 6 to 12 months ago?
John A. Hayes: I think that's a fair comment. And I think there's a reasonable shot at something like that. You just think about what we've done and then what we read about what our competitors have done in terms of things sliding to the right. I think there is a general recognition that there is overcapacity. And typically, when the industries have overcapacity, there's consolidation. So obviously we keep our eyes open to those types of things all the time. And if it makes sense, we'd certainly look at it.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just on kind of Asia in general. One of your peers has pretty significant exposure in Asia x China. You kind of made the move in Vietnam. How are you thinking about perhaps other markets throughout Asia at this stage? Is this -- would this be a goal over the next couple of years? Or just how are you thinking about that?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think it's certainly an objective. You all know that through a joint venture, we've had an interest in Thailand for a long time and with that same partner, we've moved into Vietnam. And I think there's other opportunities, if they make sense, that we'd certainly look at them with our partners like that. So it's a been a good partnership. There's good growth throughout Southeast Asia from a volume perspective. And if we can make the economics work, we'd certainly take a look at it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just wondering if we could go back to Brazil, the comments you made about the new capacity coming on. I'm wondering if we should expect an even bigger volume bump in the next quarter as you continue to ramp up. It was my impression that when you did -- I think it was Tres Lagos [ph]? Please correct me if I'm wrong -- 2011, that that ramp up went pretty quickly? And then I guess my follow-up on that would be do you see the need to add more capacity in that region over the next few years? Are you happy with your current footprint or where you would actually just add another line at one of these facilities? Or would you expect that you need to move out of that area?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, for us -- remember, Brazil this year started off very, very slowly. We had a very, very slow first quarter in Brazil. And the second quarter was better, but it was still very, very slow. And then they were going to have a tax on beverages, and they've moved that back. And in the third quarter, it's really taken off for us, and we're expecting a very strong fourth quarter as well. As I said before, at least initially, we're not -- we're going to fill out plants as opposed to building another plant. We've only got one line in that new Alagoinhas plant we built, and there's certainly room for some more capacity to be added in there, and that's what I would expect to happen in the next very short period.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just kind of moving out of region, we haven't discussed -- I've seen a lot of announcements of capacity coming on in South Africa, and I believe some of the major players provide either technology or ends to that market. And I'm just wondering if that will ever become a market that you guys might be willing to move into?
John A. Hayes: Well, the short answer is we take a look at markets like that all the time. It's a market where the can demand has not been growing, and they're having some economic difficulties down there. So I wouldn't expect anything, in the very short term, for us to be doing anything. But we do, from time to time, look at opportunities like that. And if we can make economic sense, as I said before, we would certainly proceed on -- with those.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more question on China. We've asked a lot about the need for more consolidation in that market, and my characterization has always been that the existing players would probably want a little bit more than what you or some of your peers would be willing to pay. And I'm just wondering what kind of the strategy would be, if there are not some smaller, maybe self-manufacturers or single-plant players that you guys think you might be able to consolidate over the next year or so. That would be helpful.
John A. Hayes: Well, I think, as I said before, generally speaking, when there is overcapacity in markets, you see consolidation. And usually, what happens is the big -- the strong remain strong, and the weak ones are the ones that are consolidated. So it falls directly in line with what you were just saying. And if it works for us from an economic point of view, from a geographic footprint point of view and from a customer portfolio point of view, we'd certainly look at it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just first question is on free cash flow. And certainly, the working capital improvement this year is impressive. I was just wondering what you think of the opportunity next year along those lines? Is the free cash flow next year sustainable relative to this year? You have CapEx down, but working cap might be hard to repeat. I just wanted to get some thoughts around that.
Scott C. Morrison: We've had a number of good programs that are benefiting us this year on the working capital front. We have some things that are yet to come that will happen next year. So I -- while it's too early to call what working capital will look like next year, I'm still fairly positive on how that will develop next year. So I don't think it's -- I don't think we're going to have to give anything back that we got this year necessarily.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. All right. And then also, related on -- just a quick housekeeping question on corporate costs. What should we be thinking about going forward? I know the second quarter was a little bit lower than I was expecting, at least -- or the third quarter, I'm sorry.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, they ran a little -- full year is going to run closer to $65 million because of the benefit that we got in the third quarter. On a full -- in a typical year, it should run a little bit higher than that. We had some unusual benefits in the third quarter that won't repeat themselves in the fourth quarter.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, okay. Got it. All right. Last question is just on -- is on the rationalizations in North American beverage. Is there a way to help us think about what the fixed cost reduction is associated with those? Or -- we know you're going to -- there's some volume loss there. Kind of help us with maybe what some of the offsetting is on the footprint side.
John A. Hayes: Well, if you recall, in the past, when we've closed facilities, we said the fixed cost savings was -- depending on facility, was in the range of $25 million or so. The Columbus plant was a little bit bigger than a typical plant, and we closed an end facility as well. So you should expect the fixed cost savings to be north of that. That's one of the reasons why both Ray and I said that we feel reasonably comfortable that we'll be able to claw back most if not all of the shortfall relative to volume loss.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Question is just around the share repurchase. I think you said, now that you're going to do about -- at least $500 million of share repo in 2012, if I look on the second quarter call, I think you were at $275 million year-to-date. It looks like, at the end of the 3 quarter, you bought back about $300 million of shares. How should we think about the timing of that? How do you sort of look at that and decide when is the best time to do share repo, or -- how do you think about that as we move into the balance of the year?
Scott C. Morrison: Well -- I mean, obviously, we try to be opportunistic if we can. But to buy $200 million in the last quarter, you've got to be buying it everyday.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. Okay. So you're actively in the market. I mean, is there a period -- a window when you have to -- when you're no longer allowed to buy near the end of the year? Or you can buy all the way through the year?
Scott C. Morrison: You could put a variety of programs in place to be able to buy through blackout periods. That's usually not problematic.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Looking at the North American slugs business, right, you've got significant market share there. You did an aerosol acquisition. What do you think about overall vertical integration of that business longer term? Do you think there's a -- do you have a target rate for vertical integration, or do you -- pretty comfortable with where you stand currently?
John A. Hayes: I think we're pretty comfortable with where we stand currently. We got in the business because as we started to explore the aluminum impact extruded, we realized the importance of having good quality slugs to make good quality containers, and that was the business premise behind getting in that. And so that hasn't changed at all. And so it is a good source of quality slugs for us. And then we don't have to point fingers at our suppliers.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. Okay. And then just lastly, I think somebody earlier talked about the negative publicity around energy drinks and the impact on your business. But I sort of look at it from a different angle. Is that -- maybe this is an opportunity for you. We've heard a lot about reclosable and resealable options for cans. It doesn't seem to have been adopted very much, whether -- at least in North America. Do you think this is maybe an opportunity for you to advance some of the reclosable and resealable innovation that you have?
John A. Hayes: Well, it very well could be. Whether you want to talk about the Alumi-Tek bottle, you want to talk about the resealable end that we produced in Europe -- but actually, we do sell it here in North America. I do think whether it's energy drink or whether it's anything that is looking at portion control, there are opportunities there. And our business development folks are actively pursuing those.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I just wanted to get back to European bev cans. Obviously, this has already been asked, but I was shocked at how good that number was. I get the fact that the comp was easy. But just with how poor weather was, particularly in northern Europe in the quarter, is there any certain thing, or are you able to identify as to how much lift you think you got -- obviously from either the Olympics, or maybe a tail end of the Cup games, if that helps at all, either -- if there's something else going on there that drove that huge 10% growth number?
John A. Hayes: I think the biggest thing actually when you take a look at it from a volume perspective was the Benelux region was quite strong. And what's in the Benelux region is largely multinational beer companies that export out of that area into other geographies. And I think we're the -- a beneficiary of that. So if we had to isolate it to one thing, that was probably the biggest surprise relative to our own internal expectations.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow-up question, comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.
Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A quick follow-up, this is actually Gabe. In China, is there -- are there any sort of anti-competitive issues that would preclude you from making a purchase in any particular region within China, given that it's obviously a large country?
John A. Hayes: I think that that's such a general question, it's too difficult to answer. Obviously, we would have to be mindful that if we were to acquire something that was adjacent or very close to one of our facilities, in the absence of other competitors in the region, obviously that would be a challenge. But I think there's enough competitors out there that we could probably weave our way through.
Operator: There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time, Mr. Hayes. I will now turn the call back to you.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Well, thanks, Amit, and thank you everyone. I just want to remind everyone that our January earnings call will take place on Thursday, January 31, 2013. So we look forward to having a strong finish to the year, and we'll talk to you then. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2012 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow up with details about our packaging operating performance, and I'll close with comments on aerospace and the outlook for the second half of 2012. Today, Ball reported second quarter 2012 results slightly ahead of last year's results. Recall that we had mentioned in April that our first half results would be relatively flat as compared to the first half of 2011. And to date, we performed slightly better than we expected. Our Drive for 10 levers include maximizing the value of our existing businesses, broadening our geographic reach, expanding into new products and capabilities, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets, and leveraging our technology expertise to create competitive advantage. During the quarter, we made progress in all of these. And several highlights include new metal beverage container plants in Qingdao, China. Alagoinhas, Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam all began production in the second quarter, further broadening our geographic reach. The Alumi-Tek reclosable bottle continued to add to its customer portfolio as we expanded this product in the new end markets including craft beer and CSD. In fact, year-to-date, our total specialty can portfolio in North America grew approximately 24%. Ball Aerospace is leveraging its technological expertise. The B612 Foundation recently announced that Ball Aerospace will build a space telescope named Sentinel, which will scan the solar system for asteroids posing a threat to Earth. This will be the first privately-funded deep-space mission. And in addition to this, we want additional work that will soon be included in our backlog, highlighting the growth of this business despite an uncertain funding environment. We continue to make good progress in all 5 of our Drive for 10 strategic levers. And while we wish our end markets were just a little bit more robust, 2012 is progressing just as we expected. I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. I'll return with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2012. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2012 were $0.89 versus last year's $0.85. The following factors contributed favorably to the second quarter results: higher volumes in Brazil and China, as well as continued growth in specialty can volumes; solid program performance in aerospace business; a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted the second quarter by $0.04. For a complete summary of the second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Recapping the key financial metrics for 2012, interest expense will remain the same at approximately $175 million. Taking into account certain tax benefits achieved in the first half of the year, the full year 2012 effective tax rate is projected to be around 29%, so the tax rate in the remaining 2 quarters of 2012 will run closer to 32%. Given recent global growth trends, full year 2012 CapEx is now anticipated to be in the range of $350 million. With the change in CapEx and some improvements in working capital, we now expect 2012 free cash flow to be at least $0.5 billion, with most of the free cash flow being returned to shareholders through share repurchases. Year to date, we have repurchased approximately $275 million of our stock. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $3 billion, roughly flat versus 2011. With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Comparable second quarter operating earnings in the metal beverage Americas and Asia segment were up 8%, and through the first half, are up over last year's level. Remember, first quarter sales volumes in Brazil were slow due to customer geographic supply relocation. But as Scott mentioned, have picked up in the second quarter and are up 10% through the first half. We expect this trend to continue in the second half and still expect mid-teens growth in Brazil for the full year. Sales volumes in North America were relatively flat through the first half, with custom cans continuing to grow -- to show nice growth. Second quarter operating earnings in the Americas were up on the strength of tighter cost controls and better sales mix in North America, partially offset by higher cost inventory from Brazil production curtailments, primarily late in the first quarter and second quarter, and start-up costs at our new Alagoinhas plants, which came on line in the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we foresee the North American favorable sales mix continuing and expect that the Brazilian start-up costs are behind us. In Asia, the new can plants in Vietnam and Qingdao, China are performing well. And from an operating standpoint, we're coming out of start-up by the end of the second quarter. Sales volumes in China through the first half are up low double digits, with operating results a little ahead of last year's level in the quarter and for the -- and through the first 6 months. Comparable European operating results in the quarter were lower than a year ago, primarily due to a lower euro exchange rate, and to a lesser extent, some price cost squeeze in the beverage cans. Beverage can volumes in Europe were up low-single digits in the quarter and through the first 6 months in spite of poor early summer weather. Despite an appreciably lower euro exchange rate, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be comparable to or slightly better than a year ago due to some relatively easy comps. Second quarter and first half earnings in the U.S. Metal Food & Household Products segment were on plan, but below last year due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. Food can volumes through the first half were mid single-digit below last year's level, and this trend will probably continue in the second half due to the drought weather conditions being experienced in most of the U.S. Despite this difficult weather situation, we still foresee quarterly earnings -- segment earnings returning to a more typical seasonal pattern this year, which was reversed in 2011. With that said, we look forward to higher segment earnings in the second half than we earned in the first half. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Ray. Aerospace and technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margins for the quarter. Backlog ended the quarter at $780 million, which is holding in nicely, and as I mentioned earlier, is poised to grow as we move forward due to some recent wins. Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up, and the program performance in that business is excellent. As is evident with the Sentinel win, our aerospace team is executing on their Drive for 10 game plan. Our best cost, best value positioning provides Ball Aerospace a firm foundation heading into the election cycle. Now looking out beyond 2012, late in the second quarter, the company was notified of a shift in CSD customer requirements for our North American metal beverage packaging business beginning January 1, 2013. While we've lost some volume due to this shift, we have also gained some business from new and existing customers. In keeping with the Drive for 10 strategic lever of maximizing the value on our existing businesses, Ball will act appropriately in the -- to the resulting changes in supply and demand across our manufacturing footprint. And we are currently finalizing our plans, which are expected to include both permanent and temporary capacity realignment to address the situation. More information will be forthcoming in the near future regarding these activities. We believe that the net impact of this customer shift is not material to Ball's 2013 results and does not impede our ability to execute our Drive for 10 operational and financial goals. In summary, we are slightly better than what we had planned halfway through the year. And as we always do, we are responding to the market environment from a cost and capital perspective that should generate higher free cash flow this year. We will continue our long-standing disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders and grow our company. With a slightly improved first half behind us, we are positive about the rest of this year and beyond. Profitability in the back half of 2012 will ramp up as new emerging market plants and the food and household business enter their seasonally stronger quarters, and we remain on track to achieve our 10% to 15% diluted per earnings share growth goal. Recall that Drive for 10 is a mindset about perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goal to more than doubling the EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over that time. So with that, Jennifer, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess the first question I had, you said you wouldn't let us know about your plans for, I guess, capacity and production within North America at some point in the future. Will that happen before the third quarter earnings call, or when do you expect that you might be able to talk a little bit more about that?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, George, this is Ray. The -- some details on that plan probably will be announced before the third quarter call, I would suspect. So let me see if I can lay this out for you. So late in 2011, we extended a long-term customer contract. And as part of that extension, as John mentioned in his comments, we picked up some fairly substantial volume, which would start in '13. And so that's been done. And as part -- and then I would say, in probably 3 or 4 weeks ago, we were notified by our customer that we'd lost some volume in '13. We've lost more than we've picked up. And so we have put together a tentative plan that, as John mentioned, rationalizes some surplus capacity. We've been doing a lot of shipping of our specialty cans across the country, so we're going to use this situation to improve our specialty can footprint. So we're going to do some of that. And then the capacity that we rationalize, we're going to move it to growing markets. So what you'll find is when we move this capacity, it costs us about half as much to install capacity that has been reconditioned as opposed to buying new. So that's the initial plan. We have 2 or 3 -- we have several near-term opportunities that probably will flesh themself out in the next 60 days. And once we see what those look like -- and those opportunities primarily are not in 12-ounce cans or specialty cans and other things. And so once we flesh those out, we'll finalize our plans and move forward. So as John said, the initial look at this is that it's not that significant to us as we look at '13. Does that help?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, it does. I appreciate the color. One additional follow-on to that, and then maybe a couple other quick ones, I'll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that what you lost is maybe 2x what you gained going into this year? And does this affect at all the Columbus lines that I know you haven't been running this year?
John A. Hayes: George, this is John. I think it's premature to talk about any of that right now. It's -- I think the key highlight is, we've got a game plan. We have a variety of stakeholders that we need to deal with. And at the appropriate time, we'll let people know what that is.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Sure. I mean this has been a long time coming, so it's probably not a total surprise here. I guess, can you comment at all in terms of how the new plants are coming up the learning curve? Have you gotten to a point where they are at least breakeven from a margin standpoint? Are they still -- from an earnings standpoint, are they still dilutive at this juncture on the curve?
Raymond J. Seabrook: They're pretty much -- as we sit here today, they might be out of it. But pretty much for the second quarter, they were all in start-up. So they were dilutive. So they weren't adding anything. They've all come up differently. So the plant in Vietnam, it's come up a little slower because the work force is totally new. And it just takes time to learn how to do this thing. So Vietnam is fine, but it's come up a little slower. Qingdao, which is the one in China has come up quicker. But remember, we relocated a lot of employees from an old plant that we shuttered to the new plant. So we had much more expertise in Qingdao. So it's come up better. And as a matter of fact, we're even converting it to a different size right now as we speak. And then the one in Brazil, as I mentioned in the first quarter, we had some customer relocation situations with it. So it's really wasn't much -- it really wasn't a situation for the plant not coming up. It was to get the customer situation sorted out, and that's been done. So they're all a little bit different. But they're kind of all running now to speed, and we expect, as I said, a better third quarter.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So Alagoinhas is where you wanted it in the second quarter and...
Raymond J. Seabrook: Alagoinhas, yes, it's now where we wanted it, but it took a while to get there because if you'll remember, we got a new customer location there. And so it just took a little longer than we had first anticipated.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Understood. The last one for John. John, what does Sentinel add to the backlog? And do you have a view on project awards that have been funded that maybe didn't get to your June 30 backlog, what that would -- what that increment might look like?
John A. Hayes: Yes, Sentinel is not funded, and it's not in the backlog as well. The non-for-profit, the 501(c)(3) needs to go through a fundraising exercise. But they have announced that we will be the prime in building that. So it's a bit uncertain when they'll do that fundraising. We have in there very -- in the past couple of weeks have won a couple of other things in the classified world that, for obvious reasons, we can't talk about, but we believe will add materially to our backlog in the second half of the year and most likely in the third quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: John, just more color on the CapEx reduction. Which regions does this adjustment -- which region is this specific to? And also, is this a function of you not winning some business that you thought you might have had at the beginning of the year, or is it just market condition based?
John A. Hayes: No, it's exclusively market condition based. And what I would say is things are moving out to the right. The overall growth of the global economy has slowed down. So I hope people aren't surprised by this. We're being prudent about it. But, as you know, the vast majority of our growth capital was allocated more towards Asia, generally speaking. So I think the vast majority of what's being pushed to the right is probably in that same area.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe I misheard this, but the custom cans, were they up 24% year-over-year in North America? Is that right?
John A. Hayes: That's correct.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And where were standard cans down for the quarter in North America?
John A. Hayes: Ray, do you have that?
Raymond J. Seabrook: No, I don't have that. But, obviously, that was the difference, obviously. So we were flat. So if -- you can kind of do the math.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, I can try and do that. And the volume trajectory in Europe on the beverage can side, has that changed inter-quarter, month-to-month?
John A. Hayes: It was -- in the second quarter, it was a little bit slower than the first quarter. I think the big reasons for that were largely weather. It's -- we talked last year, this time last year, about Europe having a terrible summer for weather. Well, it's equal to or worse this year than it was last year. Offsetting that, we had some of the World Cup and some others things going through. So we've been holding our own. But it was up low-single digits.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. On Americas, Asia, the cost-mix benefit in North America, any -- can you calibrate roughly how much is cost and mix there?
John A. Hayes: Ray?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, it's more mix than cost. I don't know the exact numbers, but I would say that it's 70-30. The mix been 70% of the improvement and 30% being cost.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. And just with respect to the specialty cans and the mix benefit there, would you say you're pretty much fully ramped on that benefit in the second quarter in terms of how we think about the run rate of that towards the -- through the second half?
John A. Hayes: Well, when you say fully ramped, I'm not quite sure. We expect continued growth in the specialty cans side of the business. We've -- for external market reasons, and we've been doing a lot of marketing and push from that overall product line, whether it's the Alumi-Tek bottle, smaller sizes, larger sizes, punch-top ends, things like that. It's a whole variety of different things.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, I guess I was just referring to -- I mean, you brought on some new capacity, and I was just wondering if you're kind of -- you're essentially running full, getting the full profit benefit today?
John A. Hayes: Well, we're certainly running very strong.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, we are to a point -- as I said before, the footprint isn't quite the way we'd like it. So we're spending a lot of money in freight shipping stuff in places we'd rather make it close to where our customer is. So we're going to fix that.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. And just with the CapEx reduction for this year, how should we think about preliminary thoughts around CapEx for next year? Perhaps, Scott, you could kind of talk about maintenance and whatever carryover there might be from any existing projects that would be kind of the starting point for next year?
Scott C. Morrison: Sure. Well, it's a little early to talk about CapEx for next year. But think about -- we just started up 3 new plants, and so just to keep up with incremental growth, you don't need to spend as much capital. So I would expect CapEx to trend down. But it's really more of a question of how strong global growth will be or not be. And I think we'll make more money next year, and so I think free cash flow probably goes up again next year. It's just a question of how much.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then final question is just on the comment about moving some of the can lines from North America to emerging markets and the cost saves from doing that. I mean, as you look at the emerging markets today, which markets do you think actually need new capacity? And if we think about Brazil and China, it feels like they don't.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, I said -- I purposely didn't -- I said growing. So you could even see some of the stuff -- we're fundamentally sold-out in Europe as we speak. So it's been growing 5% in the last -- since ever. So I'm not saying -- and it cost about half to redeploy -- to get a line in that's been refurbished versus buying new. So I don't know exactly as we sit here now where this is going, but it -- we definitely have growth markets for beverage cans. And this equipment that we rationalized as part of this exercise is going to end up somewhere where we need it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: When I look at your bev business, if I heard you correctly, volumes were up low-single digits. But your EBIT on a year-over-year basis was down considerably. So I just want to know if there are any other factors other than FX weighing on the quarter?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, the primary effect -- now remember, in the European numbers is also our extruded aerosol business, Aerocan. And the volumes were down just a little bit in that business, so it's not all beverage cans. So most of it is FX, but there's about EUR 6 million that probably is -- what I would classify as price cost. We haven't been able to pass on all our cost increases to our customers as part of our pricing...
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And that's also on the bev can side, is that correct?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Those are on the bev can side, yes.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And demand ticking up, I mean, at least holding up decently in Europe on the bev can side. How do you feel about pricing next year because as you mentioned earlier, supply sounds to be pretty tight at this point.
John A. Hayes: Well, as you'll recall, I think earlier this year on a conference call, we talked about in 2012 we had plans to put some capacity in. But we shelved those plans because we said, "You know what, there's price cost going on in the marketplace, and we need to get our pricing right." So as we sit here today, Ray just mentioned that we continue to see some growth. But in terms of prioritization, our first priority is get our pricing right, and then we'll start to look at growth. And so as we go on the balance of 2012 and into 2013, that is kind of our strategy and go-to moves relative to what we're trying to do.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just one last final question for Ray. Demand for Brazil and China did pick-up in Q2. Is the back half still pretty robust? Because one of your competitors kind of talked about how both demand in China and Brazil is slowing. There's excise tax in the back half. So I just want to get a little clarity on what's giving you the confidence that demand is going to still be pretty solid?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, that's all true. We -- actually, we had lower demand in the first quarter. I think we're up like 30% in the second net-net through year-to-date. In Brazil, we're up 10%. I said in my comments that we expect full year to be up 17%. So that means that we got to have a pretty good back half. And in our particular can -- and the thing about the beer is correct. The new beer taxes has caused some slowdown. There's no question about it. But we really have our contracts in place and our customers' positions in place where we're highly confident with what I said is going to happen.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Regarding demand in Brazil, to what extent are you experiencing a slowdown of the conversion from returnable bottles to metal cans there? One of your competitors talked about that earlier decline.
John A. Hayes: Well, this is John. When you look at the aluminum can market growth in Brazil in the second quarter, it was reasonably healthy, both double digits in CSD and beer. I can tell you that on the beer side that we continue to see an uptick in can penetration. If you look year-over-year and again, you have to look at month-to-month, but it's up about a point. And we're not quite at 40%, but we're worth a stone's throw of that. And so we continue to see improvement there.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: With regard to the free cash flow guidance, how much of an additional benefit do you expect to get from better working capital versus lower CapEx?
Scott C. Morrison: There's a chunk of working capital, too. We've got a number of plans across all the businesses, really, a variety of different things that we're doing from an operation standpoint, a treasury standpoint, a sourcing standpoint that are all benefiting us. So we still expect -- part of the improvement of free cash flow for this year is coming from benefits that we're going to get on the working capital side. It's not all the CapEx.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just following up on the beer penetration question. Moving to Asia though, in particular, China, it sounded as if penetration there has slowed somewhat. I realize you're adding capacity slower than the market over there. But what are you seeing overall with can penetration in Asia? And how do you feel about your capacity additions versus market growth right now?
John A. Hayes: Why don't I talk about can penetration and Ray can talk about our capacity. I think in the second quarter, our overall beer market in China was up 5.5-or-so percent and cans were up double digits. So that says cans continue to have further penetration. Recall it's only in the beer segment, for example, it's only about 6% penetration. So there's a lot of room for improvement there. But as I said, it is growing -- the cans growing at a rate faster than the end beverage markets, which obviously means better can penetration.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, and as far as the capacity goes, our original plan in China this year, we were importing, I think, 300 million or 400 million cans. And I think that's gone down. As you said, the market has slowed a little bit. But fundamentally, we're sold-out. Every can we could make, we're selling. So -- and as we look to next year, we are putting in a little capacity this year. We've -- some of that slowed. We've had some issues getting some land in the South that we thought we had. So we will be sold-out again next year. So everything we can make, we can sell.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just overall for the metal beverage and Asia business, looks like operating profit was essentially flat in the first half of the year. You had said before, I think, that you thought you could get the operating earnings up somewhere in the 10% to 15% range for this segment for the year. How are you feeling about that right now? And do you think you can get there with improvement in the second half?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, we will definitely improve in the second half. There's no question about it. The -- whether I can get to the 10% to 15%, I think, is more difficult now because we're a little slower than we thought. But we will come close to the bottom part of that range. Let's put it that way.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And how much do you think currency is impacting that though?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, we've had a little negative currency in China actually. And the Brazil currency tends to devalue, which really doesn't have an impact -- such a big impact to us. We have lost actually a little currency in our China business.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on this shift in business in North America. I mean, it sounds as if maybe it's more of a price issue rather than you not having obviously the capacity to serve the customer. Is that your sense of the shift in volumes at this point?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, these things happen from time-to-time. If you -- I think some of it is sheet for me since 1990 on who's gained, who's lost, volume, and actually, I think we're net-net. I think after this that we're like 500 million with where we started with. So these things come and go a little bit. Usually, if you lose volume, it's price. And we don't do things for practice here. And we're not going to do things for practice. So we've got a plan to deal with this situation. So we're going to deal with it and try to make the most amount of money we can.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: A couple of questions. Scott, I wondered, look like you made some changes recently in depreciation assumptions. Can you just give us a little background on that?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we looked at all of our -- if you look at our 10-K, there is a fairly detailed explanation of what we did. But we looked at -- as we standardized accounting practices around the world, if you look at the different lines that we're using in different places, and so we standardize that. And with that came a change in depreciation. What also happened was change in how we expensed some things, too. So net-net, on a full year basis, there really wasn't much of a difference. But that was the change.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then over in food and beverage, can you talk about the fallout, if any, from the drought? And can you also talk about how much that slug business may be adding to EBIT right now?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, this is Ray. The slug business is fairly small. It's up year-over-year. In our food can business, you've heard a lot of commenting on corn. We heard a lot of comment on the radio about corn. Corn is not that big of an impact for us. We're much heavily weighted towards, let's say, green beans or tomatoes. And the drought certainly has an impact. But it hasn't impacted those crops quite as bad as it has corn. The yield even on corn is something like 50%. So our guys -- it's going to hurt us no doubt in the second half from otherwise what it would have done. But I don't think it's a huge impact for us. It'll be lower, but not that significant.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: If you try to put that in just volume terms, right, what would it be, kind of a ballpark, as you see it right now?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I got it more on EBIT terms. But in volume terms, it's probably a 2% or 3% lower than otherwise for us it would have been.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And in EBIT?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, I got it in my head, I'm not trying [indiscernible]. I've got it, but I'm not sure I'm sharing it.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And, John, probably can you just talk about the acquisition landscape and whether you think given the slowing in emerging markets, whether that may present some more opportunities for you if you're patient over the next year or 2?
John A. Hayes: Yes, I think you've hit the nail on head. I do think when you look at where Ball has been successful about acquisitions, it's usually not in times of rosy economic environments, but in more challenging ones. And I'm thinking back into the 2009 when we acquired Metal Container. I'm thinking about the 2006 time frame when we acquired U.S. Can and then back -- even going as far back as 2002 into the headwinds of a credit issue in Germany, we did quite well with Schmalbach. The environment today feels a bit like that. And I think sellers' expectations are coming down. You guys know we're very disciplined in what we do. And so sometimes we're quite competitive than in an acquisition sense, and sometimes we're not because credit is flowing freely, and we have to compete with sponsors, et cetera. But it does feel a little bit better today and as we go forward, not only in developed markets but also, as you said, in developing markets that expectations are becoming a little bit more rational.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: It's actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. Just 2 quick questions. A lot of ours have been answered. You mentioned weak volume conditions still in standard cans in North America. Any signs of the major CSD players picking up promotions so far this summer?
Raymond J. Seabrook: That's been one of the issues that there hasn't been a lot of promotion in CSD. I think there's been pockets. But generally speaking, most of our customers have been sticking to their knitting, and they've been going for price and not volume. And I said there's been pockets of it, but there's probably more promotion in beer than there has been in soft drinks.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then Scott, can you quantify that impact of currency to European beverage at all for 2Q?
Scott C. Morrison: From a translation standpoint or on the -- I'm sorry, on the EBIT side you said?
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: Yes.
Scott C. Morrison: I think the translation was $10 million of EBIT in the quarter from a currency standpoint. The rest was the price cost mix that Ray talked about.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Crédit Suisse.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just on Europe bev, you guys, from the sounds of it, outperformed the overall industry a little bit in the second quarter. And I was wondering if you gained any share this year, or if that's just a geographic mix difference?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I think maybe a tad, but not much. I think we did outperform the market just a little bit. And I think we did gain just -- but it's not a lot. It's -- the shares are still fairly comparable, but I think we did gain a little bit of share.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And can you just help us with -- if you saw any noticeable differences by region across Europe, how that's trending recently?
John A. Hayes: Across Europe, generally speaking, I think in the West -- in the Western part of Europe, it's actually held up okay, for example, in the Benelux region, which is a big export for many of the multinational beer companies there. That's been reasonably healthy. You've clearly seen some softness in the U.K. because of the weather. I don't know who watched the British Open, but you could see how wet it was there. And then as you go into the East, it varies so much. You have some strength in certain areas and some weaknesses in other areas. So I don't think there's big, big deviations between regions in what I just said, however.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful. On the aerospace side, you had a great second quarter there. And I was wondering if that's a sustainable EBIT that you see, or if there was any kind of benefit from onetime project closeout benefits, or how we should be thinking about the run rate for aerospace with the backlog you've got?
John A. Hayes: Yes, the short answer, there was no big material onetime items that impacted the second quarter. Our guys are performing very well. As we've talked about this in the past, we have a bit more -- a fixed cost business as a percent of the total business, which usually is helpful from a margin perspective. And that, combined with our strong execution, we feel pretty good about that business.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And along those lines, you've indicated some potential new business that you're looking at or bidding on there if I caught other earlier comments right. And I was just wondering if you could just help us with potential size of that as relative to backlog. What's in the pipeline there, or what are you seeing for potential new business?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think maybe you hopped on late. We did talk about that we've won some new business. It hasn't been booked, but we expect in third quarter for it to book, and we expect it to be material. Remember, it wasn't, what, 18 months ago that we're close to $1 billion of backlog. We weren't quite there. We can see a line of sight if certain things happen that within the next short period of time, probably not in the third quarter but certainly over the next few quarters, that we could be at or even above that level where we were just 18 months ago.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Was that aerospace or packaging, that question?
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: It was aerospace. Okay, great, that's helpful. And then the last question is just housekeeping on the corporate line. It was lower than at least I expected this quarter. And I was wondering what we should be thinking about for corporate expense?
Scott C. Morrison: This should be similar to what it was last year for full year. There were just some things that occurred in the quarter that were a little bit favorable, but we don't expect those to continue. So full year numbers should be very comparable to last year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: If we go around the world and just focus on your beverage can business in the key regions, can you provide a guesstimate or maybe you actually have the data of what the market was up in the second quarter and the first half for beverage can demand?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Let me give you the U.S. So the -- let's start with the U.S. So the quarter was down a little bit. You got soft drinks down, and you had beer up. But net-net, the quarter was down about 2%, a little bit less. And then year-to-date, it's kind of flat. And in Europe, you've got the quarter down about 1%, or flattish or down to 1%. And you've got year-to-date of 3%.
John A. Hayes: Up 3%.
Raymond J. Seabrook: The numbers -- yes, up 3%. In Brazil, you've got about 8% market growth in the quarter year-to-date. And I think that was about the same for the second quarter. And in China, it's somewhere between 9% and 12% year-to-date.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. Right. And then Scott, did you guys buy back any stock in July thus far?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, the comments I made in the prepared comments is through year-to-date, through right now, we've repurchased about 275 million net of shares.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's year-to-date. I thought that was for this second half. Okay, and then it's been really impressive to see how much stocks you bought back over the last couple of years, evident in the share price performance. Looking forward, can you just remind us how you think about buying back stock versus potentially a special dividend versus potentially a more incremental sustainable dividend?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we look at the dividend level all the time. We've raised that quite a bit in the last couple of years. But we continue to orient most of our returning value to shareholders through share buyback. And we'll continue to do that. But we do always evaluate what level of dividends we're paying, and where we want to be so.
John A. Hayes: And one of the positives, at least as we sit here today, is tell us what the government's policy is going to be 6 or 9 months from now and we can probably have a firmer answer. But with the elections coming up, I think there's lot of things on the table our government needs to deal with.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of -- kind of help me clarify a few items. When I look at -- Scott, you said that the total impact was about 10 million of currency translation in the Euro bev piece, I believe. If I look at the 19 million differential, at least there's 9 other that part price, but volume were up as well. So can you maybe help me, if you don't mind, parse what the differential is? How that -- the price cut, how that continues through the rest of the year? And then really what I'm trying to drive at, and I think this goes along with another question is, do you feel that in 2013 you can recover a chunk of that?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, I'll give you -- I'll talk a little bit about the quarter though, and maybe let Ray chime in. In the quarter, that [ph] was currency. Remember, we said Aerocan was a little bit softer, so that was a couple. And the rest was on the beverage side price cost mix with volume obviously offsetting some of the price cost, but not all of it. So going forward, as John mentioned in his comments, one of the things we need to do is improve the price cost situation in Europe. And I think we're going to be real focused on that as we move into '13.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And is that event you can do in '13, you believe, carve back even half of that?
John A. Hayes: Well, it's...
Scott C. Morrison: The short answer is, it's too early to tell, but that's what's going to be our objective.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if you can help me clarify earlier comments where you talked about -- you tried to provide us some color around -- or at least some thoughts around preliminary -- what the contract movements and then what your own actions on the specialty cans and then realignment -- things could do for '13 versus changes. I think you said it would not be material to the enterprise. So -- I mean, should I basically interpret that as 2013 EBIT out of your metal beverage, Americas, Asia could be at worst case flat?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, I -- obviously, it will be lower than otherwise it would have been without the loss of business. No question about that. With the growth in China and Brazil, I would say that that's a reasonable assumption. I think we -- it's too early to predict '13, but based on things that we know, we would tell you that '13 will be flatter than it otherwise would be. And we don't think that -- we think it will be flattish.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Our guys -- having said that, our guys in North America have done a very good job of planning. And while we haven't announced anything, they're well on their way to recouping most, if not all, of the impact there. And so work continues on that. As Ray said -- Ray articulately outlined some of the things we're thinking of, and so stay tuned.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, and the thing is, I would have stressed this, we do have some several near-term opportunities in specialty cans and even in some other things we're working on. So that's one of the reasons we haven't finalized our plans yet. We need to see how these things turn out. So -- and they're not 12-ounce opportunities. They're specialty cans and end situations. So stay tuned.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough. I guess this is a -- probably a question we'll follow-up with again, after your next quarters, you get a better sense of what you're doing or where things are moving around and what you might win. But that's very helpful. Last question I had was with regards to change of can size and some of the things going on in China. That's a new line that you just put in. I think there had been some conversions from T [ph] that were taking place from 3 to 2. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in China? What -- why a new line you're putting in place, you're already making conversion to, what you're seeing?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, we're seeing sort of the same phenomenon. We didn't talk about Europe at even our specialty, what we call non-12-ounce business in Europe, it's up 8% year-to-date. So we're seeing generally a trend from our customers. As they look at their markets, and business is tough out there, they look at new products and new opportunities to expand their markets. And they wanted different sizes, different shapes, different types of things. And even in China where the can is in its infancy, they're still looking at different types of situations for cans. And we want to -- we make sure we give our customers what they need. So you, yes, we -- in China, we've already got our brand new Qingdao line, we're converting to a different size for while. We're going to be on that size for a while, and then we'll convert back to 12 ounce. We put enough flexibility when we built that plant that we have the ability to convert it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Todd Wenning from Morningstar.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: With the recent fire at your plant in North Wales, do you know yet how that might affect your U.K. supply going into the back of the year?
John A. Hayes: Yes, it's -- this is John. It's -- the short answer is, it's not material. We had a small fire on July 22. There was no injuries. It was just contained in a portion of the facilities. The warehouses wasn't impacted. We expect -- and this happened, I guess, it was on Sunday, I guess, it was. We expect 2 of the 4 lines to be up and running by the end of this week. And then a third line running in the very near future, and then the fourth line, it's too early to tell, but probably a couple of weeks out beyond that. So, not a material impact.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, well, that's good news. Could you give us an update on your volume expectations for the punch top cans going into the back half?
John A. Hayes: Yes. For those who don't know, the punch top cans, I think, you're referring to is in one of our beer customers. And they've had a lot of good success with that. It's always tough to tell the incremental growth because you don't know what it would have been and without it. But what we've been hearing from our customers is that that's been actually helping the overall brand for them. And they have seen a lift in cans with that package relative to their glass containers. So that's probably all I should say right now. But it's a good example of how innovation can add growth into a category that historically has not been as strong.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then finally, how much of the North America specialty can volume gains came from craft beer versus other beverage types?
John A. Hayes: Difficult to tell. I don't have it in front of me but from a product...
Raymond J. Seabrook: With several energy drinks, we're growing quite strong. We got 16-ounce energy drinks, 24-ounce energy drinks. But I don't have that number either. But it's - - all those specialty can segments are -- continued to show a lot of promise.
John A. Hayes: Yes, and it's not isolated into the one size either. We had good growth in the smaller sizes, good growth into the larger sizes, good growth in Alumi-Tek. So it really is spread across the board.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: John, you mentioned that one of your key near-term priorities in the beverage can market is to get pricing a little bit stronger relative to costs and can you just give us a little more color on the geographies where that needs to be done sort of more than others where it doesn't need to be as much of a focus?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think my comments were related more to Europe than anywhere else. And we've been talking about a little bit of price cost compression. It isn't wholesale, but it's not where we want to be. And so what we're focused on is we can add capacity. Typically, when we do that, it's on the tail-end of a customer contract. You all know how we do that. But we're more focused on a relative sense of getting pricing to where we think it ought to be and getting back to where it was as opposed to adding capacity into a market that has been over-served and has been a bit soft. So that's particularly to Europe. I think generally speaking, the overall economy is putting pricing pressure on many, many different industries, and our industries are not any different. We've been able to weather much of that because we focus on what we do best, which is getting more for less and being very efficient with not only our capital, but our labor and things like that. We continue to have a lot of initiatives over in Asia, here in North America, down in South America and over in Europe to make sure we're focused on that. And we're seeing a lot of good opportunities that our folks in the plants do a great job at making sure that we're doing that day in and day out. And so we're going to continue to focus on that but with particular emphasis on the European side.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. And then I know Ray was talking about the -- using some of the equipment that you might not -- no longer needed in North America, overseas, and just sort of 2 tangents to that. One, I would assume that you cannot effectively use some of the older standard can equipment in making specialty, and that's why you would do that. And secondly, can you give us an idea of the timing? It would seem like this could be stretched out really more into, say, '14 or '15 as opposed to '13 when we could actually see equipment moving. Is that a fair assumption?
Raymond J. Seabrook: As I said, in the next probably 60 days, we'll finalize these plans once we see all these other near-term opportunities sort out. So we will sort that out. We will -- obviously, not all of the equipment is usable, as you just mentioned, but a lot of it is. And we've got a pretty good idea where it goes now, but we will fine-tune that. And by the end of the year, we'll know where it's going. Now it may not be all bolted down and installed right away, but we know basically what -- probably what markets and what we're going to be doing with it.
John A. Hayes: And as Ray -- to follow-up on that as well, there's 2 binary things here. It's one, about the capacity curtailment, permanent curtailment, but then the other thing is about where to put that. And that's dependent upon market growth. And so we're not just going to automatically put it in somewhere just to say we have it in there. I think Ray's point is from a capital avoidance, as we go forward, as new projects come onstream, we have that used equipment at our disposal, which should help drive down some of our CapEx as we go forward.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. And you might have answered this, but just to be clear, you gave us the breakdown between the U.S. volume changes, specialty versus standards, and I'm guessing that standard was down around 5%. So you might clarify that? What was the breakdown in Europe? Overall, you said it was up mid-single digits. How would you break that down between specialty and the standard cans?
John A. Hayes: Well, Ray, I think, mentioned that specialty was up 8%, and we were up just low-single digits. So that would imply that standard was down just a little bit.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We now have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just want to come back first to a comment that was made on the outlook. Now from your press release, I think you said that the second half you hope to be able to do as well as in the first half, if I remember correctly and --
Raymond J. Seabrook: That was for food can? What segment?
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: No, I think that was in total in earnings per share. So I was just trying to basically take the conclusion one would draw from that, Ray, with your comment that you would hope to be at both, maybe at the low end of your earnings growth target that you have annually, which is 10% to 15%. Because taking a second half that's a little bit better than your first half, if I'm not mistaken, would get you into your range?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, the 10% comment I made is, I think, I was just talking about the Asia and North America segment. Someone had asked me -- I think earlier, we said we still think we could potentially grow that 10% to 15%. I think that's going to be difficult. I think we've got a shot at the bottom into that range, but we're going to get close to it, close to the bottom end of that range.
John A. Hayes: Yes. And I think, George, what's implied there, we expect, as we sit here today, to do a little bit better in the second half than we did in the first half.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, we'll keep that in mind as well. Secondly, same vein of question, when you were talking about the business shifting within the Americas beverage can business, you ultimately mentioned that you didn't think it was significant, and that it would ultimately not be -- I forgot what your phrasing was, but I'll say significant again -- wouldn't be significant relative to your overall Drive for 10 goals, which again includes a 10% to 15% EPS growth. At this juncture, given what -- and I realize some things can change and obviously, you don't control the economy or the weather. Is it your view that next year, you would not be able to hit your 10% to 15% range, or you think you shall be able to do that even with this dent on the volume front?
John A. Hayes: Well, it's -- how I'd describe it is, number one, we haven't changed our view short-term or long-term, point one. Point two, it is too early to tell because there's many things outside of our control. But we have good plans in place, not only in our North American metal beverage business, but in all of our businesses over the next 18 months and beyond. And number three, based upon all of that, as we get into 2013, we expect to do as well as we possibly can, and we're not changing what our long-term goals are.
Operator: There are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay, terrific. Well, thanks, everyone, for participating. As a heads up, our third quarter earnings conference call will be held on October 25, and it's going to be a little bit earlier. It's going to be at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. And so everyone, have a good rest this summer. Have a good third quarter, and we will look forward to talking to you then. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.
John A. Hayes: Thank you, France, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2012 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO Global Packaging.  In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow with details about our Packaging operating performance, and I will close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for the remainder of 2012. Ball reported improved comparable first quarter 2012 results during the seasonally slow first quarter. Recall that we have mentioned in January that our first half of the year will be relatively flat as compared to 2011, and we performed slightly better than we expected. Maximizing the value and performance of our existing businesses is one of the strategic levers of our Drive for 10 strategy, and our people and our business are executing well in this environment.  The other levers of Drive for 10 include broadening our geographic reach, expanding in the new products and capabilities, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets, and leveraging our technology expertise to create a competitive advantage. We're making good progress in all of these. And several highlights include: completing the construction of our previously announced capital projects in Qingdao, China; Alagoinhas, Brazil; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, further broadening our geographic reach; increasing the production and sales of our specialty can product portfolio in North America, which grew approximately 20% due to expanding volume in the 7.5 ounce, 16 ounce in Alumi-Tek product categories; leveraging our technological expertise by announcing our ReAl can technology and innovation and sustainability breakthrough in our extruded aluminum impacting business. ReAl enables significant light weighting of aluminum aerosol container, while utilizing aluminum from our beverage can plants in the manufacturing process to add up to 25% recycled content into aluminum aerosol containers.  And finally, we've been working hard on our third sustainability report, which will be out at the end of May. Sustainability is an important part of our Drive for 10 and plays a key role in both maximizing the value our existing businesses and leveraging our technology. Our new report will provide detail on our progress since 2010 as well as our future goals and objectives. You'll hear more examples of our Drive for 10 progress from Scott and Ray. There's a lot going on here at Ball. And while it's still early in the year, 2012 is off to a nice start.  I'll turn it over to Scott, and we'll talk about the quarter. And then the Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for 2012. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 were $0.63 versus last year's $0.58, an increase of nearly 9%.  For the first quarter, the following factors contributed to these results: higher European and specialty can volumes; solid program performance in our Aerospace business; a lower share count; and a lower tax rate.  For a complete summary of the first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. The key financial metrics for 2012 that I gave you in January are all the same other than the tax rate. Taking into account certain tax benefits achieved in the first quarter and those expected later in the year, the full year effective tax rate will now be approximately 30% for the full year 2012. Other than that one change, everything else looks the same.  Interest expense will remain at approximately $175 million. Full year 2012 CapEx is still expected to be in the range of $400 million. And as always, the timing of future projects will impact actual spending, so we'll keep you updated as the year progresses. And we still expect 2012 free cash flow in the range of $450 million.  The company's annual funding of our U.S. pension plan was largely completed in the first quarter. And at current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $3 billion, roughly flat versus 2011 as we will continue to return our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown.  With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the Packaging operations.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Comparable operating earnings through the first quarter in the Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment were below last year's level. For the most part, the first quarter earnings shortfall was in Brazil.  First quarter sales volumes in Brazil were lower by mid-single digits compared to a year ago, primarily due to a change in the customer filling location and the temporary loss of another location due to higher freight cost until our new capacity came on stream. The new can plant, Alagoinhas, has successfully started making cans in late March and is now supplying our customers in the Northeast, which will catch up our volumes in the second quarter.  With this new capacity coming on stream, we anticipate full year Brazil volumes to be up 15% or more from 2011 levels.  In Asia, our new joint venture can plant in Vietnam also started up in March, and we are now selling cans to our customers in that marketplace. The newly constructed plant in Qingdao, China is still in checkout phase and is scheduled to making and selling cans to our customers next month.  All in all, it's been a very busy first quarter finishing up these major capital projects. Sales volumes in China were also off to a slow start due to a very cold winter in the north and an earlier-than-normal beginning to the Chinese New Year. First quarter Asia results were a little behind last year's level, but we still expect low double-digit volume growth in Asia for the full year.  First quarter sales volumes in North America were up slightly compared to a year ago. And we started to see a more favorable sales mix as we got to the end of the quarter that has carried into the second quarter.  Higher archive and freight cost occurred in the first quarter as we move to improve plant utilization rates. Comparable European operating results were slightly better than a year ago despite currency headwinds and continued price cost compression in beverage cans.  Beverage can volumes were up mid-single digits and aerosol volumes were up low-double digits in the quarter. Ball Aerocan continues to make year-over-year earnings improvements.  First quarter earnings in the U.S. Metal Food and Household Products segment were ahead of plan, but below last year's first quarter due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. Food can volumes in the quarter were slightly below last year's level, but our total year forecast is for improved volumes due to relatively easy comps from a year ago.  As we said in our January conference call, the quarterly earning pattern in this business in 2012 will return to a more typical seasonal pattern, which was reversed in 2011. A more typical quarterly earnings pattern would be for 40% of segment earnings we made in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. As we look to a full year earnings for this business, we continue to see another strong year.  With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Great. Thanks, Ray. Aerospace and Technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margin for the quarter. Backlog ended the quarter at $855 million, which is holding in nicely as we await for it on key bids outstanding. Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up, and we anticipate another good year in Aerospace despite the uncertainty around funding in this election year.  Now during the quarter, Ball's Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite instrument onboard the NPP satellite began collecting data that will provide information about the global distribution of ozone. And in early April, NASA extended the Kepler mission to 2016. Kepler was designed to search for planets around other stars and has identified so far more than 60 confirmed planets and hundreds of other planet candidates. Ball Aerospace is the mission prime contractor for Kepler.  Finally, we also announced the addition of Rob Strain as Chief Operating Officer of Ball Aerospace. Rob comes to us from NASA, where he was the Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center and has a wealth of experience in the civil, defense and commercial aerospace markets. And we're delighted to have him on board as he works closely with Dave Taylor and the rest of our Aerospace team in the pursuit of Our Drive for 10 strategies.  So in summary, and as we said in January, we expect our first half of the year to be largely flat as compared to 2011. And with an improved first quarter behind us, we are slightly ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. We continue to see noticeable upside in the back half of the year as new emerging market plants complete their start-up curves and begin selling product and our North America and European beverage businesses move into the busy summer selling season.  As Scott mentioned, Ball will continue to generate significant free cash flow, and we remain focused on a disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders and grow our company.  Drive for 10 is a mindset around perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goals and more than doubling the EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over that time and more specifically in 2012.  So with that, France, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Ray, I was hoping you could go through the volume percentages or guidance for the first quarter, specifically with the Americas segment for beverage. I couldn't keep up with some of your discussion.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, okay. Sure, George. Brazil, we were down about 6% and the market was up maybe 4.5% to 5%. And I think I explained in our comments that, that's just mainly timing for us. In North America, we were up at pretty much like the market through the quarter. And in China, we were pretty flat, slightly down but pretty flat.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I mean you mentioned the reasons there. I mean given the growth economically still being higher-single digits, were you disappointed even with the weather, even with the late recovery out of the New Year with that volume growth in China?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, I think it surprised us quite frankly. And it wasn't just us. I think it was -- if you were to talk to our competitors in China, they would probably give you the same story. I think the early Chinese New Year probably meant that our sales in the fourth quarter last year were a little stronger than they otherwise might have been because people were taking cans in the fourth quarter. It was terribly cold in the North this year. That's one of the reasons at Qingdao. It should be up and running right by now and it's not. That's one of the reasons. It was hard for us to get some of that concrete forward because it was so cold. But all in all, I talked to our guys just -- I've been talking to our guys constantly. The volume is starting to pick up. As we sit now, the weather's gotten a lot of better. So we are still predicting low double-digit volume increases in China, and we think most of that was just timing.
John A. Hayes: George, also, this is John, let's not forget that in 2011, we were sold out, so we did not have any additional capacity. And so we're anticipating the ramp up of Qingdao to provide us that flexed capacities going forward. So now that we have it, our salespeople have had discussions with our customers, which is not unimportant as we think about going to the second half of 2012.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Actually, that's a good point, John. We actually, in our plan this year, we felt we'd actually have to buy cans for China. And as we know, because of the little slower start, I'm not sure we're going to have to do that. And, of course, if we buy cans, we don't make any money. So I think really we're looking at that as just primarily timing.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And related question, not trying to overdo it. Given that there was some one-off factor that created these slower start both in Brazil and China, would this be a reason that perhaps you take a more wait-and-see approach on the next slug of capacity to see how the market digested or not really? You're still, more or less, all guns blazing relative to [indiscernible] we have in place?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, remember, George, we just -- we really don't -- we don't build the plant and hope somebody shows up. That's not how we do things.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Understood.
Raymond J. Seabrook: So we really don't do anything unless we have customer contracts in hand. So if we have customer contract in hand that has the right parts to them that says that we're not taking all the risk, then in fact, we put capacity in. So that's the way we operate, and we'll continue to do that. So we're really not building anything we don't have contracts for. So that's how we're going to continue in the future. We have slowed down a little bit because the market slowed down a little bit, but we -- that's always the way we do things.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Fair point. Last question then I'll turn it over. One, have you seen any kind of pickup in promotional activity or interest in North America on the beverage side? Two, what are your plans with the lines that have been idle in Columbus? And three, are you seeing any more competition in the aluminum bottle market vis-à-vis you're Alumi-Tek technology?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Let's see. The first question is we are seeing some promotional activity. We have some lines idled in Columbus. We just had some discussions yesterday. We may have to turn some of those lines on. We are to the walls in every single one of our plants in the U.S., absolutely to the walls, except we bottled [ph] those 2 lines in Columbus. And I'm not sure we're not going to have to lease term one of them on before we get to the end of the year, especially if the market picks up a little bit for sure. We're not seeing any competition for Alumi-Tek. As a matter of fact, in our R&D shop, we continue to look at various things. And I'm pretty excited with some of the R&D things that we're developing that relate to that, not exactly Alumi-Tek but Alumi-Tek type technology. So we're really doing some really good things over there that I think is going to pay dividends for us in the future.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you might have mentioned on the last call that you could possibly see Metal Beverage America, Asia operating profit up 15% year-over-year. But 1Q operating profit, it looks like it was down. Do you still think you can get that kind of result? And what has to happen from here on out to potentially get there?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, yes. We definitely foresee that segment operating profit up. I just don't have the number in front of me, but it's 15%, but we see it significantly up. The first quarter was pretty much as we thought. Remember, Brazil last year -- if we think about Brazil's comps, last year, Brazil, our volume increased 18% in the first quarter. It was down 18% in the second, and so we're flat halfway during the year. And I think we were up double digits by the time we got to the end of the year. This year, our volume was up. I mean it was off 6%. The market was up, but we expect with our new capacity coming in Brazil that volumes will be up at least 15% year-over-year. So we're expecting volumes up in China. We're expecting them up in Brazil. And so far, the U.S. has started up fairly strong. So we expect that segment profit up certainly more than 10%, somewhere between 10% and 15%, I would tell you.
John A. Hayes: To reiterate what Ray said. We -- nothing really -- the first quarter came in as we thought, and we see nothing as we go forward that's a deviation from what we thought in January.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And do you get a little bit of a mix shift there in that it looks like Brazil volumes or top line growth you might have taken that up a little bit, and China is maybe a little bit lower? Do you get a positive mix shift with better volumes out of Brazil and maybe a little bit weaker in China?
John A. Hayes: Nothing appreciable. I think as we look at the various areas within that segment: Asia, Brazil and North America; you always get little bit shifts here and there, but I wouldn't -- from a profitability point of view, it's nothing appreciable.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Ray, on the promotional activity commentary, can you differentiate between beer and CSD in North America? Is it sort of equally spread between the 2 or is one stronger than the other?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I think what we're seeing a little stronger. We're hearing it a little stronger in the CSD side.
John A. Hayes: Yes. And we said that on the beer side, the overall beer market in the first quarter was actually up slightly. And that's after a couple of straight being down in the low-single digits. And what -- our beer customers are making a lot of renewed noise and push around the marketing innovation, which not only is helpful to growing the category, but it's helpful for us because it's key to our strategy.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then switching to Brazil. Obviously, the market slowed. I don't know how it shaped up inter-quarter, but did you have any sort of down time to realign inventories with what you started to see in terms of deterioration there?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, absolutely. We took downtime in our plants. We didn't build inventory.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Can you sort of quantify that for us?
Raymond J. Seabrook: As I say, a 6% reduction in the quarter is like a 50 million cans. And we took downtime to cover that off.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then just real quick on the extruded aluminum pack in Europe, what's behind the double-digit increase there?
John A. Hayes: Continued customer demand. Despite some of the economic ills in Europe, we're continuing to see strong demand. And we're, I think, we're aligned with the right customers.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just piggybacking off of Ghansham's question. Margins actually held up pretty well in Europe. Certainly volumes were strong. But price was supposed to be down a little bit. Is the margin strength driven by the Aerosol side?
Raymond J. Seabrook: We did get -- we have had price cost compression in Europe, there's no question about it, mainly in beverage only.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So it sounds like the lift came from the aluminum Aerosol business, right?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. That and also the volume increase.
John A. Hayes: And our guys have been doing a good job over in Europe controlling the cost relative to the price compression.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then when you're looking at acquisitions going forward, are you looking to stay in your core products that you're in already? Are there opportunities for you to expand in something different, like a few years ago, you guys branched out into aluminum slugs in the Aerosol business?
John A. Hayes: That acquisition was a very much adjacent to what we were doing. And when you think about selling aluminum containers and the slugs were a key component of it, I would not expect us to go far afield certainly. We have more opportunities in what we do today than we've seen in a while. And so we're going to stick to our knitting, generally speaking. Technology is an important part of what we do. I think the slug business is a good example of that in our announcement of the first quarter about taking our scrap from our beverage can plants and putting it into the slugs was exactly what we had anticipated as we acquired that. And so things like that, I don't think, are too far afield. But as we sit here today, as I mentioned, we have a lot of opportunities within what we know very well.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And just a last question for Scott. It's early in the year. Your free cash flow was a little bit light, and I think you guys guide towards working cap being flat potentially. What's driving the uptick in that working cap?
Scott C. Morrison: When we think of working cap -- actually, we made significant improvements in the working cap last year. We've got a number of programs in place this year that we think we can actually improve upon where we ended up last year. It's early in the year, but we think we can have a bit of a source of funds from working capital this year as well.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on the guidance for Americas, Asia beverage of up 10% to 15% this year, I just want to kind of peel back a little bit and understand how much of that you think would come from North America versus emerging markets? I'm trying to basically take into account the North America. You have the switch over to specialty. You have the Torrance closure that still have some savings. So is it kind of 50-50 emerging markets versus developed? Or how do you think about that?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I don't have that in front of me, but I think that's reasonable. But I don't think we'd get much. Torrance closed in the fourth quarter of '10, I think. Was it fourth quarter? Yes. So we've taken -- a lot of that has come. We're already in 2012. So a lot of that's come. Some of that Torrance equipment is sitting in Vietnam and other places, so we got some nice benefits from doing that, but I would say it's in the neighborhood of 50-50.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just in the current quarter, the 10 million decline, was that -- was basically all of that in Brazil [indiscernible].
John A. Hayes: Not all of it is Brazil. But by far, the majority of it is Brazil.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just the guidance commentary on the first half being flattish, does that still hold at this stage? Or would you say you're thinking because you've implied 2Q will be down, but it doesn't seem like that should be the case.
John A. Hayes: Yes, no. I think what I said in my prepared remarks is given that we're slightly above in the first quarter, we expect it -- another way of saying it, we'd expect the second quarter to be roughly flat. Because as we said here in January, January, we said the first half would be flat. We are a little bit above after the first quarter, so you would expect that to carry through. But I wouldn't read into it too much for the second quarter.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. And just one other question, how big is your Specialty Can business. You said it's 20% in North America. How big is it overall and in North America?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, in North America, it's about 17% or so. And that -- in Brazil it's probably a little bit higher. In Europe, it's probably about the same. And in Asia, it's a little bit lower. But I think the trends in the emerging markets, we're seeing a shift from 12 ounce or 33 centiliter to more specialty cans accelerating as time goes on.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: This is actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. I just wanted to focus a bit on your outlook in Europe. You mentioned in the press release the pickup in promotional activity there ahead of the summer special events. Any sense of how things are playing out maybe versus your initial expectations? And two, is it safe to say you expect a sequential volume acceleration versus what we saw this quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes. We did get off to a strong start in Europe. Let's take a step back and think about all the drivers as we go forward. We've got the European Cup Championships that are in the 2nd half of June. We've got the Olympics that are in London in July. Recall that last summer from a weather perspective in Europe was dismal. And in fact, the third quarter last year, we had said that we had taken some downtime in August, which was unprecedented for us in our European beverage can plants. And so we don't expect that to happen. The can is continuing to take share. On the CSD market across Europe, generally speaking, it's been relatively flat from a total CSD perspective. But the cans are up mid-single digits, which means they're taking share. And the beer was off a little bit in totality. But cans, we're up upper single digits in terms of filling. So I think another example a lot of it is taking share. So as we look to the going through the balance of the summer and into the second half of the year, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: You mentioned some pricing compression that you're seeing in Europe, can you just talk about when you expect to cycle through that pricing compression? And then as you look to the other parts of the world that you participate in, is there any issues with pricing there to note?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, when we look to Europe, as John talked about, the volume is increasing, so the capacity demand situation is tightening up. So -- and we had a situation where we had some people passing capacity, and we had a little bit of capacity. We are fundamentally sold out pretty much by the end of this year in Europe. And as that capacity tightens up, we would expect pricing to tighten up in Europe. I think in China, there's a little bit more open capacity than we'd like to see. The market is growing double-digit growth. We don't see that slowing down in the near future, and people have added capacity. So we're probably going to cycle what we got with a little bit more capacity China. We'd like to see some -- pricing is more difficult there. As that market grows, that'll tighten up for us. And in North America, we're pretty stable. It's pretty stable. We get -- so I think pricing is -- North America is pretty, as I said, pretty stable.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the volume trend in North America, it seems like it's coming in positive for you. And not just for you, a number of other companies exposed to beverages end market. And it's better than we are expecting. And part of that is we tend to look at some of the end market data as reported by AC Nielsen in the retail channel, which continues to be pretty soft. Can you talk about whether some of that volumes that you guys are seeing in North America if that's driven maybe by some inventory bill that's happening? Or just the benefit of nice weather, which is driving consumption in other channels outside of the retail channel? Do you have any thoughts on that?
John A. Hayes: I really think there's 3 issues ongoing. Number one, the economy in America, while it's not great, it's certainly getting better from a year-over-year perspective. So that's point one. Number two, the weather has been quite favorable in this winter and spring season across the United States. And I think that is helping. And then number three, as we've talked about over the past couple of years, there's been a fair amount of price-taking by our customers at the expense of volume. And as Ray had mentioned earlier, we're seeing and hearing about more increased summer promotional activities. So that bodes well for the can as we move into the summer.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: The first one is on the Aerospace division. Could you update us on your aerospace expansion project? And have you started looking at doing any geosynchronous or telecommunication projects?
John A. Hayes: Well, we are building out and adding capacity, if you will, to our satellite manufacturing facility, and that's well underway. In fact, it should be commissioned probably at the end of this year. It does provide us capability to do some things in addition to what we've historically done on some of the larger buses, which you're referring to in terms of geosynchronous activity. That's an area that we can certainly explore. But I think as we sit here today, we don't really have anything to comment on other than it does provide us the capability to expand into additional markets that, from a manufacturing perspective, we are unable to pursue prior to doing this.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Okay, that helps. Switching gears a bit. Your tax rate was especially low. Can you give us some context around it? And is there any chance we could expect something similar going forward?
Scott C. Morrison: Sure, this is Scott. But we have reserves for a variety of uncertain tax positions. And when we get to the point in an audit process that are positioned with regard to those issues as determined, we can then release those reserves. So that's what occurred in the first quarter. We see a little bit more of that more happening potentially late this year, that's why I said our tax rate for the full year will probably be around 30%.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, as you look out beyond -- looking out beyond 2013 or so, what are the top 2 or 3 markets that you think that you could expand into organically? And by that point, do you think the Brazilian market will be saturated, North and South?
John A. Hayes: Well, we're not going to go into great detail here obviously given the competitive nature of it. But as Ray and we talked about in our prior calls, we think Asia, generally speaking China, in particularly, but Southeast Asia as well, bodes well just because the overall demographics. The retail chain in China is one of the largest in the world right now. It's supposed to double in the top 50 cities of China over the next 10 years. And there's just a lot of built-in improvement from a can share perspective. We've talked about the can as a share of the package mix. And beer for example is only about 6%, yet it's the biggest and fastest-growing beer market in the world. So we continue to see that going well. We've also talked about in Brazil that we have been experiencing strong growth driven by the improved economy and driven by a rise in middle class, driven by the improved overall beverage volumes and can share penetration gains. We're in the upper 30s right now in Brazil. We're also benefiting and we will for the next couple of years because of the infrastructure builds related to the World Cup and the Olympics. But at some point in time, that will moderate out. And so we have been building some capacity in there because we see in the next couple of years some good trends. But that is going to start the level out over time, and that hasn't been lost on us. And then we continue to look at other areas that's probably premature to talk about. But the beverage can, over the past few years, has really taken hold in some of these more emerging markets. And it's actually solidifying in some of the stable markets. I mentioned that the can share penetration growth in Europe, which Ray talked about, the solid performance, at least in the first quarter, which is not a trend necessarily, but we feel pretty constructive about what's happening in North America. So we have solid underpinnings in the mature markets, and we think we have some growth opportunities in some of the places that we already play in.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple follow-up questions if I may. Is there a way to somehow quantify maybe the price compression you're seeing in Europe? Maybe a different way of coming at this is I think earlier in the year, you guys have talked about thinking that volumes might be up only flat to up a couple of points. But you've been in better shape mid-single digits here this quarter. And it sounds like now you're more in line that things might be mid-single digits. And then we're seeing that other business, the Aerosol business over there are doing well, too. So how should we think about total profitability there for the year? And is there a way to somehow help us quantify how much price compression we've been seeing?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, I think -- Chris, this is Ray. I think what I would do is look at the margins in our European business. You'll probably find rough 100, 150 basis points, so that volume's up, the margin's off, and that's the way to quantify it.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. I'll think about contribution into pieces [ph]. The second question I had was with respect to also staying over there in Europe. If by the end of the year you're in a position again where you're sold out, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you would feel regarding adding additional capacity during '13 or specific markets where you think might be reasonable targets that would best support further capacity?
John A. Hayes: A couple of thoughts on the way we think about this. Recall back in January, Ray, I believe, had said that we had actually thought about sometime in 2012 we might need to add capacity, and we put that on hold. And it is going to remain on hold because we're trying to get the profitability where we think it ought to be. We would much rather run full out because this is a fixed cost business and you need to do that. So that's one observation. The other observation, as Ray also talked about, was we don't add capacity unless we have it effectively sold out with customer contracts. And so as our customers are continuing to look at growth with large in Europe because the can share penetration and other things, we're in very close contact with them. But we just don't want to add capacity because the market in the short term has been a little bit higher than our expectations. Now that's not to say we won't, but we'd much rather really focus on what we can control right now, which is the cost side of our business and the volume production side of our business, and then let the demand side dictate what we will do.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last question I had was regarding the extruded aluminum technology. Is that something that was developed out of the JV in Europe? Or is that something that you guys did on your own on the slug side, I'm guessing? And then how does -- or is that transferable here to North America? I think I read in the press release that it was intended to start over there in Europe? And is that something that as you save the metal that you can effectively retain in your own profits? Or how does that work?
John A. Hayes: Well, we first developed it on our own here in North America. And using the technology of beverage can as I mentioned, beverage cans as well as the slug. Because we produce the aluminum bottles and aerosol cans over in Europe, we're going to start manufacturing them then. This is as much about an environmental sustainability play as it is an economic sustainability play. And we think that we've created a real breakthrough. And so we expect to get to be able to keep a fair amount of those savings, while at the same time providing an incentive to our customers to really push this product.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Albert Kabili with Credit Suisse.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess the question on 2013 in North America the contract renegotiations and if you had any sort of early thoughts along those lines, how you...
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, this is Ray. We only have one contract to do, and we are in the process of doing it. So everything else is under contract.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Right, but I guess it's a large contract and so...
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, it's not that large. I mean there's 2 parts to it. So it's not as large as you might think.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. All right, that's helpful. Second question, along the lines of aerosol, if you could -- I may have missed it what your aerosol can volumes did. I was a bit surprised looking at the industry data how weak Aerosol was and what you're hearing along that front.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, tinplate aerosol was down, you're right about that. Our aerosol volumes in North America were down, a little soft in the first quarter. However, they seem to pop back up at least at the start of the second quarter. Food was just down a little bit. When I look at the aerosol volumes in Europe, we talked about it, it was up low-single digits.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then North America, should we be concerned or are you seeing any shift to aluminum away from tinplate? I mean that would obviously benefit you in Europe. But as we look about North America on aerosol, is there anything headwind on a package mix shift to aluminum away from aerosol that noticeably have impacted you thus far?
John A. Hayes: Nothing appreciably. You have to -- tinplate has its home in terms of insecticides and household products. And the aluminum has captured a fair amount of the growth because that's in the beauty and personal care. So everything from suntan lotions that are now going into aluminum and have extruded when they used to be in plastic tubes and other things like that. But there really hasn't been a shift because each -- both tinplate on one hand and aluminum on the other hand have natural submarkets relative to the overall Aerosol category.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then final question on the Aerospace. The backlog was down a little sequentially. How do you see that playing out the rest of the year here? What are some of the next big projects, if there's any, on the radar screen that we should be looking out for?
John A. Hayes: We have a number of bids outstanding right now. And probably, candidly, more bids than I recall in the recent past. And that's the good news. One of the problem is we have a government right now that's in an election year. And so the ability to make decisions is quite -- is a bit uncertain. We have a lot of the economic issues about sequestration happening at the end of the year and tax cuts expiration, as well as debt ceiling. And so I think their focus is more on that, what to do with it. I will say this, in terms of some of the things we've been bidding on, it's -- we expect those things to continue as we go forward because as all of you know that what we do in the Aerospace side, those things are of national importance to what we do as a nation. And so we feel pretty good. We always talk about it being a little bit lumpy, and backlog is no different. We're down $40 million or $50 million from the year end. It's too early to predict exactly what it will be like in each quarter as we go forward, but as I said we have an awful lot of bids outstanding.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And along those lines, John, is there any way to maybe help us quantify, like in aggregate how big that bidding activity is in total size, like if it were 100%, which I know it never is? But is there a way for us to gauge just how big that is? You mentioned that it's healthy.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Let's put it this way. When we talk about backlog, it's funded backlog. And so that is what has already been funded by the U.S. government. We have a lot of unfunded backlog. And rough order of magnitude, it's usually twice the funded backlog is that is out there. And then on top of that, we have bids outstanding, and it's usually much greater than the funded backlog. So at any given time, we have well in excess of what our funded backlog is, well in excess in terms of things that we've won but have not booked or things -- bids that we have outstanding. And the trajectory of those types of things that I'm talking about, as I said, has gotten a little better for us, not worse.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question, from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.
Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just wondering. Can you guys talk about your trends in Germany for the quarter?
John A. Hayes: Yes. Well, the overall German market was up about 17%. We were up a little bit more than that just because we're quite large in that area. The good news is the beer is actually stronger. The beer was up 24%, 25% beer cans. And that is really a sweet spot we think over the long term for the German market. So obviously, it was -- first quarter is a seasonally slow quarter, but the trends that we have seen in Germany really haven't changed. We're still hoping and waiting that some of the 2 largest chains, retail chains in Germany start to lift. They haven't done that yet, but there's a variety of discussions going on with them. But where the can has been listed, the penetration rates have been equal to or a little bit better than what we had been hoping.
Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And also in Europe, I was just wondering are you guys seeing a bifurcation in pricing trends versus specialty versus standard cans. I assume that standard can is under a little bit more pricing pressure, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
John A. Hayes: Well, actually, what we have seen is actually a little bit more of our customers' gravitation towards more of the standard sizes. As we talked about earlier, the European economy is tough, and so there's a lot of -- not only for us, but a lot of just industry generally are focused on value and are focused on cost and those things. And so we see the slight trending down from some of the higher-end specialty packages to more commodity packages. But to answer the question about pressured trends from a pricing relative to commodity versus standard containers, we don't think, see any appreciable difference there.
Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I was also curious in China. There's a lot of capacity coming on. And I'm wondering, is there a risk in the near term that some of this new capacity does what happens [ph] you guys done in Brazil where you lost a bit of volume given your location or approximately to your customers. And the other thing that I've been finding surprising is just some announcements about the self manufacturing. For some of these players, I would think that, that would be something that we wouldn't be moving towards at this point in the market.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, this is Ray. As I said, we're sold out in 2012 in China. So I've said that on the one hand. The other hand I can tell you that we've lost business. We've had some business with some customers, and we have lost on price. And so we're trying to do -- we're trying to weight the equation such that we have to be competitive, obviously. We're trying to weight the equation such that we pick the business and we look at the long-term potential of this business. But we certainly are getting competition in China, and we have lost business. However, we still remain sold out. So obviously, we continue to grow. The market continues to grow. So that's an equation that we spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. And we try to get it right.
John A. Hayes: I might add also that you talked about self manufacturers. There's some independent can manufacturers, is the way I'd describe it. And one of the things that we've been spending an awful lot of time is bringing the experience and expertise that we have in the North American markets that we have in the European markets from a cost, from a technology, from an efficiency, from a know-how perspective and making sure that we are leveraging it as much as possible in Asia and China in particular. Because at the end of the day in our business, low cost always wins. And we do think we have competitive advantages. We believe our cost structure is better than most, if not all, the competition over in Asia. And we're putting a renewed focus to make sure we're as efficient as possible there because that's the way you win in a game like that.
Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just last question in China. What is your mix between beer, CSD? And do you see that mix changing going forward?
John A. Hayes: The Chinese palate is different. So obviously, they like the teas. Our mix is much more heavily weighted towards beer and tea than it is to soft drink. It's probably reversed to the U.S.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Of the long-term growth you're expecting in China and Brazil, how much do you expect to come from beer market growth and how much do you expect to come from a shift from bottles to cans?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think it's a combination of both. And it varies by market. As I said, in Brazil, from a can penetration perspective on the beer side, we're in the upper 30s. And we think there's a little bit more runway there, but not a tremendous amount of runway. But the overall beer category has been growing 4%, 5%. So over the past few years, we've been getting a double whammy relative to the growth there. That's going to start to moderate out. I think in China, it's a bit different. We come from a very low level of can share penetration. As we said before, it's about 6%. China is the fastest-growing beer market in the world from an overall literage [ph] perspective. And I think those 2 issues alone create an algorithmic trajectory. Just to give you another data point that helps support that, I know in Vietnam, 3, 4 years ago, the can had a share of the beer market of around 16%, 17%. And now it's in the mid-20s, 24%, 25%, so that's just another proof point of some of the things that we are seeing over there.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What would you say is the biggest risk to the long-term growth and profit expectations you have for those 2 markets other than just GDP growth slowing?
John A. Hayes: Well, I think in Brazil, as we talked about, they're benefiting as an economy right now in the rise of the middle class. And I think to answer your question, that's it, the rise of the middle class. In Brazil, because the infrastructure around the Olympics, around the World Cup, I think for the next couple of years, we can clearly see and have good visibility into the continued rise of the incomes of the middle class. In China, I think it's a foregoing conclusion as well. They have spent the last 3 years or so really putting emphasis on the consumer side of the business and going from an export market on the industrial side to an internal consumption. And so when you have all those people move, migrating from the rural areas to the urban areas, I think it just continues to bode well. But it is an element that when there is a rise in the middle class, our products always do well. And candidly, I think over the last 3, 4 years in North America, the reason why we're seeing softness in the overall categories of beverages as well as the can is because the middle class hasn't been increasing. It's been decreasing.
Operator: Our next question, from the line of Andy Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.
Andrew Feinman: Can you tell me -- I know the press release has the weighted average number of shares during the quarter, but can you give me the numbers you have at the end of the quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, it was 156,497,000, Andy, basic.
Andrew Feinman: Okay. And you said you made your annual pension contribution during the first quarter. So can you say how much it was?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, I think it was like $85 million -- $95 million in the first quarter, which was the vast majority of what we have to fund this year. And the incremental increase was almost all in the first quarter.
Andrew Feinman: So for some reason I thought it was going to be $135 million. Does $95 million include the pace you go through stuff also or does that just include catch up?
Scott C. Morrison: No, the incremental. So right, the full year is still $135 million. But usually, a chunk of that is spread throughout the year. The big piece of it was done in the first quarter. So $95 million of the $135 million is done.
Andrew Feinman: Okay. And then the last question that I had was last year, your corporate overhead was I think $71.5 million.
Scott C. Morrison: Correct.
Andrew Feinman: I expected that they would be down this year, I don't know why. But in the first quarter, it was up a little. So the question is whether that number is likely to be lower this year or the same or up?
Scott C. Morrison: We're still having the same range that -- the first quarter, we had a huge run up in the stock price. And although we're hedging a good chunk of the stock price impact from various benefit plan, we're still a little bit -- it's not hedged, and so that cost us a few million dollars more in the first quarter than what we are expecting. So it's a little bit higher than what we thought in the first quarter. So around that range last year is still the number that we are expecting for full year.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have 2 last questions. Back to the question of Aerospace, John, could you maybe articulate what few projects -- let me say it differently. If things go as you expect, how many products do you expect to be awarded by the end of this year? Is it possible to predict that at all? And then the second question, totally unrelated. In aluminum bottle, I thought one of your competitors was perhaps adding some capacity. Do you not view that as a competitive threat down the road in terms of specialty cans and special aluminum packaging?
John A. Hayes: Yes, George, this is John. As you know, it's difficult to answer your question, but I'll try the best I can. At any given time, we have over 300 bids from very big to very small, and it varies by business. Some of the bigger ones that we have outstanding, we really can't talk about because they're in a classified world, but they do fit in the sweet spot of what was the progress we've been making over the past number of years in that. We have a variety of other things candidly that have been slipping to the right a little bit because of these funding issues. They are usually more on the smaller side and more on the tactical side, whether it's antennas for the joint strike fighter or other things as that. Ramp up of that new program doesn't go as quickly because of funding and because of other issues. But I think overall, as was mentioned before, the overall amount of bids we see stronger today than it's been in the past. And the only question mark in our mind is how quickly can the U.S. government and how quickly does the U.S. government need to move on some of these things when you have a bifurcated Congress, you have an election of not only the Senate, the Congress, as well as the presidency. And it's just I don't want to predict when people will make decisions in an uncertain environment like that.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And on beer cans? Beer bottles?
Raymond J. Seabrook: The person that's putting that capacity has not had access to our technology, so it's a self-make proposition for them. So I'm not really worried about it.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And you feel fairly comfortable about Alumi-Tek's cost position versus other technologies at this juncture? And if so, why?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, because we've been doing it for a while, and it's not easy to do. And if we've learned a lot of stuff, we've been doing that for 2 or 3 years, you'd be surprised what you can learn in 2 or 3 years. And we've a lot of learned a lot of things, George. And we make it at a lot lower cost now than we did when we first started making it. We've improved the technology. I'd said before, we got some stuff in the R&D -- in our R&D pipeline that looks really, really encouraging to us. So we're just -- we just have a big lead. Eventually they'll figure it out, probably but it's taken us a while.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Do you see Alumi-Tek taking share from mainstream glass in beer markets? Or really is the price gap such that it's still going to be more of an event or a specialty package?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I think it's a combination of both. What you are seeing, you certainly see it in the venue, event venues. So that is quite a positive. But you're also seeing an awful lot in the convenience stores. And that is quite honestly targeted towards some of the more premium and that really is glass. And you're able to buy 9 packs now and some other things like that. Our customer who's using it is promoting it an awful lot, not only marketing but also advertisement, television advertisement, radio advertisement, billboard, and so they're quite bullish on it, and we're here to support them.
Operator: Mr. Hayes, I'll return the call back to you, sir. There are no further questions at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay. Well, we appreciate the participation of you all, and let's look forward to a good second quarter and the balance of the year. And we'll talk to you in July. So thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and kindly ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sema. This Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO of Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter and for 2011. Ray will follow up with details about our Packaging operating performance, and I'll close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for 2012 and beyond. Ball reported improved 2011 results in a continued anemic economic environment. Our solid performance was due largely to the great work from our employees around the world, as well as the development and initial implementation of our Drive for 10 vision. Now at its core, our Drive for 10 vision is made up of 5 strategic levers that we believe will position us for continued growth. These levers include maximizing value from our existing businesses, expanding into new products and capabilities, broadening our geographic reach, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets and finally, leveraging our technological expertise. We've been hard at work executing our strategy, and during the fourth quarter, we maximized value in our existing businesses by ensuring our supply-demand balance aligned with market needs, taking manufacturing downtime in food and beverage plants, resulting in excellent cash flow generation. We expanded into new products to meet growing demand by successfully starting up our new reclosable Alumi-Tek bottle line in Golden, Colorado. We also aligned ourselves with the right customers and markets. In December, Ball Corporation signed a 10-year contract extension with MillerCoors LLC for the Rocky Mountain Metal Container joint venture and extended its commercial supply agreement with MillerCoors LLC as its sole supplier of cans. We continue to expand our geographic reach as construction proceeded on schedule for new beverage can plants in China, Brazil and Vietnam, all of which will start up by the end of the first quarter. And we leveraged our technological expertise with the successful launch of the Ball-built NPP satellite for NASA, which will aid long-term climate forecasts and improve short-term weather forecasts. 2011 was a very good year for Ball. In recognition of the company's performance and future growth potential, our Board of Directors yesterday approved an increase in the dividend of nearly 43% and a new share repurchase authorization of up to 30 million shares. I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return on comments on Aerospace and the outlook for 2012. Scott?
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2011 were $2.73 versus last year's $2.36, an increase of more than 15%. In the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings were $0.48 versus last year's $0.53, which included a tax benefit of $0.07 related to debt refinancing. For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: volume improvements in Brazil and China, strong operating performance at our Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business and a lower share count. Fourth quarter results were impacted by 6 fewer accounting days in the quarter compared to 2010 and our decision to run for cash as Packaging volumes were weaker than forecast in the U.S. and Europe. Turning to full year free cash flow, Ball generated over $500 million after spending nearly $250 million for growth capital. During 2011, we returned every free cash flow dollar to shareholders via a net share buyback of $474 million and dividends of $46 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3 billion, only a $317 million increase over 2010 despite our Aerocan acquisition, growth capital and acquiring over $470 million of our stock. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid with a 2011 comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 4.9x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Turning to some key financial metrics for 2012. Interest expense will remain the same or approximately $175 million. For 2012, full year effective tax rate should be in the range of 31%. As mentioned in today's earnings release, we announced plans to move our European headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in the second half of 2012. Given continuing capital projects in China and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil, full year 2012 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Each of these growth projects exceeds our investment hurdle within 3 years. The timing of certain projects will impact actual spending, and as always, we'll keep you updated as the year progresses. We expect 2012 free cash flow to be in the range of $450 million, with the majority of free cash flow going to share repurchases. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion, roughly flat with 2011, and we'll continue to have cash being oriented to share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown. Finally, here are a few key modeling data points. D&A will run approximately $312 million for the year. Since we did an exceptional job of getting working capital out of the business in 2011, we'll do our best to keep it out in 2012. Pension expense will increase by about $5 million, while cash contributions to the pension plan worldwide will be up approximately $85 million over 2011 levels. Maintenance CapEx, including recent acquisitions, now runs approximately $200 million. On December 31, 2011, basic share count was 160,316,000. Also, let's close the loop on the question of how many accounting days in the quarter is for 2012. We essentially return to a normal quarterly distribution even with the leap year. First quarter 2012 will have 92 days versus 93 days in the first quarter of 2011. The middle quarters will have 91 days as they did in 2011, and the fourth quarter will have 92 days in 2012 versus 90 in 2011. With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the Packaging operations.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Fourth quarter operating results in the Metal Beverage, Americas and Asia segment were better than a year ago due to higher sales volumes and earnings in China and Brazil. Fourth quarter North American Beverage Can earnings were slightly lower than last year due to 2% lower sales volumes as a result of fewer accounting days in the quarter, as Scott noted earlier. Full year operating earnings in this segment were up 15%, and we expect this trend to continue in 2012. In 2012, we anticipate that the Beverage Can market will continue to grow in Brazil and Asia, and specialty can sales will progress in North America. As John mentioned, new manufacturing facilities constructed in '11 in Vietnam, China and Brazil will all be selling cans by the end of the first quarter this year. Further Beverage Can capital expansion programs are planned for China in 2012, but this year's capital spending in Brazil and North America will be considerably reduced from last year's levels. Fourth quarter operating results in Europe were slightly down from a year ago despite Beverage Can volumes being up 2% in the quarter and for the full year. European fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by price cost compression in beverage cans. Full year operating earnings in this segment were up 15%, primarily on the strength of Ball Aerocan acquisition, which occurred in January of 2011. Ball Aerocan continues to perform at better-than-expected levels, with full year sales volumes in '11 up almost 20% from a year ago. Full year operating results in the U.S. Metal Food and Household Products segment were up 3.5% from last year. Fourth quarter earnings were lower than a year ago due to lower sales volumes and inventory management. A poor vegetable pack and little 2012 prebuy impacted fourth quarter sales volume. Full year food can sales volumes were lower by 3% but were down 7% in the fourth quarter. Lower fourth quarter sales volumes drove higher manufacturing costs due to production curtailments. Production curtailments and better inventory management resulted in Food and Household business reducing working capital by more than $80 million in 2011. As we look to 2012, we anticipate another good year in this segment, but quarterly earnings distribution will be much different. In 2011, this segment earned 60% of its full year earnings in the first half and 40% in the second half of the year. In 2012, the full year earnings distribution will be reversed. With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks, Ray, and thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace and Technologies business posted double-digit EBIT margins for the full year. Continued excellent program performance propelled this segment's results to record levels. NASA's NPP satellite launched successfully on October 28, and instruments are coming online and returning good data. Climate monitoring and measurement is an important growth area for us and is the latest example. Also during the quarter, Ball Aerospace was awarded contracts to develop and integrate enhanced operational capabilities for the U.S. Air Force Distributed Common Ground System, providing new capabilities for the intelligent community, another growth area for Ball. Backlog ended the year at $897 million, which sets us up well going into 2012. Though the top line will grow in 2012, EBIT will likely be relatively flat with 2011 as multiyear fixed-price programs ramp up through the year. So in summary, our various businesses had a solid finish to 2011, and we expect to do even better in 2012. Due largely to the lack of inventory holding gains, as Scott mentioned, in the first half in our Food business, we expect first half earnings to be relatively flat as compared to 2011. And we see noticeable upside in the back half of the year as our various growth capital projects transition to producing product and profit over the coming months. As Scott mentioned, even including some carryover capital spending from 2011 and increased pension funding, Ball continues to generate significant free cash flow. We remain focused on our balanced capital deployment strategy, and will continue to return value to our shareholders via share repurchases, as well as dividends. Our Drive for 10 vision is a mindset around perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goals of more than doubling our EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over time. So with that, Sema, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two quick questions to start, one on Aerospace and the other on use of cash flow and the structure within Beverage Cans. Within Aerospace, it looked like the backlog dropped a little bit. I didn't catch if you said what your expectations were for the rest of '12. But could you comment at all as to whether you think the backlog might be able to hold steady or improve relative programs you know you're likely to get some funding for in the year? The second question, when you look at the U.S. and Europe, it's been more often than not, in the last several quarters, where volumes may have been a little bit softer than you would have expected. Clearly, the scanner data, as we look at it for North America, has been somewhat soft for a lot of your key customers' key products. Do you think -- and what are your plans around, perhaps, further rightsizing the business? And how do you think about the growth expectations and the capacity alignment or the growth you're expecting in your key traditional products in both U.S. and Europe?
John A. Hayes: George, this is John. Let me talk about Aerospace, and I'll have Ray comment on the footprint discussions you were just mentioning. Aerospace, as we know, sometimes, we talk about it being lumpy. And if you look back over the past couple of quarters, we were about $900 million, I think, in the second quarter, moved up to about $950 million at the end of the third and back down. We expect -- given that this is an election year, we don't expect significant changes relative to the U.S. government. So I wouldn't expect significant changes in our backlog over the course of 2012. With the elections coming up in November, I think that's going to be a very important milestone relative to where some of the future funding is going to be. But we feel pretty darn good about where we are on a variety of different programs in a variety of different segments and markets. So we have a good diversified portfolio, and we continue to grow, expect to grow in the Aerospace business going into 2012, '13 and beyond. Ray, do you want to...
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. George, to answer your question, let me start with Europe for a second. We had 2% growth, volume growth in Europe this year. We actually had a program on the drawing boards to add a little bit of capacity potentially in 2012 in Europe, but we're not going to do that. So we are absolutely to the walls in Europe, and we're not going to add any capacity. We'll see how 2012 looks. When I look at North America, our customers are not exactly sure. It's a pretty tough year in volumes in North America, and we're getting some mixed signals out of our customers what they think. But as the market leader in North America, we're not going to run the business with excess capacity. So we have a couple of lines right now, although we'll see how things go. But at the end of the exercise, if demand is there, the capacity is coming out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: First one, just if you, I might have missed this, but you mentioned $200 million is now your run rate in maintenance CapEx. What did you say for the full year you expect CapEx to be this year?
Scott C. Morrison: Right now, going -- this is Scott. Going into this year, it looks like it's around $400 million. But as you saw last year, we pulled -- there was probably $40 million that moved from 2011 that moved into 2012. So it's a little bit higher going into what we had thought maybe 6 months ago. Most of that increase is just due to the movement from '11 to '12.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. And I know it's really early days, but, and it will depend on how the market develops, especially, say, in China, but as you think about this year, if the year unfolds as you expect, like with your full year guidance, that you suggested a stronger second half, do you think you will need to keep that CapEx level around where it is now to keep the capacity coming in where you need it in 2013? In other words, do you think CapEx stays here next year?
Scott C. Morrison: Right now, we're seeing a lot of continued growth opportunities in China. And so more of the cash or more of the CapEx will be oriented towards China in 2012. And really, we evaluate things on an ongoing basis, and that's why things could be added or things could be -- come off the list depending on how volumes materialize in different parts of the world. So for right now, we think $400 million is a decent number, with most of that going into China to keep up with all that growth.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. And one more quick one and you might have mentioned this, but I know that North America in the fourth quarter, your volumes were down 2%. And of course, that's because of the days. Did you give us the -- or can you give us the numbers for the other geographies in that segment, Brazil, as well as Asia?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, sure. Chip, this is Ray. Our volumes in Europe were up a little bit better than 30%, and Brazil was just almost 10%. And that's...
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Asia is 30%?
Raymond J. Seabrook: That's with the less number of days.
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, Asia was 30%.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, Asia was 30%.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And those are clean comps. That's not taking into account increasing your ownership or anything like that from the joint ventures.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Those are clean comps, except for the 6 days. If you add the 6 days, it would be higher, right?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Can you give us an early read on how to think about volumes globally for 2012, perhaps break it down on a quarter basis versus the capacity additions that you have in Asia and Brazil?
John A. Hayes: Ray, do you want to express the...
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, what I would tell you is Europe was up 2% this year, and I believe we're thinking that the market goes up a little bit next year. Our volumes are up slightly. We've -- it's been a pretty tough pricing environment in Europe for us, and so there were some situations that we didn't participate in. But fundamentally, is Europe, I think, will be slightly up for us, but I would say in the 2% range sounds about right. North America is a little bit of a moving market for us. Depending on which customers you're talking to, you get some slightly different answers. But I think -- we think it's probably still slightly down. How much, we're not sure. It depends -- I think it's going to depend on how good the economy is and a bunch of other things. But I don't think it's going to be as down as much as it was this year. It was down about 4%. I think we're thinking of a lower number than that. We're thinking maybe 2%. When you look at China, China continues to grow. We're basically sold-out; every can we make, we can sell. And as a matter of fact, we're kind of oversold a little bit in China in 2012, it won't be up 30% because we haven't increased capacity 30%. I think the number is more in the high teens, high teen number for us in China even though the market will grow probably in the 20% to 25% range. And Brazil, we're hoping -- Brazil was kind of a tough year this year. They had a good first quarter, a terrible second quarter. They had some very interesting weather situations in Brazil this year. So if you talk to our Brazilian colleagues, they'll tell you it was a really difficult weather year. I think we're hoping for somewhere in the 15%, 10% to 15% range again in Brazil for 2012.
John A. Hayes: Yes. Ghansham, I'll just add a little bit more color and even some color around what we talked about first half, second half. When you think about the third quarter for us, the European weather perspective was absolutely horrible in 2011, and just even if you get normal weather patterns, there ought to be some benefit there. That combined with the European soccer championships in Europe, I think, are going to be helpful. And as Ray mentioned, although the context is slightly different in Brazil, we face the same thing as well. So with those 2 important markets for us, I think just the external comparables relative to what we saw in 2011 should be better for us in 2012.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And on the headquarter move, can you share with us how the tax profile of the company will change in the next 3 years or so?
Scott C. Morrison: It's really to better align our organization with how our customers and suppliers are structured and improve process, putting everybody all in the same spot. There'll be some benefits longer term. Not much in the way of '12, but over time we'll expect to get some benefits. And there are some exit costs too that you have to pay when you do some of this -- this type of restructuring. We'll fill you in on those as we get further down the road in 2012.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You talked about the price compression in Europe. Could you just elaborate on that, perhaps, where did you see that, what region?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I think it's really just pretty much throughout. As you know, the European Union, it's been a difficult situation over there, so I think business is difficult for our customers. It's difficult for us. So as our customers look to do business, they're looking for -- they're looking to cut their costs, and we're looking to our suppliers to cut their costs, and sort of it will be through the whole supply chain. I think that there's probably a little bit more capacity in Europe than we'd like to see, but all that's coming out with the volume growth. So it's just been a little bit more difficult than we would've liked to have seen it.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then Scott, can you quantify, perhaps, the underproduction hit that might've occurred this quarter just across the regions?
Scott C. Morrison: Most of it was in North America, both in the Food business and the Beverage business in terms of running -- taking more downtime and running for cash. But the shortfall is probably a hand -- a few cents to $0.05, I would bet.
John A. Hayes: Just to give context to Scott's point, North American beverage cans, we took out -- year-over-year, we produced roughly 300 million less cans, and I think upwards of 1 billion less ends in the fourth quarter. So we really put the brakes on the manufacturing side, and that creates excellent cash flow, and that's what you saw in the quarter. And so I think it sets us up very well going into 2012, where our inventories are where we want them to be, and we feel pretty good about that.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just the last one is you do have the savings from Torrance coming in, in 2012. Roughly how much should that help? Isn't that $20 million-ish of saves that you get kind of right off the bat?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes, we get part of those things started to kick in, but you're right, that was the full year number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies & Company.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: On the food can business, I just want to get a sense how much are tinplate prices expected to be up this year?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. The good news about all that is that the tinplate pricing is up a lot more. We had 2 really high years of tinplate price increases. In 2012 -- which is great news because of D&A exercise. We've still got a product, our customers have a product to sell. So the tinplate prices are up significantly a lot less than they have been in prior years.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. I mean, certainly, last year, you had sizable increases, and then the weather was bad. I mean, the volumes are pretty tough. I mean, margins were still quite good. Is the normalized growth rate going forward in that business down 1% or 2%, or is it still flattish? How should we think about that business?
John A. Hayes: This is John. I would think of it more a flattish type of business. It may be down a little bit, but remember, we had horrible pack in the third quarter if this year, and so that skewed the results. But what you're seeing in terms of the overall economic climate, it actually plays well into processed food such as food cans. And so every given year, you have certain things, deviations from expectations, but we don't see it as a long-term necessarily declining market. We think it's more a flattish market. That's the way we run the business.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just the last question, you commented on some price weakness in Europe. Did you see any leakage in any of your other major markets?
Raymond J. Seabrook: No, not really. I think China is not -- I mean, this is not an easy business. And so we have good competitors that play hard, and so do we. But I would say Europe is where we're seeing most of the pressure. A little bit in China, but I would say primarily Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you just update us again on what you think kind of a longer-term growth rate is in China? I think you mentioned in 2012, you were looking at something in the mid 20s. And then what your plans are right now to grow your own base there.
John A. Hayes: Yes, long term, we continue to see very strong fundamentals in the China marketplace. If you want to put a number, it really depends. I think we're not going to sustain the 30-plus percent growth we've seen over the past couple of years, over the next 10 years, but certainly in the near term. As Ray said, every can made is a can sold right now, and we expect very strong growth to continue in 2012, even in '13. And as the base of that business gets bigger, I think the growth rate itself will start to slow down, but the absolute number of cans being sold, I don't think, necessarily will slow down. We've talked about the can penetration in the beer market really being mid-single digits, the 5%, 6% range as we sit here today versus 50% in developed markets. And when you think about China is the world's biggest beer market, and only 5% of that is packaged in cans. And you have all the people moving from rural areas to urban areas. It sets us up very nicely over the long term. And that's why, as Scott said, a lot of our capital dollars are going into that, and we're very much focused on getting the right team there, getting the right footprint there and doing it very cost-effectively to help us stimulate and continue stimulate the demand. So all those things are core to our China strategy.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And I think you mentioned last quarter that you might be moving some lines from the U.S. over to China?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, we're actively looking at that. I said we had a couple of lines right now that we've got out of commission. And as we expand in China -- we generally have some really good equipment in the U.S. We don't have stuff that's not good. So our preference would be to relocate the equipment from mature markets to emerging markets. So we're all about that.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then it sounded like in Brazil, you were expecting a pretty nice bounce back in 2012 in terms of volumes. It seems like some of the reports we see coming out of Brazil are that the Brazilian economy is growing slower. So can you just kind of help us reconcile that?
John A. Hayes: Yes. On one hand, the economy is growing slower. But on the other hand, the middle class is increasing and the wages are going into the pockets more quickly. They had a minimum wage increase that was in the range of 10%, 12%, which is actually good for our business because as the middle class rises, they have more disposable income. And then they go and purchase products such as those that we produce. So despite the overall economy being a little bit -- the growth of it being a little bit lower than it's been in the past, we still think there's good prospects relative to the consumer need for our product.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And just last on that, what's the penetration rate in Brazil right now do you estimate in beer?
John A. Hayes: On the beer side, it's mid- to upper 30%. It's kind of 36%, 37%, in and around there. And it's been increasing, and it continues to penetrate further, and so it's good for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I think this is the fourth quarter in a row that I've asked this, but how are the trends in Eastern Europe versus Western Europe? Is that holding up as well? Or do you expect there's going to be some weakness there this year?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. In 2011, Eastern Europe was a little slower than historically it has been. If you go back the last 5 years, probably the last 3 or last 5, Eastern Europe's been growing quite nicely. I think with all this euro and the difficult, if you will, economy that they've had in Europe, Eastern Europe has slowed more than potentially Western Europe.
John A. Hayes: What it's going to look like for '12, I think we're still thinking it could be a little bit on the slower slide.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on Brazil. We've heard, based on our checks, that it looks like the consumer there has gotten a bit more used to the pricing that was put through at the first of last year. Have you seen that? And is that at all responsible for the fact that it would look like demand is coming back now during the peak summer period?
John A. Hayes: I think that's part of it, certainly. There was, as you rightly pointed out, the first quarter last year, a big price increase driven in part by taxes from the government, et cetera, and that did put a short-term damper on it. And then as we went through the balance of the year, as we said, the weather was not all that great. So as we sit here beginning of 2012, as we know, it's on the back end of their summer season right now. But I think for the full year 2012, we expect it to be getting back, a little bit back on track relative to what we've seen over the past few years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Wenning with Morningstar.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: With so much dry powder to repurchase shares now, what will your strategy be as it pertains to timing those purchases over the year? Will you look to repurchase them when you consider them to be good absolute value, good relative value to other capital allocations or something else?
Scott C. Morrison: We tend to be a pretty steady buyer of our shares, and we also tend to load up earlier in the year to orient more of our share repurchases to earlier in the year. So I would expect we'll continue that same pattern in 2012 and be pretty steady throughout the year but probably a little more heavy, in terms of repurchasing, in the first half.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then if my calculations are right, based on your historical capital allocation strategy, and in light of your new buyback and dividend and CapEx plans, it seems like there's not a lot of cash flow left for acquisitions this year. Does that mean you're finding fewer acquisition opportunities that meet or exceeded your return on capital targets?
John A. Hayes: No, I wouldn't say that at all. In fact, if you look at last year, it's probably good representation of what we did -- of what our philosophy around that. We generated $0.5 billion in cash. But at the same time, we bought back or gave dividends of roughly $0.5 billion. We spent $250 million on growth capital, and we acquired a business worth over $300 million. So our debt went up, but our leverage ratios went down because of the operating performance of our company. And that's the model that's worked very successfully for us. And so we always want to keep the right amount of, to use your words, dry powder because you never know when opportunities present themselves. And so when you're strong financially, you have more flexibility and more options, and that's what we're going to do as we go forward.
Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Great. Just one more. How are you thinking about the Aerospace and Technology product positioning in light of the new Department of Defense guidance that was issued earlier this month?
John A. Hayes: Yes, we actually feel pretty good about where we are because we're very good at low-cost, high-value, fixed-price projects. That's what the government really needs right now. They need better cost, better value, and that fits right into the sweet spot of why we've been successful and right in the sweet spot of why we're optimistic as we go forward relative to some of those things.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of quick questions for you, but if I could start at -- on the capital side, you're spending again about $200 million beyond what you consider maintenance. If I've kind of done my math right, I'm not sure if I have, I think most of the capital is already spent for the capacity edge you have going in the new plant in China, the new plant -- capacity in Brazil. There's probably a pretty good slug yet -- could you help us fill out what that $200 million or so is going towards?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, it's Scott. As I mentioned, we probably had $40 million of that moved from 2011 into 2012 to finish some of these projects. As John, I think, mentioned in his comments, a lot of the things that were being built have moved into the first quarter of 2012 to complete them. So there's $40 million there. And then a pretty good chunk of the rest of the growth capital is oriented towards China.
John A. Hayes: Yes, as Ray said, every can made is a can sold right now, and we're short-capacity a little bit. So as we go into 2012, we have some projects that we haven't publicly announced as to where they are, but we plan on moving forward with those.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, we've got another new plant on the drawing boards for China. We've got -- we're relocating some equipment in China. We've got end capacity, as well, these cans, come to the fact that we need some more ends, we've got end capacity in China. And quite frankly, we do have some other opportunities in different parts of the world that are looking very encouraging. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here, but there's some of the things that if things go our way, that could add some nice addition to our company.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's true. The next one I want to understand is it sounds like you still have some room for some other projects that haven't been announced yet.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes.
Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And as far as looking at -- I think, the last gentleman asked about acquisitions. But as far as looking at new flags on the ground, so to speak, or new areas that you could be targeting for development, can you maybe give us an update there as to what space globally that you think about capacity adds or markets that are attractive?
John A. Hayes: We don't want to go into too much detail given the public nature of this phone call. But we are actively looking, as Ray just even mentioned, at some things. We are very financially disciplined around things like that, and that's why some of the timing of these issues are unclear. We're also very much customer-driven and what we mean by that is typically, when we build a new plant, as you've heard in Brazil and other places, we do it -- we first enter into long-term agreements with the customer, so we know what we're dealing with relative to volume and pricing. And then we take the risk on the manufacturing side, which we're quite comfortable doing. Now getting specifically to your question, we've been doing some things on the impact to the distributed Aerosol business, whether it's adding new capacity in our European operations, which we did in 2011, or some other things we've been looking at. But also, on the Beverage Can side, in terms of geographic growth, in terms of new products, all those things are the focus that we've been trying to rally ourselves around with respect toward Drive for 10 vision. And I don't want to go into specifics on what those are right now, but as Ray said, if a couple of things go our way, we feel pretty darn good about where we are, and we'll make our company a better company and more profitable company.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Dan Schniewind with AMI Asset Management.
Daniel T. Schniewind - AMI Asset Management Corporation: It looks like you have some paper callable in '18, and you've got some other debt. It's a little bit higher coupon. Have you guys given any thought kind of tapping kind of the available market now and maybe refining your debt into maybe a benchmark deal or a little bit bigger size to increase your flexibility?
Scott C. Morrison: We look at our debt portfolio all the time and manage it, I think, opportunistically. So we're always looking at the economics of doing something like that, but we haven't decided to do that yet.
Daniel T. Schniewind - AMI Asset Management Corporation: Okay. And as far as acquisitions go, in the future, would you guys look to do those through debt or through cash?
Scott C. Morrison: Last year, that was up almost the exact amount of our acquisitions. So it really -- as John was talking about, we have a variety of levers that we can pull given our strong free cash flow. And so it kind of depends on the situation, what's the optimal way to finance something. And then again, it gets back to being opportunistic with the debt markets, too. So it depends.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Crédit Suisse.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just wanted to ask a question on Aerocan, and given its focus on some of the consumer discretionary in Europe, are you still seeing high-single-digit, like low-double-digit growth rates with the business? Any impact on the macro conditions there?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I would tell you that this year, very early after we bought that business, as we put some capacity in, we probably took the majority of the market growth in Europe. Now I said we were up almost 20%. I wouldn't say our competitors were up the same kind of numbers. We have a very -- a business that's probably low-cost in Europe, and so it's very successful. I would tell you that the volumes in '12 will not be up to the same extent. We expect a slight volume increase but not to the same magnitude we had in '11.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then also, I guess in France, on the soda tax potentially, any thoughts on any potential impact there?
John A. Hayes: No, you know what, it's not a meaningful -- we don't believe it to be a meaningful impact to us even if it were to occur. It really gets down to the retail price of it. Could there be a modest impact? Maybe, but in the totality of our European operations and even the totality of our company, it's not material.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just last housekeeping question on corporate expense. How should we be thinking about it for 2012?
Scott C. Morrison: It should be relatively flat year-over-year.
Albert T. Kabili - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Even with the share price the way it is in the fourth quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions for you. In Europe, some of your competitors across a different substrate are very aggressively looking to take price there. It looks like aluminum prices are down on top of that. You're saying that you're seeing some general pricing compression for cans. Are you seeing any customers approach you to look at potentially switching from glass to cans?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I'll let you answer that, John, but I personally haven't seen it, but I'll defer to John.
John A. Hayes: In the short term, the filling lines of bottles versus cans are different. And so in the short term, because of pricing activity, we don't see any material shifts in substrates that are being used for the packaging of it. As Ray said earlier, though, the European market generally is a very tough market right now. You have unemployment high. You have not only the economies being soft, but there could be threats of double dips, and it always puts pressure on the supply chain, and that's what we're seeing. And so without knowing specifics more about other substrates, I would just tell you pricing environment for virtually every industry right now in Europe is challenging.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A question on China. You guys are, I think, the leading player there with about 31% share. How much further do you think you can grow your market share in China before you may run into some anticompetitive issues?
John A. Hayes: Well, as you know, China is such a large country, number one. And we have more growth right now just keeping up with market demand, let alone market share shifts that we have not really focused too much on increasing our market share, although we're going to -- we certainly want to, at a minimum, hold our market share. More longer term, I think there's probably some regional opportunities but not wholesale. But remember, there's -- we're, far and away, the largest. We have another competitor that's relatively large there, and then it gets pretty fragmented at that, and it really starts to focus on the regional -- regions of China as opposed to the country as a whole.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just last question for Scott. Looking at the free cash flow numbers for '11, it looks like there were about $200 million of other items that positively boosted the free cash flow number to north of $500 million. What I'm really trying to get at is what's the core change in the cash flow of the business in '12 relative to '11 if you were to adjust '11 for that $200 million of other items of positive cash flow?
Scott C. Morrison: Well, the big item would be the pension funding versus expense. So that's going to go up $85 million year-over-year. So we had very little pension funding that was required in '11 and more -- a larger increase in 2012. The working capital would also be a big swing. Where it was a pretty big source of cash flow in '11. We're going to try to keep most of that out in '12, but we'll see. And those would be the 2 big components.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Is there anything on taxes?
Scott C. Morrison: Nothing really material in taxes.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A few things to clean up. One of the paperboard companies was reporting recently, and they're talking about increased installations, both of their systems and their board for multipacks, especially around cans. I guess I'm preaching a little bit to the converted here, but are you seeing that in any particular regions? And are you seeing it more in soft drink or beer? That would be question #1. Question #2, back to North America, you're forecasting, to some degree, a lesser rate of decline in North America versus '11's 4% or so decline. That's not great, but it is a little bit better. Does that suggest at all that your customers in North America are rethinking their price versus volume strategy or not?
John A. Hayes: One of the -- Ray, why don't you talk about North America, and I'll come back for the global?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. It's funny. It's a little more customer-specific, so, and I don't want to go into that, George. So certain customers, I don't think, are seeing it exactly the same way. So we have some customers that I think are -- their volumes didn't decline quite as much. And they're not thinking about making some tremendous changes. We have other customers that probably, their volumes did decline more and are rethinking some of their strategies. So it's kind of a mixed bag, to be quite honest with you. I think on the beer side, I think the guys probably are more wedded to their pricing strategies, I think. In the soft drink side, it's a little different, I think. So that's what I would tell you about North America.
John A. Hayes: Yes, with respect to the multi-packing, George, as you know, it's quite prevalent in the United States. We've seen a lot of activity going on there relative to whether it's microbrewers going in the multipacks if they haven't. Or you're seeing many of our customers change the pack size, change the pack configuration. But outside the United States, multi-packing is really not -- has not been a big phenomenon, and that's what provides a good opportunity. Even in Europe, multi-packing is not the norm. It's more of an exception. And so we are seeing some activity there. China, I think, is another big opportunity as the urbanization occurs there and the change to the retail trade. When you have many more of the big box stores going into China, which is exploding there, they really like to push multipacks because of convenience. And so I think you're going to see that as time goes forward as well. And so obviously, as you said, we're talking of converting here, but it's helpful to our business, and some of these other areas ramp up the penetration of the can.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So it's opportunity, but you're not really seeing it yet in the volumes. That'd be the summary, right?
John A. Hayes: . What I'm saying is we are seeing it, but I wouldn't say that it's wholesale right now. There's a lot of experimentation going on.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. Two last questions, and I'll turn it over. You mentioned at the beginning that you renewed your contract on the Rocky Mountain Beverage Can plant agreement. Did you also say, if you did, I missed, and I apologize, that you also renewed your entire agreement with MillerCoors? And then secondly, in food cans, what's the latest on BPA both in terms of coatings and customers' expectations?
John A. Hayes: Okay. Your first question, yes, we did say that we extended our agreement with MillerCoors. Getting back on the BPA, as most people know that we expect by the end of March for the FDA to make an announcement around it. We don't expect there to be any surprises of the science side of it. We've talked about that before. But unfortunately, this is in the political arena to some degree, and that's not of our control. Irrespective of that, George, and this is really getting to the crux of your question, we feel really good about the progress we've made and can now offer alternatives to meet any regulatory pronouncement for the vast majority of our products. So we are anticipating the FDA to say something. We don't expect it to be wholesale change. But as I said, you never know. And we'll adjust working with our suppliers on one hand and customers on the other hand. To the extent that we need to do something, we certainly have to consider that.
Operator: Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at this time.
John A. Hayes: Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for participating, and we, here, all look forward to a good 2012. And we'll speak to you 3 months from now. Everyone, have a good first quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 27, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
John A. Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Edison. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2011 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.  Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our results and Ray will follow-up with details about our packaging operations. I'll close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for the balance of the year and beyond.  As mentioned in our press release, Ball reported improved third quarter results despite a difficult economic environment in most of our key markets. After starting slow, global demand for beverage cans accelerated towards the end of the quarter and it improved throughout the quarter in every market or nearly every market. The numerous CapEx projects in Packaging and Aerospace are proceeding nicely and are on budget and on time. Recent M&A investments continue to perform very well and are above expectations.  As many of you know, we held an Investor Conference out here in Colorado 2 weeks ago. Over 40 investors and analysts participated and we certainly appreciate all of you who came. At our conference, we discussed our Drive for 10 vision for the company in the areas in which we are providing increased emphasis. And as we look to the future, we know and are focused on those things that have made us successful in the past, including prudent risk management and disciplined capital deployment. I will not go into all that we discussed on today's call, but if you'd like a transcript, please feel free to reach out to Ann Scott, our Director of Investor Relations, and she can provide you with the transcript and background materials that were reviewed.  Our global employee team continues to do a great job of executing on our strategy, including maximizing the value of our existing businesses while capitalizing on growth in emerging markets and offering our customers a variety of new products from which they can grow and win in the marketplace. These efforts are providing Ball with opportunities to finish up the year strong and to grow in 2012 and beyond.  With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott C. Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.81 versus last year's $0.70, 16% year-over-year improvement. The following factors contributed to improved results: the consolidation of our majority-owned Brazilian JV; the acquisition of the Extruded Aluminum business in Europe; volume improvements in North America, Brazil and China; exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business; benefits of share repurchases; a lower effective tax rate largely driven by tax benefits from foreign exchange on a local currency basis in Brazil; and a $0.02 FX translation benefit in the quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by a year-over-year increase in net interest expense due to our recent acquisition and the consolidation of Brazil.  As a reminder, the first 9 months of performance was favorably impacted by 6 additional accounting days in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter will include 6 fewer accounting days than the prior-year. So when we talk about comparable volumes, we are adjusting first 9 months' volumes to reflect the extra days. For a complete summary of the third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Turning to full-year financial metrics, we expect CapEx will approach $500 million. We also expect 2011 free cash flow to be at least $400 million. We plan to repurchase at least $450 million of our shares and through the first 9 months of 2011 we acquired a net $381 million of stock. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be a little over $3 billion. And the full-year effective tax rate will run under 31%.  Our solid balance sheet and highly competitive capital structure allowed the company to operate from a position of strength. We will continue executing our long-standing value-creation model of balanced capital deployment and consistently returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the Packaging operations.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Beverage can volumes were up in the quarter in the Americas and the Asia segment, and are up through the first 9 months. In the quarter, U.S. volumes were up slightly, Brazil volumes were up in the mid-single digits and China volumes were up in the mid-teens. Segment operating earnings were hurt in the quarter due to out-of-pattern freight incurred while supporting our manufacturing realignment projects, as well as unfavorable sales mix in Brazil. Out-of-pattern freight should now subside with the completion of these projects in the U.S.  The North American capital spending projects are virtually complete. The new Whitby and Fort Worth can lines have been installed and are running well. Then new Alumi-Tek bottle can line being installed in our Golden, Colorado, plant will be making commercial cans in early November. The new can lines being built in Brazil and Vietnam are on schedule and on budget. Our new China can plant being built in Qingdao is now expected to be online in January 2012. We look forward to continuing strong volume growth in China in 2012, and expect to be able to sell every can we make in China again next year.  The cool, wet summer in Northern Europe negatively impacted our beverage can volumes in the quarter, but had little impact on the Aluminum Aerosol volumes. Beverage can volumes were down high-single digits in the quarter, but continued to be up slightly through the first 9 months, while Aerocan's aluminum aerosol volumes were up 20% compared to last year in the quarter and year-to-date. Weather conditions also impacted volumes in the U.S., the Metal Food and Household Products segment. The South was too hot and dry and the Midwest too wet. Overall our volumes in the quarter were off mid-single digits and manufacturing costs were a little higher due to production curtailments.  As we start the fourth quarter, the weather has been much better in North America and Europe and so far beverage can sales are ahead of expectations. Our plants are performing very well, and we look forward to finishing this year with a positive traction as we get set for another very busy year in 2012.  With that, I'll turn it back to John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks Ray. A few comments on Aerospace and then the outlook. Our Aerospace and Technology business posted double-digit EBIT margins in the third quarter. Earnings increased primarily due to the continued excellent program performance. Backlog ended the quarter at $986 million versus backlog at the end of the second quarter of $903 million. Ball Aerospace's capabilities are strategically important to our customers, and our focus on delivering best cost, best value solutions is allowing our backlog to continue to grow. From a funding perspective, most of the 2012 projects are in good shape.  In terms of program highlights, NPP is scheduled for launch tomorrow from Vandenberg Air Force Base. NPP is a new generation of earth-observing satellites that will have the ability to measure a wide variety of atmospheric issues, including ozone and other climate-related items.  Also during the quarter, we delivered software that is key to the James Webb Space Telescope program. During our recent investor field trip, guests viewed 1 of the 18-mirror segments that will perform in space as a single monolithic mirror.  So in summary for the corporation, we overcame a pretty tough economic environment during the third quarter and feel good about the rest of the year. July and August were pretty challenging and by September, things started bouncing back. Despite the 7% fewer accounting days in the fourth quarter, we anticipated a strong close to 2011 and certainly momentum headed into 2012.  So with that, Edison, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions. I guess, John, maybe I'll start with the final question, usually. In terms of the outlook, you said you expect to close strongly despite the fewer shipping days. Should we take that as an increase in earnings year-on-year versus the fourth quarter? And just for the record, what was the fourth quarter 2010 from an EPS standpoint from your vantage point?
John A. Hayes: Yes. It was -- I believe it was $0.53 last year, George, and that was, I know, up over -- well over 20% from the year-prior. We do have 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter, but despite this, we feel good going into the fourth quarter. Volumes have appeared to stabilize and are now growing again in most of our businesses which provide the momentum that I talked about. The tough comp that we have in the fewer days create a hole from which we need to overcome, but at this time we think we can accomplish that, and we could do a little better, but we'll see.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I appreciate the color. With Aerospace, we're pleased to see the backlog pick up. To the extent that you can comment on these sorts of things, where did you see the backlog pick up in terms of types of programs or markets?
John A. Hayes: Well, George, I think it was a little bit more of a timing issue. If you recall in the second quarter, that's when the U.S. deficit issue was ongoing in Congress, and so a lot of the funding for those programs had stalled. And once we got past at least that short-term hurdle we were able to see some of the funding come back.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Now you mentioned that you feel pretty good about the funding through '12. Should we read into that, that you are less certain, I guess that would be obvious, but maybe more than we would want you to feel, less certain about the outlook for '13 funding?
John A. Hayes: Nothing abnormal, George. We're not aware of anything. Just, as we all know, the U.S. government is going through some difficult challenges, but we know nothing that says anything is at risk more than it typically would be. I've talked in the past about a lot of what we do are very strategic to what we do as a country, and some of these are replacement-type things. And so we believe the funding should be good, but again, we're dealing with Washington, so one never knows.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Last one. What are your customers telling you about Europe and the outlook for next year in terms of Beverage Cans in particular? Where do you see operating rates? One of your packaging peers, although in a different substrate, today was talking about perhaps taking prices up for 2012. How do you think that all flushes out as you think about the year next year?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. George, this is Ray. I think that -- we were -- without this volume shortfall that happened to us in July and August, we were thinking of adding capacity because we were fundamentally sold out. We're going to try to run next year with not adding capacity, but we're going to be tight. So we're not thinking about reducing prices, that's for sure.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with RW Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Ray, can you just clarify what volumes in Beverage were down for Europe in the third quarter? Was it high-single digits, is that what you said?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, Europe was down 8%, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Down 8%. And can you parse that between the different regions, and maybe beer versus soft drinks too?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well since we're heavily -- more heavily weighted to beer, it was more beer than soft drinks. And we're much more -- we're really not -- we're not located so much in the South, most of our business is in the North. And so I think that was -- I think the South was actually a little bit better. I think when you get into Spain and some of those countries, I don't think the volumes were down quite as bad. But when you talk about England and Northern Europe, they had a -- just a terrible July and August for weather, and it really impacted us.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And just as a follow-up to George's question on promotional activity, you sort of touched on Europe. But what are your major customers saying about North America? Because it seems like you and your peers are just mirroring what your customers are seeing in terms of volume weakness, maybe there's a little bit of inventory correction, but in terms of promotional activity looking out to 2012, is there a reason to be a little bit more optimistic in North America?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, I think it depends on the customer. Some of our customers are actually quite optimistic and some of them are not as optimistic. So you'd almost have to go through it piece by piece. But I think we're looking for flat to maybe slightly down. The market was down close to 3.5% this year or 3.8% year-to-date. We're not looking for any kind of decline anywhere near that next year. It could be down 1% or flat, but that's -- it depends on the customer, quite frankly, Ghansham.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Just -- with the Bev Can volumes in Europe, just to clarify, I think you mentioned that they are trending ahead of expectations so far in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that you think you'll see core growth or had the decline lessened versus 3Q?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I think, the weather in July and August in Northern Europe was -- talking to people that were there, which I wasn't, but it was the worst they had seen in a long, long time. And I think it really did, it really impacted. By the week -- every time it got to a weekend it was cold and rainy, and it really impacted our volumes. Remember, the -- our European business is our most seasonal business. 70% of what we do is in the middle 2 quarters. So it had an impact on us. In the fourth quarter, the weather seemed to get better. We were over there in September and the weather seemed to break. So, ever since September and October, the volume has been much stronger than we otherwise would have expected to see. So we're expecting to finish up good this year, and get back to more of a normal year next year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You guys have made a lot of investments in Asia and Brazil in the theory it's a faster growing market and nicer margins in general. When should we expect some of those returns flowing through and improved margins in that segment? And is this more of a low-teen, mid-teen type of business going forward?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes. I would -- again, this is Ray. I think the -- I don't think you're going to see it so much in margins, what I think where you're going to see it is in the top line. I mean fundamentally, we're growing the business. I mean our margins are -- we think our margins are okay where they're at. And what you're going to see, you're going to see it at the top line.
Scott C. Morrison: Top line as well as EBIT growth. I think what Ray is saying is we don't expect to see a significant amount of margin expansion.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Ant then can you talk about trends in Brazil. Certainly in Q2 it was a little soft, it sounds like things have picked up a bit in 3Q. I just want to get your thoughts heading into the peak summer season.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, as a matter of fact, I was talking to somebody from Brazil yesterday and they said that the weather has started to get a lot better. Our volumes certainly picked up near the end of the quarter. We were up high-single digits and we're expecting to be up. And year-to-date, we're not up as much because we had a very slow second quarter, but we're expecting to pick a lot of that up in the fourth quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Could you -- first question is, could you talk a little bit about what you think has changed with your customers, especially beer? Is it just you think the debt crisis and the macro discussions that were going on in August or is there something else going on that would've explained sort of the weak July, August and then the much stronger September. I know the weather was a factor, but normally I think your customers tend to let their inventories go down, especially in Europe, this time of year.
John A. Hayes: Yes. This is John. I'll take that, then maybe turn it over to Ray. It really was the weather -- I presume you're talking about Europe, so I'll focus my comments on Europe.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Yes, primarily.
John A. Hayes: It really was a weather issue. It's a -- the way that the beer gets sold throughout the summer, people were not having their barbecues on the weekends, people were not out in the pubs. It literally was, in Fahrenheit terms, 55 degrees, 65 degrees and raining the whole time. And that is just not conducive to beer drinking. And so when we talked to our customers and you look at some of the public comments of many of our customers that operate in Western and Northwestern Europe, you see exactly what we're talking about.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Got you. And as you -- you gave us a good roadmap in Colorado, a couple of weeks ago. And could you just update us on the specific timing, I believe in addition to China which you mentioned first quarter -- and this may be more for Ray -- when you expect the Brazil plant and the Vietnam plant to start up? And maybe it's early days, but what sort of comes behind this? You suggested that, given your market share, you could justify doing 3 plants a year.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, Brazil -- actually, Brazil plant comes up in March and the Vietnam plant comes up in March. And we saw, again some numbers yesterday, and when our board ran we -- Vietnam is sold out as we speak. And Brazil, we have our long-term contract and we expect that to be sold out as well. And so, when we turn to China, and we look at our -- remember, one of our strategies is to keep our capacity utilization in balance. And I could see potentially relocating another line from the U.S. into China next year, and we do have to continue to expand China. I think I said when you were out here, expect 1.4 billion cans to be additional volume next year for us. And then, the year after that we've got the same thing going on, so we've got to get capacity in to meet it.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: And do you expect as you do this that most of what you're building is actually taking share from other substrates or --
Raymond J. Seabrook: No, no, not at all.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: -- is all of it growth? Or is all of it just market growth?
Raymond J. Seabrook: It's -- well, it's a combination of both, right? It's can penetration and it's also market growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wonder if you could just elaborate on the out-of-pattern freight that you talked about. How much did that impact the quarter?
Scott C. Morrison: It was probably in the mid-single digits in terms of cost, millions of bucks. There's a -- we have a little bit of inflation. Remember, in a lot of our contracts we have a lag in terms of pass-through of inflation. So there's a little of bit of that too, but nothing out of -- really out of the ordinary. The out-of-pattern shipping and warehousing should -- it's pretty much done now.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then in the America's Food side, could you talk about the trends in Food versus Aerosol? You said down mid-single for the whole business, but maybe just parse that out?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Yes, what we said was down 4% in the quarter. For Food, that wasn't the whole business. Our Aerosol business is down a little bit more than that and the reason is that we had lost some business in the first quarter to a competitor. Now I know that the CMI numbers, it looks like the market's down more than it really is because the competitor that we lost that business to, their numbers are not in the CMI numbers. So the market's not -- the Aerosol market's not down that much. The business that -- and the fortunate part for us is the business that we lost was pretty low-margin business for us.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then how are you thinking about fourth quarter trends on the Food side?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Well, the Food business -- remember, we're more heavily weighted to veggies and the seasonal than probably some of our competitors are. So when we finish the third quarter, it's -- Aerosol is not that way, but when you go talk about the Food side, there's not a lot to be done. So we've obviously got some shipping and some things to do, but the Food business is fundamentally done for us at the end of the third quarter. Not -- that's not the case with Aerosol. So we expect the fourth quarter to kind of be a little -- be less than last year, but we would still expect to make more in our Food Can business in this -- in 2011 than we did in '10.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It was great going down in Golden again and seeing the facility, and it's amazing how efficient that plant is even though it dates back to the '60s. I was wondering directionally, can you comment -- is there further room to improve within North America on things like skeleton, metal usage and line speeds; in other words, how do you keep improving returns within an existing base of investment that's been around for a number of years? And how would you size that for us right now?
Raymond J. Seabrook: I'll start then I'll pass it over to John, George. But one of the things that I'm always amazed at, remember, my -- if you go back, I'm kind of a financial guy in my background. But the strength of our company really rests on our plant floor. When you go into those plants and those guys that work there, I'm always amazed at the quality of people and the expertise of our people. So the law of diminishing returns is obviously it gets harder and harder all the time, but I guarantee you, every year we put together our plans and operating plan, and there's always performance improvements that those plants have generated. So if there's one thing I can tell you is that the one thing I have all the confidence in the world in, it's our people that work in the plants and they just do a tremendous job.
John A. Hayes: Yes, they really do. And in fact, if you look over the past couple of years since we've acquired the former Metal Container plant, some of those efficiencies have actually accelerated. We've put some new systems in place to help provide the data in a more predictive way and our guys are just doing a fantastic job. And so we expect as we go forward to be able to continue to get more efficiency out of these plants. And it's -- people always think that there has to be a curve that starts to slow down, and I'm sure there is one, but our guys have proven that we haven't seen the end yet.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, could you size the improvement in productivity one way or another? Either output can grow a percent a year or you can keep the output the same, but reduce the investment by a percent a year? How would you, if you would, have us think about that?
Raymond J. Seabrook: Here's what happens, George. As we make improvements and the output improves, that means that -- if the market's not growing, that means we -- that means that we free up assets. And I just said that, fundamentally, I probably expect to relocate another can line probably to an emerging market this year, and the reason I expect to do that is the efficiencies we're talking about.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A fair point, Ray. I guess the other question I had, maybe to wrap up from our side, what are the imperatives that you're seeing for 2012 and are there going to be any changes in incentive comp, or how are you going to align incentive comp around those imperatives as you look at it? I realize it's not January yet, but if you have an early read on that, we'd appreciate it.
John A. Hayes: George, as you know, our incentive comp, from our level all the way down to the plant floor in many cases, is based on return on investment. And we've been investing a lot this year and so next year is about getting the returns from those investments. So a lot of next year is about execution on the projects that have gone in. Whether it is the Alumi-Tek line in Golden that's up later this month or early in November, whether it's about Whitby and Fort Worth that Ray talked about, whether it's about Brazil, whether it's about Qingdao, whether it's about Vietnam, it's time to start generating the return from those investments that are just getting in and put on the ground.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: When you go back and look over the last 2 years, and what's kind of interesting is 2 years ago was just after you closed on Metal Container or were about to. You basically have used all your free cash flow and maybe you've even then some to buy back stock, and I guess just as you think about it fundamentally next year, is that something that we would expect to see continue? And said differently, let's say you don't find a -- obviously if you find a major acquisition that makes sense, you don't want to push the envelope too far. But barring that, is there any reason why you wouldn't continue to use all your free cash flow essentially to buy back stock?
Scott C. Morrison: No, this is Scott. Actually if you look back over the last 24 months, by the end of this year, I think we'll bought -- we'll have bought back about $1 billion of stock, we've made a $0.5 billion of acquisitions, and $0.5 billion of investments in growth capital. So when I talked before about balanced capital deployment, you can do a lot of things at the same time. And the cash machine has been growing. If you recall back when you were here at the Investor Conference, I showed how the cash -- free cash flow had been growing over the last decade or so. And with the investments that we're making, we expect that to continue to grow, and so it gives us even more capability to continue to do a variety of things at the same time and so orienting a lot of our free cash flow to buying back our stock. We don't have much in the way of debt maturities, our balance sheet's in good shape, we have a lot of liquidity. So I would expect the vast majority of our free cash flow, if not all of it or more, to be going back to be buying back our stock. While still investing in a lot of growth projects.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it over back to you, Mr. Hayes.
John A. Hayes: Okay, great. Thank you, Edison, and I appreciate it. We appreciate all of your support and it was good to see all of you a couple of weeks ago, and we look forward to talking to you on our January call. Everyone, have a good fourth quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 28, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
John Hayes: Thank you, Lyn, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding the Company's Second Quarter Results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our results and Ray will follow with details about our packaging operations. I'll close with comments in aerospace and the outlook for the balance of the year and beyond.  As mentioned in our press release Ball reported solid second quarter results due largely to our people executing well against our strategy, maximizing value in our existing businesses, and our company's broadening our geographic reach and expanding into new products and capabilities.  Highlights from the quarter include: overall volume growth in our global beverage can businesses of more than 3% and strong operating performance across all of our businesses; excellent program performance in our aerospace business, continued double-digit growth in emerging markets, particularly China; benefits from our prior actions to better match our supply with market demand in North America; and better-than-anticipated performance from aluminum slug and extruded aluminum aerosol businesses we acquired in the second half of last year and early this year.  In addition to our strong results in the quarter, we broke ground on 3 emerging market beverage can plants in Brazil, China and Vietnam; started a beverage can line in Serbia and relocated beverage can equipment in Canada; completed our expansion of our aerospace antenna manufacturing capabilities; began expansion of our satellite manufacturing operations in Boulder, Colorado; launched our new North American packaging graphic center in Colorado; and earlier this month, launched our 8-ounce trim can in the United States to meet school guidelines.  Our numerous CapEx projects that are diversified among many of our businesses from here in North America to Europe, Asia and South America are on track and doing quite well in. Continue to monitor supply and demand in each of those markets and recent M&A investments are performing well above expectations.  So in short, despite a challenging economic backdrop that muted volumes in several of our key markets, Ball is performing quite well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.85 versus last year's $0.69, a 23% year-over-year improvement. The following factors contributed to improved results: consolidation of our majority-owned Brazilian JV; the acquisition of the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe and North America; volume improvements and excellent operating performance in our metal packaging businesses, particularly in China; exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business; benefits of share repurchases; and a $0.04 FX benefit in the quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by a year-over-year increase in interest expense due to recent acquisitions and the consolidation of Brazil.  As a reminder, first half performance was favorably impacted by 6 additional accounting days in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. Second half 2011 performance will include 6 fewer accounting days in the fourth quarter than the prior year. So when we talk about comparable volumes, we are adjusting the first half volumes to reflect the extra days. For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.  There are no changes or updates to our 2011 financial metrics provided on our April call. We still anticipate full year interest expense to be closer to $185 million, our full year effective tax rate will run close to 32%. CapEx will approach $500 million. And as we said before, we expect 2011 free cash flow of at least $400 million, the majority of free cash flow going to share repurchases. Through the first 6 months of 2011, we've acquired a net $241 million of our stock.  At current exchange rates, yearend net debt is expected to be approximately $3 billion, up slightly due to the Aerocan acquisition. The balance sheet is solid, our capital structure is highly competitive, the operations are providing strong results and cash flow. We will continue our long-standing approach to balanced capital deployment and consistently return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.
Raymond Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. Overall, our packaging business continued to perform in line with expectations despite some challenging economies and weather in selected parts of the globe. Execution on capital spending projects is progressing as planned, and all projects are within budget.  From an overall beverage can market perspective through June, we are seeing volumes up in international markets, in North America, we are doing better than the market. On a comparable basis, our North American beverage can volumes were flat in the quarter, about 2% through 6 months. Through the first half, operating earnings in the Americas are also well ahead of last year, and that's a trend we expect to see to continue through the remainder of the year. We are working hard on lowering our manufacturing cost structure and leveraging innovation in North America.  The Torrance, California plant will be closed in the fourth quarter; relocation of the 12-ounce can line to Whitby, Ontario is complete; a new specialty can line will be up and running in our Fort Worth, Texas plant by September; and a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line will also be up and running in our Golden, Colorado plant by the end of the year.  Year-to-date volumes in China are up over 35% due to strong market demand and the acquisition of the Foshan joint venture beverage can plant in June of last year. Our China manufacturing capacity is stretched, and we are speeding up existing equipment wherever feasible and bringing on more capacity with the new beverage can plant in Qingdao, China by the end of the year. We continue to foresee short a longer-term growth prospects in Asia, net -- and we plan to grow with our customers, which will most certainly require further investments as we look to 2012 and beyond.  In the quarter, Brazil beverage can volumes were softer than expected due to higher beer pricing and a wet winter cold season. We expect a better second half as we move into the summer season in Brazil, with year-over-year volume increases in the 5% to 7% range. The construction of a new beverage can plant in Alagoinhas has commenced, and we look forward to the startup of this plant in the first quarter of next year.  In our European operations, trends are also positive. European beverage can volumes, up 5% on a comparable basis through the first 6 months. The production output of the newly installed second beverage line in our Belgrade, Serbia plant is meeting expectations. Despite cool summer weather in Europe so far this year, supply/demand balance remains relatively tight.  Aluminum aerosol volumes are up over 20% year-over-year in our Ball Aerocan business, which we acquired in January of this year. With discontinuing[ph] strong demand, we plan further aerosol capacity additions for 2012. Now the food and household products results in the second quarter were solid and volumes held up reasonably well in the quarter. Food can volumes were flat and aerosol volumes were slightly lower. Second quarter operating earnings benefited from lower administrative and manufacturing costs, sales price mix improvements and earnings from the aluminum slug business, which we acquired in July of last year. We expected softness in the food can pack, we anticipate second half earnings in this segment will be below last year. The full year results are still forecasted to be better than the year ago.  To sum up, our people continue to step up and deliver. And while we have numerous projects moving forward around the globe, we are on track to deliver these on time and within budget, which will set us up nicely for 2012 and beyond.  With that, John, I'll pass it back to you.
John Hayes: Great. Thanks, Ray. A few comments on aerospace and then the outlook. Our aerospace and technologies business posted double-digit EBIT margins in the second quarter. Earnings increased primarily due to continued excellent program performance. Backlog ended the quarter just over $900 million.  Washington continues to be an interesting and challenging place to observe and conduct business. From a funding perspective, our 2011 programs and most of the 2012 projects are in good shape. While aerospace's capabilities are strategically important to our customer base and provide upside for the segment over the next couple of years, the goal of Ball's businesses are focused on delivering cost effective solutions and the highest quality service well in an environment where our aerospace customers are more focused than ever on best cost and best value.  In terms of program highlights, we successfully tested our prototype docking sensor during the May space shuttle mission, guiding space shuttle Endeavor to a docking operation with the International Space Station. NASA has identified this technology as critical for future space exploration missions. Now our funding remains -- risks remain, our people in aerospace are delivering on their commitments exceptionally well.  So in summary, our company and people are performing very well despite some external challenges, and we are bullish on the opportunities in front of us to further improve results. We will continue to deploy capital to enhance our diverse portfolio of businesses and return value to our shareholders. At the midway point of the year, we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of 10% to 15% earnings growth, and we expect second half performance will exceed that of last year's second half.  So with that, Lyn, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: On Brazil and kind of thinking back to the first quarter, I think the beer market there was weak. I think some of your customers attributed unfavorable weather down there. Do you think that what your -- you and the industry saw in the second quarter is inventory reduction related, just based on what happened in 1Q?
Raymond Seabrook: I think it's a number of things, Ghansham. It's -- they've talked to our guys in Brazil, it's been the wettest coldest winter ever kind of down there. So they -- the market -- the whole market in the second quarter was down 7%, 8%, believe or not, and that's kind of a first for a long time. So it was a combination of increased taxes on basically, beverages, beer and soft drinks, but primarily our business is beer there, so it hurt us. And we think that, that's pretty much washed out, and we expect to have a much better second half.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then switching to North America, obviously, your customers have pursued a strategy of price or volume, and just listening to the comments over the last couple of weeks or so, they may seem to be rethinking that, just given the weakened -- your spending environment in North America. Have you seen any sort of improvement in July or is that still too early?
Raymond Seabrook: I think it's a little early. Let's -- with -- John mentioned that, with Washington and all the uncertainty, is causing a lot of disruption in the Americas, let's face it. Until that gets straightened out, I think, just consumers are nervous, whether it's buying soft drinks or buying a new house or whatever it is, so I think it's just a little tough in all businesses in the Americas, until the U.S. gets its act together. But yes, we're seeing the mark, it's a little soft, it's been a little bit better through July for us, but it hasn't picked up to the volumes we'd like to see. Let's with the...
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: The first question I had is around capital deployment and the execution on the projects. As we think about 2012, it seems like it would be difficult for you to have the same level of activity, and if, parenthetically, spending, that you saw or seeing in 2011. On the other hand, you're executing well, so maybe that increases your appetite for the next project. How should we think about this equation, realizing it's a little bit early to be -- to guiding to free cash flow and CapEx for 2012?
John Hayes: George, when you think about our CapEx this year, it's not just in emerging markets and driven by growth. As I had mentioned in my comment, yes, we're doing everything in aerospace, we're doing some things in terms of specialty here in North America. I think in every one of our businesses, say, probably for food can. We have capital projects that, as you said, we are executing on very well. As you think about going into 2012, we are opportunity focused, and we're trying to drive it with our customers. We -- as we sit here today, I would not anticipate that we're going to have the wide variety of different capital projects going on, that as Ray mentioned, we continue to see opportunities in Asia, so that is an area of focus for us, for example.
George Staphos: So John, if I could, do you think that actually might mean lower spending next year where...
John Hayes: Yes, I think it could. How much lower is what we just don't know right now because opportunities pop up and we want to be responsive to those.
George Staphos: But it would also suggest that -- well, your priorities for the use of that excess cash wouldn't have -- wouldn't change on a going-forward basis, would it?
John Hayes: Absolutely not. In fact, what Scott said is we believe our company has created a lot of value over the years by returning it to shareholders, by making acquisitions and by investing in our business, and we look at those as 3 buckets as we go forward just like we have in the past.
George Staphos: Last question, I'll turn it over. On aerospace, I think you said, if I heard you correctly, that the backlog is now around $900 million, just under -- I recall from the last quarter is about $1 billion. If you could relay what the delta has been, I guess, you're starting to work on those projects and that's the reason why the backlog is declining. But if you could help me understand what the delta there is. And you mentioned the risk that M&A from what's going on in Washington, how would those actually materialize in your business? Would it mean a stretching out of the revenue on project work or could we see, if the wrong things happen, a reduction in your backlog as projects are canceled?
John Hayes: Well, yes. Your point is spot on, and the summer is debt ceiling in Washington. Our backlog is a funded backlog, and so you've seen a decline quarter-over-quarter because the government just hasn't been funding some of the longer-term things. And so as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that we believe 2011 and 2012 we're in pretty good shape on that, but until there's more clarity around what the government's priorities are going forward, I do think that there is a little bit of risk in the outer year's. I.e. going into '13 and beyond with some of the projects that we won. But as we sit here today, many of the projects that we won are very strategic and they have finite lives relative to replacements. And for that reason, we feel pretty good that we're in good shape relative to others.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I guess, I've asked this question, I think, the couple of quarters in a row, but any update on the Eastern European market in bev cans whether or not you're seeing any improvement there?
John Hayes: Well, this is John, I'll take the first crack. The short answer is yes, we are starting to see improvements there. I think In Eastern Europe, and that includes the Serbia region as well as, I think in the quarter, it was up around 11% or so. And so we are starting to see some improvement there. But recall back in the mid-2000s and even up until the financial crisis, we're not seeing the 30% growth that we had been seeing. But it is good, healthy, consistent growth.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just, I guess, one quick follow-up. With your comments on profitability being down in the back half in your food can business, I understand that there's going to be a late harvest this year, therefore, a shift from 3Q into 4Q most likely, but I get confused as to why overall for the back half profits would be down?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, it's primarily because some of our customers aren't planning as much product as they have. They're taking product out of the system, so we don't have as much planning in some of the fields as we normally do, but -- that's one of the reasons.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.
Chip Dillon: First question has to do with the China situation, Ray, you talked about the 35% growth. Could you talk about that in terms of how much is -- I assume is from -- some of it is from acquisitions and how that growth compares to the overall market?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, I think the market's up somewhere between -- the market's up around 15%, I think, year-to-date. We're up higher, and some of that's, obviously, our acquisition. We acquired a joint venture plant with 3 can lines, and so it's -- I think it might be the largest can plant in China. I'm not sure of that, I think it's certainly, but it's one of the largest. So that obviously contributes to our growth. But as we look at what's going on in China, as we talk to our customers, as we project the market, it's -- the beverage can market is relatively small in China on a relative basis. We got beer penetration at -- the cans are like 2%. And so it's going to continue to grow, and we are here, may capture our fair share of that. And that's exactly what we plan to do. We think we're lined up with some wonderful customers and we plan to, as I said, capture our share as that's progressing. So if you don't need a rocket scientist to figure, it's going to continue to increase, we just got to pick up our spots and make sure we've picked the bright spots. SO that's what we're trying to do, and that's what we will do.
Chip Dillon: And when you look at the Vietnam opportunity that you guys are pursuing right now, it seems like others have also targeted Vietnam, but it seems like one that had might be slowing back or backing off a little bit. Do you find, as a result, the market there is healthy and that the competitive situation there is constructive?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes. We're -- I'm very confident with our Vietnam operations. We have signed contracts for the volume. My guess is that line will be filled up pretty much, we get the plant, the plant started up and, -- it's -- so it's been a very strong market. We're -- again, we're just trying to pick up a little bit of our share and I don't see any issues for us in Vietnam. I just think we got to get the plant built and get it up and running. That's all.
John Hayes: To amplify on that from a consumer perspective. Consumer spending has continued the increases in Vietnam. The can is quickly becoming a preferred package there, so we're seeing can penetration continue to increase. And so you combine those 2 factors and the overall health of the end markets in Vietnam remain quite positive right now.
Chip Dillon: Got you. And then real quickly, and this might be a little off the wall, but I'd tell you the name if I could remember, but one of the industrial companies that one of my colleagues covers mentioned the other morning that the government sent them a paper check for $100 million, a payment that normally would have been wired. Are you seeing any changes in how the government pays you? Are they actually sending you checks when before they would wire you money?
John Hayes: Are you saying the U.S. Government?
Chip Dillon: The U.S. Government.
John Hayes: Yes. No, we haven't seen any changes if all that's happening.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: With volume's off to a slow start in North America bev, I just want to get a better sense of how operating rates are stacking up for your industry as well as for Ball, and do you think there's a need to take out some capacity later this year?
John Hayes: This is John. It's -- for us, as Ray said, year-to-date, we're up a couple of percent, and we had always said that as we entered into 2011 we'd expect to be up mid-single digits relative to the market, and we are. We've taken out a fair amount of capacity, 4 plants over the last couple of few years, and Torrance is coming down in the fourth quarter of this year. So from our operating rates, we're in pretty good shape here in North America, but we're also wise enough to constantly be monitoring those things. And we know longer term, if we need to do some things, we're going to have to take the tough decisions and do them. But as we sit here right now, we have no plans to be doing that.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And could you remind me if there is any sizable contracts up for renewal? I know, most of that got shored up last year, if I remember correctly.
Raymond Seabrook: This year?
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: This coming year, for 2012.
Raymond Seabrook: We do have one fairly sizable contract up for renewal in 2012.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: That's for North America, right?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes.
John Hayes: Yes, and that's for...
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you just talk about how you see these supply/demand dynamics evolving in Brazil for the next couple of years. It looks like so in the second quarter was soft, but there were some seasonal factors there, and then you're talking about growth in the back half of 5% to 7%, which I think this is slower than what it was in 2009 and 2010. And I think the capacity that's going in to the Brazilian market is somewhere in the low to -- or low-single digits double digits range. So are you concerned that there may be some more overcapacity that ends up happening in Brazil in that type of scenario?
Raymond Seabrook: Alex, this is Ray. I'm not overly concerned because remember our capacity is tied up with long-term contracts, so if there's overcapacity, no, it doesn't -- it's not affecting us because we are -- we have contacts that make sure it doesn't happen. So if you ask me what I -- if you ask me as a crystal ball for Brazil, I would say that for us, you're talking about, I don't see us building another plant immediately. I see us trying to get some more can lines in the plants we already have. I would say that you could see us maybe adding a can line a year for a couple of years, and then we'll see what happens. Remember, we still got the Olympics. We still got the World Cup coming to Brazil. There is still a lot stuff going on. The economy, there's low inflation, so we got to be careful of what we're doing here, but I would say, it's -- there's still some growth left and I would -- I could see us adding a couple of -- about a line a year, which is it 800 million cans.
John Hayes: And let's not forget that there is a fair amount of imports, as we said it in the prior calls. The fair amount of imports in 2010, and so there's a shortage going in, in 2011. So a decent chunk of this new capacity coming on is just to absorb what was already being demanded back in 2010.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That's helpful. And just on the European bev side, it looks like your volumes are pretty healthy. Are you seeing any impact from the recent macro flare up -- out in Europe on the demand trends here in July and then the start of the third quarter at all?
John Hayes: No, we're not. As you know, we are primarily focused on Western Europe and Eastern Europe. We don't do much in Southern Europe so where some of this decantation is occurring, we really don't do much of there, but even from where we look from the outside looking in, we don't see big changes going on there.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Dan Schniewind from AMI Asset Management.
Daniel Schniewind: It looks like you guys continue to improve from a bond holder standpoint, and it looks like you guys are -- your metrics look more like an investment-grade company than a high-yield company. Is there any internal interest in actually getting that upgrade? And have you guys been in contact with the rating agencies about that?
Scott Morrison: We talk to the rating agencies all the time. We have found that we can have a tremendous value and have a lot of flexibility with where we're rated right where we're at. We've always been able to raise capital at pretty competitive rates but it gives us a lot of flexibility to pursue acquisitions, to buy back our stocks, to invest in our existing businesses. So we're real happy right where we're at right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Just a few questions. I'm curious if you can comment on what you're seeing in general line cans, are you surprised to see some of the industry numbers? And maybe provide an update, if you could, on Neuman aluminum and some of your slug business?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, this Ray. Let's start with the slug business. Slugs worldwide are tight. I mean, fundamentally, is -- there's not any excess -- a lot of excess slug capacity. So as this market grows, we're going to have to consider adding some more slug capacity, I would say. So we're looking at various options. We're trying to improve our asset utilization of what we have, and we're making some investments in what we have to try to make that more efficient, so we're going to do that first. But slug capacity, not just in Europe or North America, everywhere, it's tight. So slug capacity is going to have to be added, so we're trying to figure that out. That's the first thing. General line, we don't really have a very big general line business, and when I think general line, I'm thinking, thin cans and things like that. We do have a very small general line business, but it's very, very small. So quite frankly, I haven't seen anything unbeknownst in that business, it's just sort of -- it's doing relatively well. But for us, it's very, very small. John, do you have anything to add to that?
John Hayes: No, I think that's a good summary. We generally are not in the general line business.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay. And just to clarify, your second half guidance, your food -- the food can business. How much of the decline year-over-year is related to drought conditions and what's going on with agriculture? I mean, is that really -- or is there something else that I'm missing?
Raymond Seabrook: It's not magic. We just -- the numbers are going to kind of roll off a little different than it did the last year. Our food can business is having another excellent, excellent year. If you look at year-to-date results, it's way, way ahead of last year. And some of that's there's various reasons for that. And as we look at -- as we talk to our customers and we look at what they expect, and we look at our quarters, as Scott said, we have 6 less days in the fourth quarter that's going to affect that business. So when we look at it, we're not going to do as well as we did last year, but we're still going to do significantly better than we did the year before. Just trying to give you a heads up that we're not going to do as much as last year for those reasons.
John Hayes: Yes, but let's put it in context. As Ray said that our food and household products business is doing quite well, and recall earlier this spring, late spring, early summer the whole Mississippi Valley was flooded. And so the plantings got in late, now it's been very hot. And so we're just being a little pragmatic relative to what our expectations of the harvest will be. And that's, in part, based on the facts that we can see, and in part, based on the conversations we're having with our customers. And so there's nothing strange going on, it's just we're taking a view on the harvest in the third and fourth quarter.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay. And lastly, if I could, looking at metal beverage Europe, looking at margins kind of in a year-over-year basis is like down 120 basis points. So I'd imagine some of that is just because of price causing margins to be lower on a reported basis, even though they might be more constant. But is there something else going on there or can help you us to understand that, that 120 basis point variance is what's impacting it?
John Hayes: By far, the biggest difference is raw material pass-through. I think if you look just at the LME [ph], I think it's up 25% year-over-year, and you know our cost pass through model, that puts -- as you see, our overall profitability is actually better. The margins are down in large part because the sales are inflated because of the pass-through positions. That is far and away the largest part of it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: A couple of additional ones. First, as we think about the recent repricing in tinplate over in Europe, were there any issues that you need to contend with as you manage your business? How did that go or how has it been going for you thus far?
John Hayes: We had no midyear price increases in steel in Europe.
George Staphos: Okay. So I guess it's going pretty well for you then. Secondly, in terms of free cash flow, Scott, do you think about -- maybe this year is a somewhat depressed year because of the projects and next year, maybe they're more normalized. If you consider the future, what kind of growth rate do you think you can have on your free cash flow over a 3- to 5-year period? And what do you think the biggest drivers of that are?
Scott Morrison: Well, I think as you -- as we talked about, we've got quite a bit of growth CapEx happening this year. A number of those projects that John talked about are kind of onetime impacts to this year. We expect to still see growth in places like Brazil and China longer-term, but frankly, once you put a plant in, that's the big throw, and then when you add additional lines, it's not a big a throw. We see the CapEx even with continued growth in those markets to come down quite a bit. And all the capital we're spending, all of those projects have nice returns and start flowing cash right away. We expect our free cash flow number to be, even back up this year, the $300 million plus of growth of CapEx. And we expect the earnings to get to another level based on at all these new projects, so we see nice growth over the next few years. With our balance sheet and our capital structure right where we want it gives us a lot of flexibility to return value to shareholders.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: I wondered if you could just update us on that Aluminum Aerosol business and what kind of growth rates you're seeing for sort of the market and then your own business there?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, this is Ray. The -- our growth rates, they're quite frankly, have been, even -- we knew it was a growth business, but it's been -- and quite a bit better than even we had forecasted when we put the acquisition model together. We're growing -- and we've got growth rates year-to-date in excess of 20%, and I think the second quarter, it was like 18%. So we're -- it's been very strong for us. John, I don't know -- the market I don't know.
John Hayes: Yes, it varies ,obviously by region. South America continues to be quite strong, Europe continues to be quite strong. I think North America, like most of the end markets in the touch -- consumer here in North America, it's been a touch soft, but we continue to see good growth prospects in that business, generally speaking.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, your footprint right now is just in Europe and in North America?
John Hayes: That is correct.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan.
Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just wanted to follow up one more question in Brazil. As a contingency plan, I guess, in the event that the volumes aren't what you're expecting, the 5% to 7% in the second half, if it's something closer to flat or even down, is there anything that you would change about what you're doing down there or are you comfortable with the contracts such that it's locked and loaded in terms of 100% of your volumes or just how would you manage something like that?
Raymond Seabrook: The best way I can describe it without going into massive detail, it's locked and loaded.
Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then, just one quick question on the minority interest, could you remind us, obviously, the earnings get, if they get hit on the segment, and they probably get hit on the minority interest line, but just remind us what drives the minority interest line?
Scott Morrison: It's the 40% of Brazil that we don't own.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up question, from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: One last question around capacity and 12-ounce in the states. Two parts to it. I think last call we talked a little bit about the longer-term optionality you might have, if you need, on the one hand, to take out some 12-ounce capacity, you might be able to utilize that on the food part of the house. Is there any additional thinking as regards to the potential for that to occur in the next 2 to 3 years? And as you think about your contracts for 2012, I think you mentioned earlier that there's business that's up for renewal, I guess, at the end of this year into 2012. I just want to confirm that, and if you would, kind of size it.
Raymond Seabrook: Yes. We -- there's really nothing going on this year. We have some things we're negotiating but there's nothing impacting this year. We do have some businesses up at the end of 2012. So we'll have to negotiate in 2012.
John Hayes: Yes. And George, about your question, really about redeployment of equipment. We have a system around the world that we can do many different things, and this specific answer your question, could we -- are we considering moving some beverage can into food can? We don't have any specific plans on the table, but we certainly know if we want to do something like that, where we want to it, how we want to do it and the cost of which. The other benefit that we have is the ability to take some of our equipment here in North America, if we have to, and deploy it in other parts of the world. We have been doing that, as Ray had mentioned, in terms of up-speeding doing some other things in Asia. We have some levers to pull on that, that gives us, in a way, a capital avoidance as we continue to grow in some of these emerging markets. So that's one of the benefits of having the system that we do. And so we are looking at those types of things. It's a good point.
George Staphos: As I recall, I think Milwaukee was one of the facilities where you had done this, and maybe, perhaps Columbus. But if you could remind me, if you've audited the returns on these types of conversions from bev to food, have they actually met your initial expectations or were they off a bit one way or another?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, as you might imagine, George, the initial answer is in the beginning, they did not meet our initial expectations, but as you said, now they are.
John Hayes: Yes, in fact, I think they're even exceeding our expectations today. So -- but yes, you're right, it's actually just to clarify, it's Milwaukee and Finley is where we did those a dozen years ago or so. And they're performing quite nicely.
George Staphos: I should have remembered Finley. Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Hayes, it appears at this time, that there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to you.
John Hayes: Okay, well, thank you, all, very much. Just one housekeeping item. We are planning on having an investor field trip out here in Colorado. The dates will be October 10 and 11, and please contact Ann Scott to register for the event. Other than that, thank you very much for participating, and we look forward to talking to you all 3 months from now. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 28, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
John Hayes: Thank you, Edison, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's first quarter results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other SEC filings as well as the company's news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today are Ray Seabrook, Chief Operating Officer of Global Packaging; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott will discuss our progress from a financial point of view, and Ray will follow up with details about the progress we are making in our packaging operations. I'll close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. As mentioned in our press release, Ball reported very strong first quarter results due largely to strong volume growth in our Global Beverage Can businesses and strong operating performance across all of our Packaging businesses; excellent program performance in our Aerospace business; continued double-digit growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil; benefit from our prior actions to better match our supply with market demand here in North America; and better-than-anticipated performance from our recent M&A activity.  In addition to our strong results in the quarter, we also closed on the Aerocan acquisition. We successfully started up beverage can lines in Tres Rios, Brazil and Belgrade, Serbia, began construction on a new plant in Alagoinhas, Brazil and formed a joint venture in Vietnam.  Our Aerospace business won additional work, ramped up hiring for new programs and increased quarter-end backlog to more than $1 billion. As you can see, it's a busy and exciting time to be at Ball Corporation.  Recall that our strategy revolves around maximizing the value of our existing businesses, broadening our geographic reach, aligning ourselves with winning customers and markets, expanding into new products and capabilities and lastly, leveraging our technology in new product development abilities. And over the past period of time, we've been successfully executing on just that.  Our announcement earlier in the quarter of realigning our 12-ounce in specialty beverage can capacity in the U.S. sets our North American Beverage Can business up well for the balance of the year and beyond. The new capacity in Eastern Europe, Brazil, China and Southeast Asia allows us to participate in strong growth now and in the future. Our slug and extruded aluminum acquisitions position us well for what we believe are good global growth opportunities and have hit the ground running in terms of performance. And our new product development activities continue to pay dividends, with new investments in our Alumi-Tek bottle technology and our specialty can capabilities. In fact, our new products in specialty can growth around the world is up approximately 30% year-over-year, and our expectation is that this will continue. All of this would not be possible without our talented and dedicated people who take true ownership in all that we do on a daily basis.  So in summary, we have good momentum in our business as we enter the seasonally strong summer season, and our investments in the future, that Ray will discuss, tee us up well in the future.  With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.58 versus last year's $0.43. The following factors contributed to improved results: growth in and consolidation of our majority-owned Brazilian joint venture, as the first quarter of Brazil is seasonally strong; volume improvements and excellent operating performance on our Global Metal Packaging businesses; inventory holding gains in our Food and Household segment added a few cents in the quarter; exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business; a lower share count; and 6 additional accounting days in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. Since there are still only 365 days in the year, this means there'll be 6 fewer accounting days in the fourth quarter of 2011. These positive factors were partially offset by a year-over-year increase in corporate undistributed, primarily due to higher incentive accruals, an increase in the effective tax rate and higher interest expense. The euro had essentially no impact to earnings in the quarter. Also in the quarter, the company recorded a $6.4 million after-tax charge or $0.04 per diluted share for the closure of our Torrance, California beverage container facility.  For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. As an update to the 2011 financial metrics provided on our January call, we anticipate full year interest expense to be closer to $185 million, up $5 million over previous estimates due to the recent strengthening of the euro.  With the growing contribution of earnings from our Beverage Americas segment, our full year effective tax rate will now be closer to 32%, up from the prior indication of 31%.  As indicated in January, 2011 CapEx will be approximately $500 million. Each of these CapEx projects exceeds our after-tax investment hurdle within 3 years, and Ray will provide an update on these projects in a minute. Given our strong performance, we expect corporate undistributed to run in the low $70 millions for the full year as -- versus the low 60s that I mentioned on the January call. We continue to expect 2011 free cash flow of at least $400 million, with the majority of the free cash flow going to share repurchases.  In the quarter, we acquired a net $150 million of stock. And as of today's call, we've acquired approximately a net $180 million of stocks since the beginning of the year.  At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion, up slightly due to the Aerocan acquisition and cash being oriented to share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown.  Our balance sheet is solid, our capital structure is highly competitive and the operations are providing high-quality results and strong cash flow. We will continue our long-standing approach to balance capital deployment and consistently return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.
Raymond Seabrook: Thanks, Scott. This is an exciting time to be serving the company as the Global Packaging COO. As John said, we have a lot going on, and it's all really good. It's also reassuring to me to see firsthand that we have a lot of outstanding, dedicated people that work for our company.  Metal Beverage, America and Asia segment reported considerably higher earnings for the quarter, due mainly to the inclusion of Brazil earnings, which were not in the first quarter 2010 results, and higher sales volumes in all geographic areas. Excluding the effect of 6 additional days in the quarter, as Scott talked about, normalized sales volumes in North America were up mid-single-digits and normalized sales volumes were up in Brazil and China more than 15%.  We continue to see earnings growth opportunities in North America, as we lower our cost structure, improve our manufacturing footprint and develop innovative products like the Alumi-Tek bottle. All of our major capital projects are on time and within budget.  The relocation of a 12-ounce can line to Whitby, Ontario from Torrance, California is scheduled to start up by mid-May. A new 16-, 24-ounce swing line will be installed and running in our Fort Worth plant by September, and the Torrance plant is scheduled for closure in the fourth quarter. All of these activities will contribute to second half and future year's results. Beverage Can growth continued strong in both Brazil and China. And to keep pace, we have announced plans to build a new beverage can plant in Alagoinhas, Brazil. We are also replacing an existing beverage can plant in Qingdao, China, with a much larger, more modern plant. We expect to be making commercial cans by the end of 2011 in Qingdao and in early 2012 in Alagoinhas. Turning to Europe, our acquisition of Ball Aerocan on January 18th of this year is off to an excellent start. Sales and earnings exceeded the acquisitions plan in the quarter, and sales volumes in this product line are up over 20% year-over-year.  Metal Beverage, Europe's normalized sales volumes are also up mid-single-digits in the first quarter, and the sale of beverage cans in Germany continues to grow. We foresee German beverage can growth in the range of 50% this year. Market growth continues, and we have just finished the installation of a second can line in our Belgrade, Serbia plant and our supply/demand balance in Europe remains very tight. The Metal Food and Household Product results in the quarter benefited from volume gains in aerosol containers, earnings from the aluminum slug business we acquired in mid-2010 and some small inventory gains, as Scott talked about. Normalized food can volumes were a little soft in the first quarter, but manufacturing performance in this sector was excellent.  To sum up, our operations are performing well. We are seeing increased demand in our businesses throughout the world, and we are investing in our operations for continued growth.  With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.
John Hayes: Thanks, Ray. A few comments on Aerospace and then, the outlook. Our Aerospace and Technologies business reported near double-digit EBIT margins in the first quarter. Earnings increased primarily due to continued excellent program performance. Backlog, as I said, ended the quarter at more than $1 billion. Under the U.S. government's continuing resolution, only a few of our programs are experiencing funding issues, and the outlook in total is positive for the remainder of 2012 -- or, excuse me, 2011. Multiyear programs and associated hiring are ramping up, and we plan to expand our satellite manufacturing building later on this year to provide the necessary infrastructure to execute on these new wins.  We're keeping a close eye on the activities in Washington, and we believe our ability to deliver value-based capabilities in terms of cost, quality and schedule that are strategically important to our customer base, sets us up well for the next couple of years. In summary, Ball Corporation's improved year-to-date performance is due to the execution of our strategy. We're maximizing our returns in cash flow in mature markets, broadening our product portfolio, growing in emerging markets and providing technology and innovation to our customers. And our shareholders are benefiting from our customer-led focus, tight discipline and balanced approach to deploying capital, as Scott said.  We fully expect to generate 2011 results in excess of those in 2010, and we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of 10% to 15% earnings growth per year.  With that, Edison, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: Ray, good to hear you on the call again. I guess the first question I had, could you go back on the -- and repeat what the timing of the startups on the replacement plant in Qingdao and the new plant in Brazil are? And to the extent possible, can you remind us or provide what the customer base is for each and remind us on the contract's presell nature, et cetera, if possible?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, Qingdao, we need cans by December. So we expect that to be starting up probably mid- to late December. So that's Qingdao. Alagoinhas is, probably it's March, a March startup for that plant. The main customer base for both plants is beer. We have, I think, I believe, a 7-year contract in Brazil, and we have contracts that support the Qingdao plant. Did I answer all the questions or I miss one?
George Staphos: And I'm guessing that the contract is pretty much -- or the volume you anticipate is pretty much all acquired from the key customers, there is not any [indiscernible] to come?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, it's all sold out.
George Staphos: The second question I had relates to the European beverage can market. I think you mentioned that you are sold out. Have you experienced, nonetheless, any price compression or margin compression in any of the regions? Some of the peers who reported thus far suggested there were some pockets of price competition during the quarter and -- for the outlook for 2011?
Raymond Seabrook: You know, we are a competitive industry, so there's always competition. We do remain tight. I believe, as they say, if things go according to plan, we may need to add more capacity in Europe if the market continues to grow. If the price we have -- we have experienced some price issues, and we've walked away from some business on price. So there's no use trying to get business that -- we're filling up our capacity with our best business.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: It looks like your big beer customers in North America seem to have raised prices on their subpremium brands, which has driven some level of premiumization, benefiting glass to some extent at the expense of cans. And I think the CMI numbers support that for the first quarter anyway. Can you touch on what you saw in 1Q specific to beer and -- just given your large exposure towards the subcategory?
John Hayes: Ghansham, this is John. I'll take that. Recall over the past couple of years, the share of the cans as a percentage of the packaging has gone up from, call it, 48% to 52%, so we've been a beneficiary relative to other substrates. I think the first quarter, it was a little bit soft, but not abnormally soft. I think it was down about 1% or so. But let's remember, that's January through March. It's not the time that people are going to be drinking beer. Many of our customers have been focusing on value over volume. I think the conversations we've been having with them suggest that they are very much focused on trying to grow their brands. Yes, they have created a less of a differential between the premium and subpremium, but we're still pretty constructive on what's going on in the beer industry for the can.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And just switching to soft drinks, can you just update us on your thoughts on what we should expect going forward, particularly given that your customers are digesting some pretty heavy raw material increases in what's inside the can, not just the can itself. And I'm curious as to whether you think they cut back on promotional spending just to offset some of that margin pressure.
John Hayes: I don't think I know the answer to that, Ghansham. Here's what I can tell you, that we have, obviously, we did a fairly big market share in the U.S., and so we deal with everybody. And what we're seeing is different customers doing different things. We have some customers that are, quite frankly, fairly aggressive in the U.S. and we have some that are less. So it's a bit of a mixed bag.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And just one final one, if I could. There's been some talk about Russia potentially banning beer or PET [polyethylene terephthalate], which could occur by '13. I know you previously had plans for a plant in the country, can you just sort of update us on that?
John Hayes: Well, we still [indiscernible] in Russia, and if it's good economics for us to [indiscernible] we will. We've not announced anything yet because we haven't found the right entry point relative to customers and equipment where we can make a decent return. Your mention about PET, that is -- our understanding, is that it's not gone into law yet but it is sort of being banned [indiscernible], which is the government body in Russia. So we'll see how that develops, and that could bring a positive outcome for the industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: It's actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. All of our questions have been answered, but we just had a quick one. Is there any kind of a ballpark estimate you might have on America's beverage? Especially in North America, you mentioned mid-single-digit growth. What percentage of that is coming from maybe contract wins or kind of new business this year?
John Hayes: Well, recall over the last 12 days to 18 months, we've talked about in 2010, we're going to be taking a step down and beginning back in 2011, back to the 2008, 2009 levels. That's exactly where we are right now. And what that means on a year-over-year basis is, as we said, mid-single-digits increases over 2010. We're entering that busy summer selling season, and so we have only had a first quarter under our belt, but we expect exactly what we said in January to be occurring through 2011.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And I think last quarter, I commented that you had some big shoes to fill, but given what you guys are doing thus far, it seems like you're stepping into them pretty well.
John Hayes: Appreciate that, but one quarter doesn't a year or a decade make. But as we said in January...
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Well, that's what I'd like to hear.
John Hayes: Yes, we have a lot of -- as we said in January, and we say now, we have good momentum in our business. We have people focused. We're very much focused on the execution of our capital projects and touch wood, it is only the end of April right now, but things are going well with the company.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Well that's what I like to hear, that you're still going at it. So I do have a couple questions for you. First, let's talk for a second about the Aerospace side of the business. If memory serves, that's almost a record backlog, I believe. How does that start to get monetized through, as we look over the next 12 to 24 months? Can that get back to kind of record EBIT levels here, or how should we think about that?
John Hayes: Well, recall back in August of last year, we've really won 4 big programs in the satellite side of the business. Some of them are classified so we can't talk about them, but these are multiyear programs. And what we said is, as they begin to ramp up in 2011, we'll get some benefit. But really, as we go into '12 and '13, that's where it will come in. The only caution I'll note relative to that is that the funding at the U.S. government level is still unclear. We're operating under a continuing resolution right now. We've got that ceiling issues. And until the September timeframe, when the 2000 -- fiscal 2012 budget is put into place, we won't have complete -- we won't have better visibilities than we do now. What I will tell you, and I said in my prepared remarks, is that, that the wins that we have are very strategic for our customer base, and we believe that one of the reasons that we won some of this business is because we have shown an ability to deliver good value, good quality on a good timeline at a low cost. So it sets us up nicely as we go into 2012 and '13.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question for -- as you look at the metal gains you had over the quarter, is there is there a way you can help us to want to quantify those so we can get a sense of trajectory here into 2Q, 3Q? Or will some of those also continue into 2Q as well?
Scott Morrison: No, I mentioned that in the Food and Household segment, we had just a few cents. It wasn't a huge impact. And going forward, it really is nothing. So it shouldn't affect the numbers as we look forward throughout the rest of the year.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then in that Metal Food Household section, it did take -- the European Bev [beverage] section, it did take a big step up. And I'm assuming that a chunk of that is Aerocan. Could you maybe give us a sense as to what the revenue and EBIT contribution were relating that business?
Raymond Seabrook: You want me to do that, Scott?
Scott Morrison: Yes, go ahead, Ray.
Raymond Seabrook: The revenue is about $100 million. I'm talking U.S. dollars now. Of course, they're running that business in euros, but $100 million is the revenue and, call it, $7 million is the contribution.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Is it possible we get a little bit of color on what might have gone on in the first quarter in terms of just North American food can volumes? I mean your numbers sounded like they were pretty much down in line with the industry, but it seems like a pretty big drop for a relatively stable business?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes. We're still looking at that. Our volume probably, normalized, we're down probably in the neighborhood of 4% on the food side, and they were up 5% or 6% in aerosol. So -- and they're still soft, as we speak. Some of it is timing, I think. Some of it -- the steel guys have raised the prices on steel to a point where I think some of our -- there's still -- our customers are sitting on some inventories they're trying to get rid of before they pull the can. Remember, this is a very seasonal business. Just because they haven't pulled them now, it doesn't mean it's not going to be a good tax. So I'm not sure that's totally what you're looking for, but it has been a little soft year-to-today, but we expect it to pick up when some of our customer's inventories are pulled down.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And a couple questions on Brazil. Can you qualify the impact from the benefit from increasing your position in the joint venture in Brazil?
John Hayes: Yes, maybe this, I'll take it first. And then, Scott, you can comment. Remember, what we did is we went from a 50-50 unconsolidated joint venture to a 60% consolidated joint venture. So when you look at not only the contribution at the EBIT line, but also the equity line last year and the noncontrolling interest line this year and netting them, we really only have a slight improvement given the 10% increase in ownership. I think what you're seeing also, though, is the benefit of the growth in Brazil, that the business is performing well. And Scott, do you have anything?
Scott Morrison: No, that's it. I mean, going forward, you'll see the 40% that we don't own coming out in noncontrolling interest.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And do you have a sense just kind of based on the first quarter of by sort of how Brazilian volumes are doing this year's, just for the sort of a market as a whole?
John Hayes: Yes, I think the market is sort of up 12%, 13%. We're up little higher than that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Crédit Suisse.
Chip Dillon: I probably missed this, but could you just again verify the volume in beverage cans in Europe, what the change was, and if you could isolate what it would've been without the improvement in Germany?
Raymond Seabrook: I don't know if I can isolate without the improvement in Germany, but I would tell you that beverage can -- our beverage can volumes are up 4% in Europe in the first quarter of year.
Scott Morrison: Yes. Let's recall also in Germany, we've had some good improvement there, but it's also very small based. And so yes, it was a portion of the growth that Ray just mentioned, but certainly wasn't all of it by any stretch.
Chip Dillon: Got you. And then in terms of the Aerocan acquisition you closed on last year, my understanding is that this business was, I don't want to say left for dead, but was not performing well under its previous owner like 5 or 6 years ago. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about how -- what turned that around, what the market changes have been that provide acceptance for their particular technologies, and sort of how you -- where you expect that business to size at, say 3 to 5 years by now, whether it's organic or through acquisitions?
John Hayes: This is John. Maybe I'll take the first crack, and then turn it over to Ray. Recall in January, we talked a bit about this. Five years ago, it was an underperforming business in a larger conglomerate. And they had several facilities that were losing money. They had some accounting issues in certain plants. And they ultimately LBO-ed [leveraged buyout] it with the local management, and local management did a wonderful job of cleaning things up. They closed the facility in Spain. They fixed the plant in France. They significantly expanded their Eastern European presence. And they were doing this all at the time when the market started improving from a demand point of view. And so as we look at the acquisition, it was a very well-run business with some good growth potential, some embedded capability from not only a technology point of view, but from a fixed cost absorption, as you add incremental capacity in the Eastern European facility. And so it's all good, and maybe, Ray, if you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing now as we go forward.
Raymond Seabrook: Yes. I mean basically, we just approved some more capital. We're installing another line in the facility that John has talked about. And quite frankly, we're sold out in that business. And I told you, year-over-year volumes are up 20% in the first quarter. We continue to see growth not only in Europe but worldwide in that business. So we're looking to see what we can do to continue to expedite our look at that business. I did misspeak once before, what I said was, we had $100 million of sales in the first quarter, We're like $40 million. I picked the wrong number, but it's more like $40 million of sales and $7 million with EBIT.
John Hayes: Yes. But as we go forward, just to give context, the global aerosol -- aluminum aerosol market is approximately 6 billion units. It depends on how you look at it, but go with us on that. Europe's about half of that, a little bit less, but about half of that. We've got a 20% share. The growth rates in Europe are quite strong right now. This is a lot about beauty and other things like that. It's not about paint, it's not about general line. And we're sourcing good growth there. There's opportunities in North America as we said before, opportunities in South America, where the strongest growth is probably occurring down in South America. So we're -- and even in Asia, there's good growth opportunity. So we got into this business thinking that we have some capabilities to provide to the business. It has some capabilities that will help -- we can help to leverage as we look in other places, and that's exactly what we're attempting to do here.
Chip Dillon: And then one quick follow-up. As we look around the world, the only place that I know of, and you may know of others, John and Ray, where you see, in essence, new entrants into beverage cans, there's, I believe, a Chinese company in Vietnam that is building a plant that I believe is based on steel as opposed to aluminum. And would you say that's sort of a one-off situation or do you see competitors coming in?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, the one you're talking about, Vietnam, that's an announced plan. I'm not sure they're really going to build it, they announced they're going to do it, but I don't know if they're actually going to do it. There are -- we have competitors. We tend to run into the same competitors worldwide. We have -- when we look at -- I look at the world market, we -- in beverage cans, we have more competitors in Asia than anywhere else. If you look at Asia, there are more competitors seems to be in Asia. We tend to run into the same probably 4 competitors, 3 or 4 competitors, pretty much the rest of the world. And you might have a strike here or there, but I would say the most competitors we see are in Asia.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just wanted to follow up a bit on Brazil and how you see the supply and demand dynamic evolving in Brazil over the next couple of years, given both your capacity expansion and what you're seeing with some of your competitors?
Raymond Seabrook: The market, the beer picking up -- a lot of it has to do with beer. I think beer penetration is still in sort of the low 30%. When you look at developed markets, it usually gets to 50-ish. We've continued to see growth. They've got the World Cup and the Olympics is coming to Brazil. There is inflation. They've tried to slow the economy a little bit. They put some taxes on some things. So I don't think it's the a bit out of balance, but I think Brazil's pretty much still sold out on cans. You've heard all our competitors, we announced expansion, but it's really to fill the growth there. And we're trying not to put capacity in unless we know exactly where it's going. And we're not just building something for the sake of building it. So I continue to see growth in Brazil. I think the next 3 or 4 or 5 years will still be reasonably strong. I think that we'll take our fair share of the growth as well as our competitors. And I see Brazil as a good place to be doing business right now.
John Hayes: Let's not forget, in context, for 2010, it was short 1.5 billion to 2 billion cans that were imported from other regions. So they're starting in a hole going in 2011, a big hole. And as Ray said, we continue to see strong industry growth there. And on a base of, I'll call it, 18 billion plus or minus, you can do the math there, that's 3 billion or 4 billion cans that are needed in 2011 that weren't being supplied locally in 2010. So as you think about that and extrapolate, and given the embedded growth that we believe related to some of the things Ray mentioned, we think the prospects over the next couple of years are very constructive. Now having said that, we also are very cognizant of what we're doing in making sure that our contracts are tied up, and that we're not over building relative to demand that we see from our customer base.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And just on that, in terms of the contracts. The contracts essentially guaranteed such that if the customer chooses then not to build their facility, do you get some remuneration for your investment or is it essentially, you then just have to do what you did with the Poland plant and ultimately not start it up and relocated somewhere else?
John Hayes: Suffice to say -- we're not going to get into the specifics of our contracts, but suffice to say that we feel confident that we have the necessary provisions in place to adequately protect the risk management of these contracts.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Congratulations on the strong quarter. Ray, welcome back to the call. I wanted to ask, if I could, operationally, can you talk more about Belgrade, Serbia, Tres Rios, how is it performing versus expectations? Maybe remind us what kind of learning curve you'd expect and whether there was any kind of start-up cost that was incurred in the quarter and how we should think about learning curve going forward.
Raymond Seabrook: You mentioned Tres Rios, the startup in our Brazilian operations has been probably some of the best I've seen in my whole career. I mean, these plants we put in, I think we've spent a lot of money to put them in and I guess it showed when we start them up, because they just started up impeccably. I would say, that the startups in Brazil, I would say, have been the best we've ever had. They just started up, and we're making quality cans, a lot of them, right off the bat. We just recently installed that line in Serbia. I think it made its first cans a couple of weeks ago. So we're kind of -- we're still in the startup phase. So it's just really still starting up, but we're not expecting any difficulties. And touch wood, we've been real fortunate in the last few years that our start-ups had gone probably better than expected.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And in terms of learning curve, do you think Serbia could be up and going full in 6 to 9 months?
John Hayes: I think we'll be making -- no, I think, yes, well, as I said, capacity is tight in Europe. I need cans this year. I need cans by mid-May out of Serbia. So were going to be, as they said, our supply demand in Europe is too tight. I need those cans this year. It's going to be producing quality commercial cans mid-May and it's going to be running flat out pretty quickly here.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay. I'm curious on some of the growth in Brazil. Maybe, John, if you could help us understand the organic growth versus the share gains, as you see some of the trade up from a return to bottle market into more of a one-way, a package market? If you were to think about bifurcating the demand growth, how would you do that?
John Hayes: Well, I think when you look at overall literage of beer and soft drink, that continues to go strong and a lot of it is growing because it's not necessarily in the Rio areas and Sao Paolo areas, although that's growing nicely, but you're seeing it in the north, you're seeing it in the Northeast, and some of the more developing areas within Brazil. As we said, a lot of infrastructure is going in those areas. For example, the World Cup, they're going to be in 8 different cities. So it's not just in Rio or Sao Paolo, so that's driving it. And you combine that with a package share penetration, as Ray said, in the mid 30's. And we think there's some upward mobility, it's going to provide some additional acceleration of the beverage can over the next couple of years. Do we expect it to last forever? No, probably not. But certainly over the next few years, given the infrastructure build and the dynamics we just talked about, we think there's some good runway there.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, back in the U.S., I'm curious if you can talk about -- relatively small market, but the microbrews and the trends you're seeing there, both in terms of pack types, growth rates, any color you can offer?
John Hayes: Yes. The craft beer market has been certainly a bright spot in terms of volume relative to, not only us, but the overall beer category. It's the fastest growing segment within the beer category. Cans, 5 years ago, were effectively nothing in that segment, and they are growing very, very strong. And as it takes hold with some of the smaller ones, the question remains is, will it start to take hold with some of the largest -- larger craft beer makers, and I guess all I'd say is stay tuned on that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just a quick question. You mentioned how in Asia, some of your competitors are generally smaller. When they do add capacity, are they locking up long-term contracts and are they setting it up in a similar fashion as well?
Raymond Seabrook: I don't know the answer to that. As they say, I think some of our competitors are. I don't think they all are. I think that the -- you've got to remember, some of our competitors are state-owned companies in China. They're owned by the government. So I think they do, sometimes, things a little differently than we do, quite frankly. And I think that our worldwide competitors probably do things more similar to what we do. But China, just to give you a sense, we are importing cans into China. We are sold out as we speak. And so that's why I said I need that capacity in Qingdao by December. So we got -- the market is increasing in China. There's -- I think the beer penetration is at 4% or something like that. So you can see if that moves up a little bit, you're going to need more can plants in China. So we're looking at that. We're studying that. We're making sure that we get our fair share of whatever is happening over there. So -- but China tends to not necessarily work exactly like everything -- more the rest of the world, because we have more competitors there that do things maybe a little differently than we do.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And just for modeling purposes, your Americas Beverage segment, obviously, you're seeing a nice lift from Brazil from the can consolidation and some of your investments are flowing through more fully. Should we expect margins to be pretty stable across-the-board throughout the quarters now?
John Hayes: Well, we always have seasonal upticks in the second and third quarter of North America, when we get the volume upticks, the margins look a little bit better. But until we get a full year of Brazil in our numbers, it's going to dampen the seasonality that we've had in the past, because their busy time is the first and fourth quarters and our visit time is the second and third quarters. So it should bring the margins a little bit closer over time, but you got to get a full year before that really starts to happen.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So you should still see a modest step-up of sorts in 2Q and 3Q?
John Hayes: Yes, because that's the busiest time and the U.S. business is much larger than the Brazilian business.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Just to clarify on your beverage cans, the 4% volume growth, was that also adjusted for the 6 extra days during the quarter?
Raymond Seabrook: That was adjusted. If you didn't adjust it, it would look more like 10% or 11%.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay, fair enough. And also, a follow-up question on Brazil. Do you have, next year, any meaningful contracts coming up for renewal in Brazil next year? I was kind of thinking about -- I know you've kind of locked up some of the new capacity you've added, but wondered kind of some of the existing contracts that are out there to sort of how those come up?
Raymond Seabrook: We have one contract that's coming up at the end of '11 that we're negotiating right now. I'm not expecting any issues. It represents probably 20% of revenues, 15% to 20%.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then also on the, I guess, Food Can business with the -- any thoughts on this on productivity? I know with the Richmond, Canada closure last year. Can you update us on any of that, where cost savings there will start accruing or if you saw some of that benefit already in the first quarter.
Raymond Seabrook: No, we haven't seen the benefit. We are in the process of relocating their equipment as we speak. A lot of those cans that we used in this year's pack have already been made. They were made in Richmond. And you won't see the benefit of that probably until next year.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay. Final question. Certainly, the euro, from where we're at today, certainly it looks like it's going to be a nice tailwind in, starting in the second quarter here. Are there any hedges that you have out there that would impact how we think about FX and also, I want to get your guys' thoughts on view on updates and just how you think about hedging in general right here at current exchange rates?
Scott Morrison: Well, I mentioned in the first quarter, the euro essentially had no impact year-over-year. But as we sit here now at 147 and moving higher, obviously, we'll get the benefit of that as we move through the year. We do put hedges in place, but we tend to use things where we have upside and protect downside. And so whatever the euro ends up being, we should translate it fairly close to that number, even taking into account our hedges. But we put downside protection in below certain numbers, and we're well above those numbers right now. So we should get the benefit on that side, but that's also pushing up the interest expense a little bit and the debt that we have over in Europe, it will push it up a little bit.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Congrats again on a strong quarter. I wanted to circle back on the specialty can growth. I think you'd mentioned earlier that, I think you quoted 30% global growth. Can you just provide a little bit of color in terms of the regional breakdown and maybe certain regions where that contributed to that growth?
John Hayes: I don't have that in front of me, but we are seeing strong specialty growth. Ray mentioned, the 16- and 24-ounce particularly, but even our new 7.5-ounce can size here in North America. And down in Brazil, we have the sleek can that's growing nicely. And then even in Europe, whether its 15 cl or going up to 568 cl. I think brand owners are looking at trying to differentiate their brands and position their brands relative to being a little bit more distinguished to the consumer. And we, given that we have a large -- relatively large proportion of our output that has a capability of becoming specialty, we're benefiting from that.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: And can you still, John, get, I guess, paid for that kind of innovation? And in terms of the margins, I know in recent years, up to say 2 or 3 years ago, before more capacity was allocated to this segment, that the margins, at least one of your competitors have quoted, it was up to 3x in conventional can. And not to pin you down on the exact numbers, but is there still a nice kind of premium margin for specialty relative to conventional?
John Hayes: Well, by definition, there should be, because we're investing in it. And if you want to get an appropriate return on investment, you ought to be getting better than just the steady-state.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Okay, but is that true in Europe, I mean today?
John Hayes: Yes. I think it's generally true wherever we are.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And Coming back, did you say on Aerocan, it was EUR 7 million of EBIT on EUR 40 million of sales?
Scott Morrison: We said it was $40 million of U.S. sales and $7 million of EBIT, approximately.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Do you guys see -- your EVA model, is that -- is this deal going to be accretive by, like, the second year or maybe even the first year?
Scott Morrison: It's accretive now.
Scott Morrison: As I said in my prepared remarks, we really hit the ground running with all of our M&A activity relative to our expectations, and the folks over in the Aerocan business, the folks in the Neuman -- the former Neuman Aluminum business, are doing a great job, and we're quite excited about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Khoshaba with KSA Capital.
Daniel Khoshaba - KSA: Just looking at some of your recent competitors and their increase in capital expenditures, and your increase in capital expenditures, the whole industry's done a great job investing and making these plans come on time and getting great returns. But I was thinking back, after looking at these numbers, that for the last 20 years, I think you guys would probably agree, the industry benefited during times when capital expenditures were kind of coming in and operating rates were tight, and it allowed you to have pricing, and wonderful things happened in terms of performance and stock prices and all those things. And now all of a sudden, we're seeing CapEx -- for the entire industry, not just you guys, for everybody -- and, again, I think the industry structure's a lot different. But you have to be wondering, or at least thinking, what's different this time so that the increase in CapEx that is happening throughout the industry doesn't lead to what it led to back in the -- I guess it would have been the mid-1990s probably, right? In terms of returns. So how do you think about that, and when will you know? And I guess you never really know, but you get my point.
John Hayes: Yes. Dan, let me just quickly walk through. Number one -- and I'll speak to our capital obviously, we're a very different business than we were back then. And the capital investments we're making right now are very diversified, and they're for varying reasons. You go to Asia, Ray just said we're importing cans right now into China, so we need that capacity. You go to Brazil, but I said the capacity last year as an industry, we believe we're short 1.5 billion to 2 billion cans and it's growing 15% to 20% year-over-year. Over in Europe, as Ray said, that we are short in cans and we need cans out of Serbia. And then here in North America, it was more of a cost-play, that we actually closed, took out a bunch of fixed cost and to took some of those -- some of that equipment, move it up in the Whitby, Ontario and saved a bunch of freight, and we were able to install a new line, 16 and 24-ounce line. And remember, Torrance made 16-ounce, so we needed some 16-ounce capability in a segment of the North American that's growing 30%. So all of those are very different. And you are -- it's fair to take a look from a top-level-down looking at it, but when you look at it bottoms up, we feel pretty confident in what we're talking about. And as we have been saying for a number of months, we're very much focused on the execution. We're not going to get over SKUs but we think these are good return opportunities for us.
Daniel Khoshaba - KSA: So then the answer, I guess, is that the drivers are different than they were, perhaps, 15 years ago?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, and remember, Dan, a lot of it -- us and our competitor, a lot of it -- the spending is in emerging markets.
Daniel Khoshaba - KSA: Yes, for sure. I mean that's a big difference, yes? Ray, good to hear you. And I appreciate it. Good quarter, guys.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.
George Staphos: A couple questions. One, what's the latest on BPA and your coating supplier's ability to provide you an alternative that's BPA free, if required by your customers, without getting into the science and whether there's any real fact to whether it should be in the first place a concern for people. But what's your supplier's ability to help you right now?
John Hayes: Well, we won't get into facts, as no one else seems to be getting into facts about BPA. But the reality is, let's talk about beverage on one hand and food on the other. On the beverage can side, we are testing various coatings, internal coatings. And we believe that if push comes to shove, we would be in reasonably good position to execute on the BPA front on the beverage side. On the food can side, it varies so much because there's a tremendous amount of different specs relative to if you're talking about tomatoes or if you're talking about green beans or other food stuffs, we have -- we will be having approximately 20% of our cans in BPA-non-intent this year, and we think we can go over 50% next year. And we are struggling with some categories, but those categories we're struggling with are not in important part of our business.
George Staphos: Okay. So you have -- John, if I heard you right, you said you would have the capability of being BPA-free in roughly 20% of your specs in food right now?
John Hayes: Yes, that's what we're currently targeting. And discussions continue with the coatings supplier, so.
George Staphos: Understood. One thing that I was thinking about, both off of this call and some of the others that have occurred this morning, obviously there's a lot of discussion about food inflation and whether that's having an effect on demand or not. And I was wondering, do you think, realizing that you're, probably unintentionally, but nonetheless biased, do you think that an environment where you start to see food inflation once again impacting grocery demand, that the food can would hold up relatively better or relatively worse relative to other products that are packaged in other packaging materials, do you think?
John Hayes: Well, we've always tried to, at least internally, look at economics cycles, inflation cycles, relative to our -- the products that we serve. And there is a strong case to be made that we ought to be better off relative to other packaging types in times where the consumer has less money in their pocket. And whether that's an economic cycle or an inflationary cycle, we haven't been able to draw a direct correlation to that, but I think intuition would suggest that. We've seen a bit of softness this quarter, but as Ray said, it's the first quarter the seasonal pack is really coming up. It largely has to do with, what we believe, our inventories are being held by our customers. And so I think as time goes on, George, we'll be able to see better visibility if that piece holds true.
George Staphos: Last question. Over the last 20 years, you've seen this conversion that's occurred gradually over time in food cans from 3 to 2 pieces. You had, Milwaukee and Columbus, your competitor in Owatonna, you'll see conversions. Would a 2-piece can provide a cost benefit to your customer? And what I'm thinking about is how do you preserve the can's place in the grocery aisle and the center of the store when you've had so much in the way of template increases? Or are the capital issues associated with two piece and the lack of flexibility still sort of impediments and so, your share has settled out where it like from an industry standpoint now, where it likely will settle out in terms of 2 versus 3-piece? And part of the question behind the question is, if there was opportunity to move more towards a 2-piece, then that would be another way that you could, over time, balance the 12-ounce market in beverage in the US. What are your thoughts there?
Raymond Seabrook: Possibly, George -- this is Ray. The trouble with 2-piece is, you need a lot of volume in the same size. So start changing sizes or diameter or heights on cans, it doesn't bode well for 2-piece. You need to have 500 million, 600 million units in the same sized, otherwise it doesn't work for 2-piece. Yes, the 2-piece is probably a slightly lower-cost technology, but you got to have the volume. So over time, things with higher volumes have migrated to 2-piece, but a lot of which left in 3-piece, it's different sizes, diameters, shapes, and it doesn't have enough volume to justify 2-piece. So a lot of that has happened, I believe, and I think as long as -- let's face it, as long as steel stays competitive to the other product rates, food can is going to be just fine.
John Hayes: And one last thing to just play on that is, there is a very big infrastructure in place in terms of processing food cans. And to recapitalize that for no volume, that's a consideration on our customers' wants.
Operator: The next question is also a follow-up question from Chris Manuel of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Just 2 quick ones. One is, and it kind of centers on the same thing, as you're looking out today at, you've been very active on the acquisition front in the last couple of years, and you've found some really terrific opportunities that you're moving forward with, how do you -- what are you seeing as you look out today? Do you find any opportunities or any specific geographies? How do you think about your product sets again, things of that nature?
John Hayes: Let me first talk generally about capital allocation, because that's what you're getting to, and then maybe I'll try as best I can to talk about specifics. We've created a lot of value at this company over the years by taking the cash flow and pulling it 3 ways: number one, through acquisition; number two, through investments, internally, through internal growth and CapEx projects; and three, through return of capital via share repurchase and dividend. That is not changing. In any given year, there's a relative prioritization that occurs, given the opportunity set that you see out there. We've been able to be patient and tenacious, at the same time, around some of these acquisitions, and we will continue to do so. We, as any company that looks at acquisitions, we at any given time, as the number of pokers in the fire, so to speak, and you never know when those will hit. And today is no different than it is right now. As Scott has said in his comments, that we are investing internally in CapEx, we've talked about that. Unless something else happens on the M&A side, we're going to be delivering the balance of our cash flow to share repurchase and dividends. So I know I'm not specifically talking about the acquisitions that you'd like me to, but I think it would be premature to do that.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: That's fair. And, to be clear, I'm in no way questioning your ability to redeploy capital. You have an outstanding track record over the past few years of doing that, using all three of the levers you suggested. But as a follow up, as we think about the next, let's call it, 12 to 24 months, obviously right now you're in a bigger capital spurt as you're adding some capacity in numerous environments. And you've sort of laid out that $200 million is more of a maintenance level, given some of the commentary in the press release today. How does that move forward the next 24 to 36 months as you think about opportunities that you see today? Do you still continue to see more opportunities to deploy above maintenance-oriented capital levels, or do you think that moves back closer to that $200 million, $250-ish million level over the next few years?
John Hayes: Well, I think what we said is this is probably higher than what we'd expect as we go forward. Scott did mention that, certainly, in the January call. Again, it is opportunity-specific from the bottoms, up. We would expect our capital to be coming down, but at the same time, when we're -- if the markets continue to grow like they are, we want to be responsive to that. And a good example of that is the Aerocan business we recently acquired. We had thought we'd have to put capital in late this year or early next year to fund some of this growth, and it happened more quickly. So we're accelerating that a bit. It was always in our plans, but the timing of it relative to late this year versus earlier this year, that's a good example of how you can never predict this to an exact science. But we would expect over time, absent good projects out there, for it certainly become a now.
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from Chip Dillon with Crédit Suisse.
Chip Dillon: Sorry to drag the call on, just a real quick one. One of your big competitors has been on quite a tear in terms of building capacity, as you know. And it's very clear, I think, to a number of us, that they are probably going to down throttle quite a bit next year. And it may be early days, but you mentioned, John, opportunities. Do you think, if I -- let's just make the assumption that, that is their strategy -- that there might be increased potential for more plants like you're doing now in China and Brazil as we look at '12 and '13?
John Hayes: Well, it's always difficult to predict. We're very customer focused. We talked about that. And our philosophy around capital is we'll do it on the back of a long-term agreement with our customers. And we've been very successful in doing that. and to the extent our customers see value in continuing to do, we're going to consider it. But I do think it is premature to be talking about that. But we want to keep up, as Ray has said, that we want to keep up with our relative share of the growth, and we fully expect to do that.
Chip Dillon: And would it be fair to say -- I mean, again it's early days, but if you look at Brazil, a lot of what happened there, it seems like there's a bit of catch-up to handle the fact that they're importing cans, whereas my perception is that Asia still has a lot more to go. Is that -- as you look at your 3- to 5-year plan, would you agree with that, that probably relative to each other, that Asia has probably more potential than Latin America?
John Hayes: Well, I think that's generally true. And let me just give you 2 data points that would help support that. Number one, its largest beer market in the world in terms of overall consumption of beer. And number two, as Ray said, it's got a 4% or 5% can share as a percent of the package mix. So you combine those 2, and there's only one way to go for the can, whereas in Brazil, it is a good, strong growth market, but it already has mid-30s penetration.
Operator: And Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions.
John Hayes: Okay, excellent. Well, thank you Edison, and thanks, everyone, for participating our call. I have one announcement that we'd like to make. On October 10 and 11 here in Colorado, we're going to have an investor field trip. And Scott will be reaching out to others, but if you want to mark your calendars on that.  And again, thank you for your participation. We look forward to catching up with everyone on our second quarter call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover, Chairman at Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
R. Hoover: Thanks, Thelma, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2010 results.  The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at www.ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is John Hayes, Ball's President, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott is going to discuss the financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John is going to follow with details about our operating performance and the outlook for 2011.  Ball reported strong fourth quarter results due largely to strong operating performance across all our various packaging businesses, excellent program performance in Aerospace, emerging market growth and benefits from our strategic actions taken over the past year or so.  In addition to improved results, recent key actions included the successful completion of a new $1.4 billion credit facility, a $500 million bond offering, installing a second line in our Belgrade plant and the announcement just last week that we have successfully closed on the Aerocan acquisition in Europe. Also in the quarter, Ball Aerospace won additional business, increasing our year end backlog to $989 million.  So 2010 was an excellent year for Ball. In recognition of the company's strong performance and the growth opportunities ahead, the Board of Directors yesterday approved a 2-for-1 stock split, an increase in the dividend by 40% and a new share repurchase authorization of $20 million post-split shares.  And as I mentioned earlier, John Hayes is here in the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Ball, something we announced back in November would occur, and it did yesterday. So congratulations to John. I will remain Chairman of the Board.  I would digress for a second, and our very capable Director of Investor Relations, Ann Scott, did a quick count. And as near as we can tell, this call is something like my 70th, that would be 7-0, or maybe 71st earnings call with the investment community. And that's probably enough. So I'm not going to do this anymore after today. But I do want to thank all of you in the investment community, sell side, buy side and, certainly, our investors.  Many of you have actually heard probably most all of those 70 calls, and it's been a great relationship that we've had over these many years. I have a high degree of confidence in this new CEO sitting to my left. And of course, Scott is a recent winner of the best CFO that you all put him up for, which I thought was deserved recognition. I think that our more than 14,500 employees around the world right now really are what makes our company better. We've got an excellent management team that is ready to continue the fine performance. We spent the last couple of days with our Board reviewing our short and longer range business plans. And after more than 40 years here, I've never seen the company in better shape than it is right now. So it's with a lot of pride and anticipation in what I expect to be a great future that I join you today. This is a pretty good call to be hosting.  So with that, Scott, I would turn it over to you to talk about the quarter.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $1.06 versus last year's $0.83. The following factors contributed to improved results: A tax benefit of $11.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share related to the refinancing in December of the company's term loan and revolving bank facilities; growth on our majority-owned Brazilian JV with fourth quarter being the strongest in Brazil; volume improvements and excellent operating performance in our Metal Packaging businesses; exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business and a lower share count.  These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $7 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs and higher interest expense. A lower euro in the quarter compared to last year decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter and $0.14 for the year compared to 2009. Turning to full year free cash flow. Ball generated $506 million when adjusting for the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet, which was on target with our expectations and included an incremental $37 million after-tax pension contribution at year end.  In 2010, we returned every free cash flow dollar to shareholders via net share buyback of $507 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of 2010 was approximately $2.66 billion, despite our acquisitions made during the year and acquiring over $500 million of our stock.  Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid, with the 2010 adjusted EBIT to interest coverage at 5x and net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.6x. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Turning to some key financial metrics for 2011. Due to the acquisition financing and a full year of interest expense from consolidating Brazil's debt, we anticipate full year 2011 interest expense to be approximately $180 million. The full year effective tax rate should be in the range of 31%.  On the CapEx front, the full year impact of the JFP, Neuman and Aerocan acquisitions, consolidation of Brazil, specialty can investments and other geographic opportunities we're evaluating, full year 2011 CapEx could approach $500 million. Each of these projects exceeds our after-tax investment hurdle within three years. The timing of certain projects will impact actual spending. And as always, we will keep you updated as the year progresses.  We expect 2011 free cash flow to be at least $400 million, with the majority of free cash flow going to share repurchases. As of today's call, $105 million of our stock has been acquired since the beginning of the year. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion, up slightly due to the Aerocan acquisition and cash being oriented to share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown.  Since there was a business divestiture and JV consolidation as well as major acquisitions that occurred in 2010, and so that everyone gets started on the same page for 2011, I wanted to give you a few key modeling data points. G&A will be slightly above $300 million for the full year. Working capital should be a modest source of cash. Pension expense will be relatively flat.  Cash pension contributions worldwide will be approximately $55 million, lower than normal due to the incremental $37 million after-tax contribution made at the end of 2010.  Maintenance CapEx now runs approximately $175 million. And the December 31, 2010 basic share count was 86,079,000 shares pre-split. So take that into account when calculating yesterday's dividend increase and adjusting for how shares have been purchased year-to-date.  With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations.
John Hayes: Thank you, Scott. As we have said previously, Ball is in a good place and we have momentum as we head into 2011. We are executing on our strategy to grow our worldwide Beverage Can business and Aerospace business, further develop our Metal Food and Household Products Packaging business and utilize our free cash flow and earnings growth to deliver value to our shareholders.  Now turning to the operating segments. Metal Beverage Americas and Asia had significantly higher earnings in the quarter and the year. A full year's impact from consolidating our majority-owned Brazilian joint venture, double-digit volume growth in China, Brazil in specialty cans, an excellent operating performance contributed to our earnings momentum in the quarter.  Also a full year's contribution from the October 1, 2009, four-plant acquisition added to year-over-year annual improvement for the segment. We have spent the past couple of years rebalancing our customer portfolio in North America. Recall that earlier in 2010, we stated that our volumes would take a step back in the year, but would recover in 2011 back to our 2008-2009 levels. We are on track and on plan for this to occur. In 2011, the Americas and Asia segment will be managing several capital projects to meet growing customer demand in Brazil and China, as well as repositioning our North American plant footprint to balance our 12-ounce capacity and respond to growing specialty can demand for beer and non-CSD packages. Execution is critical, and we are very focused on making these projects successful.  Metal Beverage Europe's earnings were down for the quarter and the full year due entirely to the impact of the lower euro. Mid-single-digit volume growth in the quarter was offset by certain costs associated with moving the Lublin line down to our Serbian plant.  The consumption of cans in Germany was up 50% in 2010, a doubling of in-country use to nearly one billion cans, and we see this favorable trend continuing in 2011. We are well-positioned from a manufacturing footprint perspective to take advantage of this expected growth.  Now going forward, the results from the recently acquired Aerocan business will be rolled into the segment and will be supported out of our European headquarters in Germany. We are excited about the prospects for this well-run business, and it will allow us to broaden our customer and product portfolio in a growing segment of the metal packaging industry.  We will be investing some additional capital to take advantage of this growth and ensure that we can respond to customer and market demands for extruded aluminum containers. The management people of Aerocan fit well with our culture and values, and we welcome the Aerocan employees to the Ball team.  Metal Food and Household Products earnings in the quarter were up due to better-than-anticipated volumes, positive impact from the aluminum slug business we acquired in mid-2010 and outstanding plant performance.  While full year segment earnings were flat, it is actually an excellent outcome given the difficult comps due to the inventory holding gains recorded in 2009. The dedication of all plant staff to controlling costs, relentless attention to detail and efficiencies, really made a difference in 2010. Aerospace and Technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margins in the quarter and full year. The award of significant work during the third quarter and excellent program performance were the primary reasons earnings increased.  As Dave mentioned, backlog end of the year at $989 million which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. Multi-year programs will begin ramping up during 2011, allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. As the top line will grow in 2011, EBIT will likely be flat relative to 2010. In summary, our various businesses finished the year very strong in 2010 and we expect to do even better in 2011. Our key focus areas in the coming year will be on integrating of the Aerocan acquisition, executing on capital spending projects, staying close to our customers and monitoring global opportunities to further strengthen our customer and product portfolio in both Metal Packaging and Aerospace.  We fully expect to generate 2011 results in excess of those in 2010. And the company's sound balance sheet allows us flexibility to build on our performance and provides us competitive advantage for years to come. Finally, as this is Dave Hoover's last earning conference call, I would be remiss if we didn't properly and publicly thank Dave for his service to Ball Corporation. David's dedicated over 40 years to ensuring that the company remain humble, honest, energetic and opportunistic. Many words come to mind, but first-class business and a first-class way stand out among them in describing what Dave has brought to Ball. We as employee-owners are better off because of his leadership and his dedication, and we will forever be indebted to him.  The financial performance and stock price developments speaks for themselves. And while it is indeed a team effort here at Ball, Dave was the guiding force for the past decade. The last decade has created a high bar for us. And as we move forward, that I can assure that speaking on behalf of all Ball employees, we are laser focused on having that happen. So Dave, thank you. And with that, Thelma, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: I guess the first question I have is on the outlook within Europe and the trends that you're seeing there, do you think that you have enough volume and/or pricing momentum, if you will, to offset what could be a fairly significant currency headwind?
John Hayes: Yes, we expect, George, some decent growth in Europe. I had mentioned what's happening in Germany. That's going very strong. Western Europe, generally speaking, has been strong. We're seeing a little bit of comeback in the East. And in the South, it's a bit soft. But as we sit here going into 2011, we feel pretty good about the volume outlook. There's been a lot of inflation as well on the raw materials side of the business. But we think we've been able to adequately manage that as well, so we feel pretty constructive as we sit here right now.
George Staphos: As you think about some of the potential new geographic opportunities that you suggested in your commentary, John, could you give us -- to the extent it's not proprietary, maybe it is, but could you give us a bit more color in terms of what you're thinking about either regionally or forefront?
John Hayes: Well, I think what we're talking, George, is more regional. And in many of the places in which we operate that are in emerging or developing markets, we continue to see strong growth. So it's probably a touch premature to be specific about that. But you know where we operate, and we want to take our relative share of that growth as it continues.
George Staphos: Could you give us a bit more color in terms of the decision around Torrance, which I guess is an old Reynolds facility. Why don't you need that capacity from a 12-ounce standpoint? Why do you need it from a specialty standpoint? I mean, what kind of growth are you seeing in that category right now, or what types of specialty cans as well are you seeing most of the growth in?
John Hayes: Yes, George, this is part of our overall rebalancing of our portfolio. And as we look as to where our volumes are moving forward, we just think it was an opportunity to rebalance it and put a little bit more in our Whitby, Ontario facility from a 12-ounce perspective. The Torrance plant, the people are an excellent group there, but it's just a very high-cost place to do business in Southern California there. So that's the rationale around Torrance. In terms of the growth of our specialty, we're seeing it in some of the larger sizes, the 24-ounce, the 16-ounce. Torrance did make some of those larger sizes, the 16-ounce. And so we had the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak. And we're putting some new capacity in Fort Worth, Texas, that should help us out overall.
George Staphos: Trim cans, are you seeing much growth there? Or did that come and go, so to speak, in 2010?
John Hayes: No, it's -- we're still seeing some modest growth. During the 2008, 2009, we did have some softness there, but it's been becoming back, but it's not growing as fast as the 24-ounce or 16-ounce.
Operator: We're going to continue on with our next question. This comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: First question, you made some decent size acquisitions to support your growth strategy in the bottle can market. Is it time to sort of formalize the growth opportunity for this business longer term for Ball? And if you could answer whether some of this growth is going to cannibalize your existing portfolio or is it incremental to what you already have?
John Hayes: Well, overall, the aerosol market has been growing. And in particular, on the aluminum side, a lot of it has to do with changing consumer preferences, we're seeing more deodorants in aluminum impact extruded bottles, and in other things like the hairsprays, et cetera. And so we see some growth not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. And we've been very much focused over the last 18 months to try and develop a strategy on that. I think the Neuman Aluminum was an importantly step in it, and then the Aerocan acquisition was yet something else. So you should expect as we go forward that we're continuing to look. We're only going to do if it's profitable growth for us. You also asked about the conversions. We are seeing a little bit of conversions from steel to aluminum. But fundamentally, there are different markets that they attack. On the tinplate side, it really is more of a household product and paint and general line type of business. And on the aluminum impact extruded, it's more about the personal care and beauty.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And then your commentary on free cash flow being allocated towards share buybacks, is that a signal that M&A may not be the highest priority in '11? Or am I reading too much into it?
Scott Morrison: No, I don't think you should read that into it. We're just gonna use right now, we look to use most of our free cash flow to buy back our stock. And if other opportunities come up, we may adjust that. But right now, that's the plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: I wanted to expand a little bit on the Aerocan side piece, if I could. And maybe come at it from the direction of CapEx potentially being as much as $500 million is a very, very big step up. As you look at the incremental CapEx that you're spending, could you maybe give us a sense as, whether it be product areas or regions or things of that nature, that most of that's going towards?
Scott Morrison: Well, we're seeing great opportunities. I mean, Aerocan, there will be some CapEx associated with that. But much of the CapEx are just going to growth opportunities, whether it's specialty cans here or beverage cans and aluminum aerosol and other places. So we don't see this as necessarily a change. It's just chasing the best opportunities that show good returns.
John Hayes: And let's also not forget that sitting here a year ago, we had not consolidated our Brazil operations. We did not have Neuman Aluminum nor did we have Aerocan. And so just the consolidation of just even maintenance capital for each of those increases our overall CapEx. And then we have announced whether it's the Alumi-Tek bottle here in North America, our Torrance restructuring and the addition of 16-ounce and 24-ounce. We've talked about the Lublin line being moved to Serbia, and then we have some other things on the plate. So we think our 2011 cash flow adjusted for this growth capital is actually going to be better than it was in 2010. And so when it's better than 2010, and we have some opportunities to invest in our business prudently where the returns absolutely are there. And then use every incremental dollar to buy back our stock, we think that's a prudent thing to do for our shareholders.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: When you're looking at -- is there any contemplation within that number of expanding some of the Aerocan assets either towards North America, where you already have some of the slug market, or potentially even South America where you've got some of the steel aerosol today?
Scott Morrison: No, not right now. That's not in our plans.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: If you could maybe just give us a best guess effort as you look out -- you've already given some commentary towards Europe, I think with volumes continuing to be good. But what your outlook might be for North America, South America, Asia, et cetera, for potential for volume for 2011?
John Hayes: Well, as you all know, let's talk about Asia and let's talk about Brazil where volumes have been on a tear, and both those regions, they've been approaching 20% growth year-over-year. And we see -- we don't think that's going to continue to happen over the long term. But as we sit here today, we see those trends still occurring. And Brazil, as you know, they have the World Cup coming up, they have the Olympics coming up, they have a lot of infrastructures projects coming up to help support that. That's going to create more middle-class growth and middle-class rise of incomes, which is certainly helpful to our product. And then in Asia, you have different effects going on with those trends that we've talked about in the past, continuing to go strong. Here in North America, as you all know, the year ended up actually on a strong note. The fourth quarter was up slightly, and we don't see any big deviations from an industry perspective of the change of that. There's certainly some growth in specialty. There's some growth in craft beer. The soft drink has had a lot of promotion going on and off, and we continue to see some spot promotions here and there. So we expect that to occur in 2011. So overall, from an industry perspective, we're assuming relatively flat growth in North America.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Crédit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: Question on the CapEx number for this year and two things. One, can you give us a little bit more detail as sort of how proportionately that roughly 325 that's above maintenance will be spent among the various regions and projects and their startup dates? And then quickly, how do you think CapEx will go next year? Do you think it will probably die down a little bit and assuming no acquisitions? Or it could stay at this level?
Scott Morrison: Sure. Well, the big projects this year that are driving it are North America, we mentioned the Whitby line, the growth in Fort Worth with the 16-ounce to 24-ounce and the Alumi-Tek line. And when you look to other markets, the line that's moving from Lublin down to Belgrade, that's a big chunk of Europe's CapEx for this year. And then we're evaluating other opportunities in other geographies that we just haven't talked about yet. This year is really kind of a big chunk. And then we see CapEx longer term in '12 and '13 going back down to more normalized levels to depreciation or below.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: And is it fair to say of the $500 million that you've identified for this year, maybe $100 million of it could go in that bucket that you just haven't identified yet?
Scott Morrison: That's correct. That's why we haven't given specifics. But it's things that we're continuing to evaluate and just not ready to talk about yet.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: And then looking at the Aerocan opportunity, I mean, from what I understand from that business, it actually floundered a bit. And now it's really hit its time, I guess, over there. And I guess, one, how did you sort of find it? And do you think there are other sort of Aerocans out there, sort of emerging aluminum-based or other metal-based container businesses that might be available that could be like that out there?
John Hayes: This is John. We've been exploring that market, as I've mentioned, actually for a number of years now. And as it started to mature and really accelerate some of the growth that we saw happening, it was just a good opportunity. You're absolutely right, the Aerocan business five years ago was part of a larger conglomerate and was taken private by the management who's done an absolutely wonderful job of repositioning that business, getting its costs in order, getting its revenue in order and help stimulating demand. And so we think it's one of the best run business in that part of the Metal Packaging segment, and we're delighted to have them aboard. And it's going to give us more opportunities to continue to look. There are other companies out there. We also have opportunities to go greenfield. We're still exploring a bunch of different things. And when it's the right time to talk about something that makes good value for our shareholders, we'll certainly do that.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: I wondered if it's possible, just one more time on Aerocan, is it possible to give a sense of what you think the potential market is? Or what you think the potential growth rate in that market might be?
John Hayes: Well, it varies by region. But just to give you a sense, we would say here in North America, it's growing mid-single digits. Down in South America, it's growing faster than that, even approaching double digits. And then in Europe, it's high-single digits. So it certainly has a growth profile that's a little bit better than some of the businesses we're currently in, but it's certainly not as big, either. So as I said we have opportunities to look in all those different places, and the European one made a lot of sense for us at this time.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: I wondered, just as a follow on, can you talk a little bit about Aerospace? It just seems like this business is stepping up to a whole new level of activity. And so I wondered if you could talk about that, and whether you could also talk about what the sensitivity do that business might be to these budget cuts that we're hearing about in Defense and elsewhere across the government?
John Hayes: You're absolutely right. We are stepping up into some things that we're very excited about. We've been working on some of these programs for a very long time. They've been delayed because of all sorts of government budget issues. And as we sit here today, we feel pretty constructive about them. But there is of those big four projects that we won back in the third quarter, a couple of them haven't been funded yet. And we fully expect them to be funded. But as you probably know, our government's operating under a continuing resolution. And so it just takes more time to get those funded, but we're ramping up. We do have some of the money funded towards those things, and we're going full steam ahead. And as we said, those projects are big and they're in the hardware side. And that's typically a lumpy part of our business as we've talked about previously. But it fits directly into the sweet spot of what we do, and these are long-term projects that we're very excited about.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: So, John, as that business flexes to expand with the kind of growth in backlogs that we've seen, is that a lot of extra capital dollars there or not? Is that mostly kind of people?
John Hayes: Yes, mostly people.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just to maybe follow up on the North American restructuring, can you talk about how you see the cost savings? And what the magnitude of those cost savings could be? And how they might flow through either in 2011 and '12?
Scott Morrison: There won't be that much that we get a benefit from in 2011. The plant won't close until sometime mid-year or so. So more of the benefit will come later, in the back half of the year, and then in 2012.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And in terms of magnitude of the savings, have you identified that? Or can you share that with us?
John Hayes: I think we haven't identified anything yet. But we said it in the past, when we close a facility of that size, we typically get in the range of $25 million of savings.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just lastly, as you look at that North American footprint and given the outlook for kind of flattish growth in North America, with this move, do you see any additional restructuring that might need to take place over the next year or two? Or do you feel like the footprint's appropriately sized?
John Hayes: I think the footprint's appropriately sized. As you know, over the past couple of years, we have closed several facilities. I think this is our fourth one in the last three years in this part of the business. So we think our costs are in good line. Our footprints are in good shape. So we don't see anything as we sit here today going forward.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Andy Feinman from Iridian Asset Management.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Scott, I think you said that each one of the capital projects will exceed the required return within three years. What's the required return that you're talking about? Weighted average cost of capital or is it -- you know what I mean? Because these days, if the required return is what you're earning on your cash, then you know what I mean, it's not...
Scott Morrison: It's a bit higher than. Our target of return is different by geography. So in North America, we use a 9% after-tax return. And in other geographies that have a little bit more volatility, it gets them kind of the 11%, 12% type of return required.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Also, Scott, you gave the number of shares at 86.79 million at the end of year. Is that primary or diluted?
Scott Morrison: That's diluted. I'm sorry, it's basic.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: That's what I meant, basic or diluted. And then you said the pension expense would be flat in 2011. Can you tell me what it was 2010?
Scott Morrison: It was around $80 million in 2010.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: And then you wouldn't by any chance have the -- I know you added $37 million to the pension funding in the fourth quarter, but do you have a full year number?
Scott Morrison: Full year pension funding was around $140 million worldwide. So if you look at all of our plants in Europe and the U.S., it's about $140 million.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: So that's $140 million going to $55 million, because you put money in at that time. And then I was just wondering how many shares of DigitalGlobe you still have, and what's the stock price? I was trying to find it on Bloomberg, and I couldn't.
John Hayes: Andy, this is John. I don't have it off the top of my head, but it's a de minimis amount. We don't have that much left.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: So that's not a significant amount of cash that you could realize at some future date?
John Hayes: Don't think so.
Operator: Continuing on, our question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I guess first question on the -- switching, I guess, to Metal Food and Household, with tinplate inflation, can you give us a sense where that's finally shaken out at? You feel you've got that priced in for this year? And did you see any pre-buy in the fourth quarter ahead of this?
John Hayes: Well, as you know, we're seeing signs of inflation in the economy, whether it's oil, food, staples, metal. The input costs for our steel suppliers have gone up and as a result, they've been negotiating higher prices. Obviously, we don't go into the detail of that or the context of our conversations, but we've been working hard on behalf of our customers. And we fully expect to pass all that through to our customers, the increases that we've been receiving. In terms of your question about fourth quarter buy ahead, every year it seems like there's a little bit here and there, but there is nothing of note this year.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I may have missed it. But did you give out what the volume was in that segment in the fourth quarter?
John Hayes: No, I don't think I did. It was roughly flat year-on-year, as the overall market was roughly flat and we were roughly flat as well.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And then as we look out at aerosol cans, what's the outlook for 2011? Do we see a continued rebound there in terms of volumes with increased consumer spending? How did some of the new contracts come along there in terms of volumes?
John Hayes: We're expecting and we're planning for relatively flat volume in that business as well. There's always a little puts-and-takes here. On the paint and general line side, we saw some good rebound back in 2010 relative to 2009. I don't think we're going to expect that to happen again because it has come back but overall, relatively flat.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And in your comments, I know North America bev, you're looking for flat for the market. And then you guys have a step up in terms of volumes. Can you give out what your volume outlook might be looking like for North America bev?
John Hayes: Well, what we said if you go back probably nine months ago or so when we were talking about this, we said we'd be stepping back a couple of billion units of volume in 2010 and then gaining that back and a bit more going back to 2008, 2009 levels. And that's where we are. Recall that in 2008, 2009, we had declined then as well, going into 2010, we took a further step back in 2010. And now we're just getting it back.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: So you see it close to 2008 levels, if I heard you right?
John Hayes: 2008, 2009 levels, yes.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And then last question, I guess for Scott, on the corporate cost line item, what number should we be using as a sustainable number for that?
Scott Morrison: Well, this year, what drove it up a bit higher was the run-up in the stock price. We had a 32% increase in our stock price, so that affects mark-to-market on our deferred compensation plans that runs through that line. And so on a more normalized level, it should drop back down to levels that are probably more in the 60s, low 60s.
John Hayes: And hopefully not drop down too much.
Scott Morrison: Right. We're being conservative on the stock price. But hopefully, we're wrong and it goes up again like that.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Okay, so low 60s for the year?
Scott Morrison: For the year.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Pete Rushmeier from Barclays Capital.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: I was hoping maybe, Scott, you could update us on the underfunded pension balance at the end of the year?
Scott Morrison: If you take out the German plant, which is a pay-as-you-go type of plant, in the U.S. and really all the U.K. plants are little above 80% funded. So the total of the underfunding in the U.S. is around a couple of hundred million dollars.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: I'm curious if we exclude out the pending growth initiatives that you have, how much slack do you have in your system to respond to market demand? How much can you flex in and crank up your volumes, net of your investments and your new projects?
John Hayes: Well, obviously, it varies by business or by geography. Historically, we've been very good at rising to the challenge when we need to do that. In Europe, one of the reasons why we are moving the line from Lublin into Serbia because this is a very good footprint, anticipating the comeback of the can into Germany continues, which we fully expect it will. Here in North America, we think our footprint is right and we don't anticipate any big spikes in that. And if we do have big spikes, we're going to have to scramble a bit. But we think we'd be able to deal with that. And then in Brazil and China, just keeping up with this 20% plus or minus growth we've been experiencing, and it's a wonderful high-class problem to have. And some of the thing Scott was talking about in terms of capital, while we haven't talked about them are targeted in those general areas.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And John, you got a diversified footprint as it is. Do you see enough growth opportunities in these markets? Or do you think that over time kind of strategically, we would see Ball branch out even further from a geographic footprint standpoint?
John Hayes: Well, we're always looking. But when you think about the success we've had over the last decade, a lot of it has to do with capital allocation. And so we're very agnostic when we look at these types of things. And if there's a great opportunity that we can generate sustainable long-term returns, in excess not only of our cost of capital but what we think is a fair value for our stock is, we'll certainly consider those. We've been, as Scott has mentioned, we used all of our free cash flow last year to buy back our stock, but we did have some growth capital. And that's the same methodology we're going through this year. We see some good growth in certain areas. We're not going crazy on that. And we're using all of the incremental, or most of the incremental free cash flow to buy back our stock. And if an acquisition pops up that we think is very attractive, we'll go after that as well. That's how we've created value over the last decade. And that's exactly the same methodology we are using as we look forward.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: You highlighted some of the capacity projects this year. I'm curious if you can elaborate further on the timing of those? And also I'm just trying to understand as you startup these projects, I would imagine that you have a certain amount of startup expense. I mean is there an aggregate amount of startup expense that you're going to incur in '11? And how quickly do you get to the full contribution margin of those projects?
John Hayes: Well, some of the projects we have not -- the timing is unclear because we haven't announced them because we're still evaluating them. Scott was just giving a heads-up that we expect them to occur, but they may not. So the timing on the things we haven't announced is a bit unclear. Some of the other known projects, yes, we do have some startup expense. I don't think we've quantified it on a quarter or even for the year right now. It's a little bit, but I wouldn't worry too much about that. And we think most of the capital that we've talked about, whether it's the Serbia line, whether it's the Alumi-Tek, whether it's the Torrance closure and the Whitby and Fort Worth capital, all those things will be largely completed in 2011.
Operator: Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: On the beer side of things, here domestically, it looks like we're finally seeing beer volumes come back and we are finally seeing there was some increase to vendor support. And I just want to get an idea off of pretty easy comps, if there might be some opportunity for growth in the course of 2011, if you do see that vendor support continue for the beer players?
John Hayes: The beer market in North America, I presume you're talking about that segment, has been soft over the last couple of years. I think the breweries, generally speaking, have been going after value as opposed to volume and as a result, the overall market there has been down a couple of percent every year. There has been some positive signs relative to promotional activity and other things around that. But one of the big impediments is a lot of the unemployment here in the United States is in that 21- to 29-year-old category, and that's a big Beer segment. And I think until we see some improvement on the unemployment in that segment, we're going to still see some muted growth on the Beer segment.
Operator: Gentlemen, we now have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: Dave or John, looking back over time, the mid-2000s, the company ramped its capital spending program. And during that period, there were a couple of hiccups that occurred at that point in time, project net took a little bit of time to get off the ground. Everything obviously worked out for the best, looking back in time. Here the company is once again ratcheting up the level of spending, I realize you don't expect to stay at this level for more than a couple of years perhaps, but how do you guard against perhaps taking on too much when looking back, if you agree with the analogy, looking back in the mid-2000s and some of the hiccups that occurred then?
R. Hoover: Yes, I'm going to start -- I wasn't going to answer any questions but you're talking about things that were really my responsibility, so I want to take the blame for those delays in capital. I think, I'll answer this quickly, George, but these projects are across our business and the business is bigger. Brazil is now a part of all our numbers. It's a large fast-growing market, and some of this capital is going to happen there. In China, we bought JFP, big plant. Some of the capital we're talking about is there. And it's largely things that we know how to do. So we don't see a lot of risk. But you did hear John say our focus this year is going to be an execution.
John Hayes: Yes, absolutely. We're laser focused. We spend a lot of time talking about that making sure we have the right resources, apply it in the right way to ensure the success of these projects. And as Dave just pointed out, there's a diversity of these projects. This is not new technology. This is what we do. And as a result, we are confident that we're going to be able to execute successfully on those.
George Staphos: On the execution front, you have the volume coming back in North America from the rebalancing work you did over the last couple of years. Realizing it's January 27, how is that business being integrated thus far? Any issues that you see? My guess is probably not, given your outlook, but I wanted to get that confirmation.
John Hayes: It's going seamlessly.
George Staphos: I guess that's about as good as it can go. I guess the last question I had for you, John, what message have you been emphasizing with the team and with employees as you assumed the CEO role? And how do you think, if at all, the message or the strategy might change relative to Dave's tenure?
John Hayes: Well, we're not even talking 24 hours here. So but as I said earlier, Ball has been successful because we have been very prudent users of our capital. We've been strategically opportunistic, and we have a very good set of people that have their DNA wired for good set of values and it's all about continuous improvement. And when you do that and combine it with our close-to-the-customer strategy and focus on our customer, that model works. As what I've been talking to people when they ask this question, I say, don't fix what isn't broke. We are in a wonderful place right now. And it's up to the 14,000-plus people at Ball, led by Scott, myself and Ray and others, to make sure that we're focusing as much on replicating what we've done over the past 10 years into the next 10 years.
Operator: And gentlemen, our next question is once again a follow-up from Andy Feinman from Iridian Asset Management.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: I wanted to also ask, your margin in Metal, Food and Household was supposed to be down this year, I thought, because you had the metal gain last year and, instead, it was the same. So I'm not quite sure how you did that and what that means for the future? It was 9.4%, and I never expected it to be that high, so...
John Hayes: Andy, it's a great tip of the cap to the folks that are working in that business. A lot of the improvement came on the cost side of the business. As you know, several years ago, we were struggling in that business and we're not anymore. As we go forward, I think a lot of the low hanging fruit is past us. And so I would not expect an ability to improve margins at all in that business, but we have been doing to a wonderful job of bringing cost out of that business.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: So you think you had maintained them? Because if you maintained them, I think that would be a home run.
John Hayes: Yes, I think we can maintain them. Obviously, you have to adjust for metal and all those things. But the profitability in that business is where we think we can hold it.
Operator: Gentlemen, that was our final question from our audience. I'll turn it back to Mr. Hoover for his concluding remarks. Thank you.
R. Hoover: Well, Thelma, thank you. I think you're probably the best hostess that we've had on our conference calls. So thank you very much for that.  Well, I think that I just would again thank all of you for your interest in Ball Corporation. We feel very good about the future of this company. As I look out over the next few years, and it looks like we're going to have improvements. And I don't know, John, if you want to get a little more specific about what we may be expecting for next year?
John Hayes: It's January 27 right now, and the weather, we have to see what happens with the weather. But as Dave said, we feel very constructive as we head into not only 2011 but equally importantly, beyond. And so we want to thank you for participating. Thank you again, Dave. And we look forward to talking to everyone at the April conference call. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect. Thank you once again, and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2010 Ball Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 28, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover, CEO. Please go ahead.
R. Hoover: Thanks very much, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding the company's third quarter 2010 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me this morning on the call is John Hayes, our Chief Operating Officer and President; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in a moment, Scott's going to talk about our financial results for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow with details about the operating performance. While Ball reported strong third quarter results due largely to excellent operating performance and the impact of strategic actions taken during the last year or so. In addition, to improve results, key achievements in the third quarter included the sale of the Plastics business, the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum and announcement about the consolidation of our salmon can production, the acquisition of an incremental 10.1% of our Brazilian beverage can joint venture and an announcement that we were expanding on production of our commercially successful Alumi-Tek bottle to meet customer demand. Also and importantly, Ball aerospace won significant new business increasing our backlog to $852 million at the end of the quarter, up from $539 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And after that active quarter, we had significant opportunities in front of us to improve performance and carry momentum into 2011 and beyond. Well I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then as I said, John will provide color on our operations before I address our outlook. Scott?
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.40, well ahead of last year's $1.21. The following factors contributed to improved results: positive impact from the four acquired beverage can plants, volume improvement that our global Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional operating performance in our various businesses. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter in G&A, primarily due to compensation costs. Purchase accounting and other costs associated with Brazil totaled approximately $5 million, and we had higher interest expense also related to Brazil. During the quarter, the company realized an $80 million gain on the consolidation of our Brazilian joint venture, which is recorded in equity earnings. A 10% weaker Euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter and $0.13 year-to-date. For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants and two months of interest expense from debt consolidated from Brazil. We now anticipate full year interest expense to be in the range of $145 million on a comparable basis and the full year effective tax rate on continuing operations should be in the range of 31%. At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion, or roughly $100 million reduction from 2009 taken into account the $250 million outstanding under the company's AR securitization program in 2009. Given the growth opportunities before the company and the consolidation of Brazil, we see full year CapEx approaching $300 million. However, free cash flow is expected to be at least $500 million, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming on the balance sheet. We continue to be focused on returning value to shareholders. Our plan is to repurchase more than a net $400 million of our stock for 2010, and that's on track. With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations.
John Hayes: Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, our businesses performed very well across-the-board with EBIT in every segment up year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Comparable results for the quarter in our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment were up nearly 10% with EBIT of $112.8 million versus $102.9 million in the third quarter last year. This increase was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, strong volume growth in emerging markets and growth of certain specialty can sizes, offset by previously disclosed unfavorable volume comparisons in our legacy 12-ounce business and the impact of purchase accounting and other costs associated with consolidating Brazil into the segment that Scott referenced earlier. In North America, Ball's legacy volumes were down mid-single digits versus a flat overall market. Something we mentioned would happen during 2010 before a step-up in volume in 2011. As we described in the second quarter conference call, the strong promotional activity we saw in the early part of the summer subsided after the Fourth of July holiday, while in the Beer segment, cans continue to take share from other packaging types as consumers focused on value. Ready-to-drink treat teas and energy drinks continue to grow relative to a soft 2009. Given the growth in Specialty Beverage cans, capital will be deployed to meet customers' needs. Our recent announcement to install a second Alumi-Tek bottle can line in North America is an example of the type of projects that will benefit us in 2011 and beyond. We continue to monitor C store trends where certain single-served product categories are growing upwards of 10%. In Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in demand driven by overall growth beer growth and beverage can share gains. We remain optimistic about our growth and future profitability in Brazil. In China, herbal teas and beer demand, as well as packaged share gains by two-piece beverage cans over three-piece cans and glass continue to be the main catalyst behind strong volume improvement. We're expanding output in our recently acquired Foshan plant in order to meet demand for beverage cans in Southern China and have many exciting opportunities in the future. In our European operations, third quarter EBIT was $63.1 million versus $68.8 million in the third quarter last year. Volumes in Europe were up mid-single digits and excellent cost controls and plant efficiencies were offset by lower-than-anticipated export volume and the FX translation headwind that Scott mentioned earlier. On a Euro basis, Europe's earnings were up in the quarter versus last year. The momentum in the German beverage can market recovery continues. Total industry can sales in Germany were up more than 56% in the quarter versus third quarter 2009 and 41% year-to-date versus last year. We remain bullish on recent trends in Germany. And as you know, Ball is well positioned to benefit from the continuing return of the Can in that market. Our Food and Household Products segment had an excellent quarter, given the early end to the seasonal fruit and vegetable harvest in the Midwest. Volumes in this segment were down mid-single digits during the period. Third quarter EBIT of $49.4 million was up significantly versus the $27.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, excellent operating performance. Our plants are doing a tremendous job and better mix contributed to better results. During the quarter, we integrated the Neuman Aluminum acquisition into the segment. The integration went extremely well and the collaboration was excellent. We will leverage this business capabilities as we continue to assess opportunities to broaden our product line within the Food and Household and Beverage segments. Aerospace had a strong quarter with EBIT of $18.4 million versus $16.2 million a year ago on essentially flat revenue. Exceptional program performance and on-orbit completion awards favorably impacted the quarter. While the recent wins in our Aerospace business were contemplated, as you know, we had mentioned that we were ahead a number of irons [ph] in the fire, it is gratifying to see some of them come to fruition, and we still have good opportunities for additional wins in the future. As Dave mentioned, backlog is up significantly, which sets us up nicely going into 2011 and beyond. The recently awarded JPSS and WorldView-3 contracts, as well as others, are multi-year programs that will ramp up during 2011 allowing for more meaningful earnings impact being recorded in 2012. So in summary, our operations are in a strong position as we approach the end of 2010 and continued execution of selected opportunities as we move forward will only add to our strong base. And with that, we'll turn it over to Dave to wrap it up. Dave?
R. Hoover: Thanks, John, and thank you, Scott for your comments as well. The company is performing very well, and we've got some momentum going. We expect this positive momentum to continue as we approach the end of this year and progress into next year and beyond, as I said earlier. We're in an incredibly strong position, both in and operations as John described, but also our balance sheet, strong cash flow are good to see. So for the full year, our goal continues to be to post second half 2010 comparable results higher than those in the first half, which were $2.25 per diluted share. And we're going to do what we can to make that a reality. And with that, Jennifer, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: I guess the first question I had as we look out to 2011 and the anticipated pickup in beverage can volume you see in North America, are there any things that you need to do in advance of that from an operating standpoint or a staffing standpoint? Or do you think that you're pretty well situated to take that volume as it comes on?
John Hayes: George, this is John. We're pretty well much situated as we move into 2011. We did take a step back and we had a bit of open volume in our legacy plants in 2010. And so as we move into 2011, we're are in the process of various qualifications things and so far so good.
George Staphos: Similar question as far as Aerospace goes. It was nice to see backlog pick up as it did. Do you feel that as you went through this downturn, I know there's a balance between maintaining margins and maintaining flexibility when the business finally did come back. Do you have again the staffing and the capabilities ready to go as that business comes back in?
R. Hoover: George, we are focused like the laser on just that, and the short answer is yes. Many of these programs don't ramp up month one. They will start to ramp up over a series of six to 12 months, and so that allows us some flexibility in terms of making sure we have the right people with the right experience and training in the right position, so we feel pretty good where we are right now.
R. Hoover: And you know George as things slow down, we really didn't have to separate that many people. And we've been real careful to maintain careful [ph] capabilities.
George Staphos: Are there any capabilities that you need to recruit for Dave at this juncture? Or again, do you feel you're pretty well situated?
R. Hoover: We're going to have to grow our employment somewhat, but I think we were down like a net 28 people this year. So even during the time where you reduce and some cases we've been hiring in others, as you can see from the results in the quarter, I don't think we've got down as much as I was fearful that we might and so this is really good news. As John says, it's not going to flip like a rubber band, but it really, under periods of the next few years of performance for this business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Looks like steel tinplate prices could be up quite a bit in '11. Are you anticipating any sort of pre-buy in 4Q in any of your Steel-based businesses?
R. Hoover: Nothing of significant that would be out of the ordinary. There's all sorts of discussions about what's going on in the steel markets, and we're in the midst of negotiations right now and I don't think it's wise to comment on these things, but we do live in a volatile world and we're going to do all that we can to negotiate as best we can on behalf of our customers.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And just separately, one of your competitors in particular is having a lot of capacity in Brazil and China. I realize you've added capacity in Brazil as well. But just given your comments and how strong china volumes are, can you share with us your thoughts on how you're manufacturing footprint in China will change over time?
R. Hoover: Well I think we're in a pretty good place. The market continues to grow quite strongly, call it, 20% plus or minus and off of a base that's somewhat healthy. So when you just think about what that means, there's a couple of billion cans per year coming into the market. And so we have as you know, our footprint in China is very well situated in the north, the central and the south and as opportunities continue to come up, we're going to take advantage of them in a prudent way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Just following on that, is there any chance over the next year or so you might be able to provide us with a little more granularity between kind of North America and Brazil and China?
R. Hoover: Granularity in terms of?
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Just sort of size of the business, kind of unit volume in the different markets?
R. Hoover: I guess the short answer is yes. We can certainly talk about that. As we sit here today, as you know, the North American beverage can market is approximately $100 billion. We have approximately $40 billion of those, excluding the joint venture we have. Down in Brazil, it's, call it $13 million growing quite strongly. And we've got approximately -- remember we're adding a second line as we speak. It will probably up and running by the end of this year, and we're looking at other opportunities, but once that line comes in, we'll have well over $3.5 billion of capacity down there. That's all sold out. And then as you go over into China, it's about the similar size and our position in China is a little bit bigger than that. So we think we're in a pretty good position to take advantage of some of this growth in a prudent way as it comes our way. We're very much customer-focused and so we're talking with our customers and they're talking with us actively about it, and to the extent it makes sense for Ball Corporation to be investing in these regions, we're all at it.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: And then John when you look in other markets, like let say, Argentina, are you shipping cans out of Brazil into those markets? Or how do you deal with that?
John Hayes: Not particularly. The Brazil market is so strong right now and the Argentina economy is only fair right now. They have a lot of changes that's going on there and the can market is all not that big there. They do sell cans into it, but our primary focus is into the Brazil market.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Finally, can you guys talk at all about BPA. There was this story out with the Canadian move several weeks ago and just talk to us about what you're doing right now to potentially phase out or move away from BPA in your business?
R. Hoover: Over the last -- I won't get into the politics of BPA. I'll leave that to others, but we recognize that at a minimum from our consumer perspective that people have some questions and over the last 18 months to 2 years, we've been actively working within Ball Corporation as an industry and with the coating suppliers to provide alternatives to our customers, relative to BPA. We've had some success in terms of test packs in a good number of different categories, and we're still working on some others. So we're pushing as hard as we can to make sure that we are providing what our customers need. But these things because of FDA approvals and other matters, they don't happen overnight. And one of the issues that the industry has to be mindful of is as we move into alternative coatings, that they fit within the requirements of FDA. And that is a moving target as well, these days.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: That Canadian decision, did that have any near term impact on the business?
R. Hoover: No it doesn't.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: First question is you mentioned that the volume trends in Europe are up about mid-single digits, but that you had lower exports from Europe. What would that have done to the overall segment volumes? Was it still up even including the export decline?
R. Hoover: Oh, yes, they were. Yes, they were. We export out of -- from Europe, used as a base everywhere from, to Africa, a little bit in the Middle East, as well as into India and places like that. But that's not a huge component of our business, but it certainly put a little bit of damper on it. But just to give you a context, the overall market was, call it up, 4% or so, and we were right in line with that. We might have been a little bit better if the export had been better.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: And then as a follow-up and I think it's been a while since we asked you a question about this, but my goodness, the Aerospace backlog really took off in the quarter. And especially given some of the budget issues, I think that was a surprise, certainly it was to me and good news for you. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and how you think that business is going to progress into next year? Because obviously you do have some lead time in terms of how the earnings flow from that business.
R. Hoover: Well, as we said earlier, as John said, these programs are hardware-oriented primarily and the WorldView-3 win that we had is from the company [indiscernible] that does imaging of the earth. This is the third in a series of satellites that we've built. It will ramp up starting kind of now and through next year, I don't really know when the peak employment will be, but probably not even next year. And so that gives you an idea of how these work. It's going to take a few years to build at least the initial parts of these. The other thing is that some of the programs that we're getting involved with, like the national weather satellites and so forth, there's a continuous kind of need in their long-term operational programs. And some that we can't talk about, but they're just a real good basic business for our company. We had it on our board meeting yesterday, a discussion about this. And we had a number of pretty good growth years, a couple of years ago then we had a bit of a dip through the last year or so. I think and hope that we're back on the kind of trajectory we were. So I don't know that we would project above double digits or single-digit growth over time, but it could happen. I mean the business, a decade ago, was 10% of the company when we were $3 billion, and it's still 10% of the company when we're $8 billion. And so it is at a pretty good growth trajectory during that time. We think it will continue.
John Hayes: One of the things also is the reason why I mentioned in my comments that we're well positioned not only for '11, but more importantly '12 and beyond, is because each of the programs were in a bit of transition. 2010 has been strong because despite relatively flat revenue, we've been performing extremely well on many of these projects and programs that are completing. And so we've been receiving awards because we've been doing quite well on that. And so as we start to ramp up in 2011, some of these new ones, there's a bit of a mix issue. Nothing to worry about, but that really positions us well for 2012.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: John, maybe I could just start on the Americas beverage performance. If I look at it on a year-over-year basis, you're up about $10 million in EBIT, but your revenue is up about $300 million. Could you just help us bridge kind of the difference? I know you mentioned there was some acquisition cost in there, but just maybe help us bridge why it was enough, perhaps more?
Scott Morrison: Yes, this is Scott. From a margin percentage basis, you have to remember that the metal that we told for customers is going to have an impact on margins. So year-over-year, the LME is about up 15%, so just passing that metal through reduces our margin by about 1.5. Up from an EBIT dollar standpoint, it doesn't change, but from a margin percentage it does. And then the consolidation of Brazil -- remember we didn't consolidate Brazil for the full quarter just for part of the quarter. And the purchase accounting cost that we have with that and some other one-time cost kind of dampened the EBIT dollars for the quarter.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And just to make sure I understand that, the purchase accounting is the full effect, but you only got Brazil for part of the quarter?
Scott Morrison: Correct, and that's why you see on the non-controlling line down below, you don't see anything going out in the future. You'll see dollars going out on that line as the purchase accounting FX go away and we start to a more normalized profitability.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then can you just maybe just do the similar type of bridge in the Americas Food and Household segment just in terms of that segment was up pretty significantly from third quarter '09 to third quarter '10 upwards of $21 million? Just help us in terms of bridging what drove that meaningful performance?
John Hayes: I'll tackle that one. Two things really drove it. Number 1, product mix. Aerosol was stronger and some other things in terms of value-added, the Food side. And then the other thing is, as I mentioned in my comments, our plans have been performing tremendously well. And the year-over-year improvement despite a strong 2009, tip of the cap to our folks because they've been doing an absolutely wonderful job in the plants of making sure we're focused on the right things and getting after it as soon as practical.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: One last question for Scott just in terms of what the current share count is?
Scott Morrison: When we filed the Q a couple of days ago, it's 88.4 million shares.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Couple of questions for you. First, we got to come back to our favorite business at the 10% of you guys now in Aerospace. Of all these contracts that you've been winning, have they been fixed contracts or they cost plus?
R. Hoover: It's a combination, but fair amount of fixed price work here. There are things we know how to do and have done, like the WorldView for example, and so that's the answer to that.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: So that probably bodes pretty well then for margins, one would expect?
Scott Morrison: We touched with, we think so.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Second question was for you, Scott. On the corporate expense side, it really ticked up quite a bit in 3Q. Could you maybe give us a little color as to what happened there? And what a reasonable run rate might be?
Scott Morrison: If you compare it to the second quarter, most of that difference would be stock price difference and the effect that, that has on our composition plans. If you look year-over-year, most of that has to do with other compensation. We're performing better, so we get paid a little bit better.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: If I can ask a question about your recent Neuman acquisition. You mentioned that, that's an area you're looking at to target for other investments or other opportunities. As you look out at the landscape there, what types of opportunities do you think -- which markets look most attractive? Obviously you're big in beverage, but the aluminum, the aerosol market seems to be growing pretty rapidly as well. Could you maybe give us a little color there as to what you see is opportunities and geographic commentary as well?
R. Hoover: Yes, I'd be happy to. I don't want to be too specific for obviously competitive reasons, but the reason why we think it's attractive to us because we think there's geographic play. We think we can leverage both our Aerosol and the Beverage side of the business and a lot of the know-how in what we do in terms of forming aluminum, in particular. And those three things have provided us opportunities. As you know, the Neuman acquisition was not a big acquisition, but it allows us to get in to part of the supply chain that we think is important. And we have different options that we are currently considering, with respect to what other things we ought to be doing.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Last question is a follow-up on that one is, from a cost perspective, would it be really capital intensive to build out some of that business?
Scott Morrison: It requires capital, but it's not like the Beverage business, I would say.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just had a quick question, the Europe Bev Can business. Heading into the year, there were some concerns that there might be some slight capacity, but obviously demand's been really strong. So can you give us a feel for operating rates and just pricing as we head into 2011?
Scott Morrison: First in terms of, I'll call it operating rates, remember, it is more seasonal than other parts of the world in terms of that. And to be quite honest, we, for a short period of time this summer, we weren't able to keep up with demands of our customers, so we're actively looking at how to treat with that going into 2011. But I think all of our plants are running very well and the industry was reasonably tight during the summer months. What that means, going forward into pricing, who knows it's still early and we're in discussions with our various customers, we've had some raw material increases. We've had some input increases and so those discussions are, as I said, in the beginning stages of them.
Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Do you have any update for us on the Lublin plant?
Scott Morrison: Nothing other than, as I just mentioned, we're actively looking at making sure that we have the right capacity to fulfill our customer demand, not only in the West, but also in the East.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: One of your glass competitors are, I guess, one of your rich package competitors, I should say. Glass was talking about the Dead Sea beer volumes get a bit better over the last month or two, heading into the fourth quarter. I just want to get an idea if you're seeing any signs of that recovery on bev cans [indiscernible] as well and beer drastically?
R. Hoover: Well, what I would say generally on the beer, I don't think we've seen any meaningful deviations over the last month or two. Many of the beer industry there's a lot of noise about aggressive price taking from the beer companies in a declining beer market. But the reality for us is that consumers don't trade out of beer. They should trade down in beer and that's why the beverage can has actually been performing pretty well during 2010 in the U.S. beer market.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: And then just one quick follow-up on Europe. I guess a bit surprised that the Eastern European business didn't seem to do a bit better with a couple of the major beverage guys talking about nice growth there. Are you seeing any rebound yet in that market? Or is it still pretty stagnant?
R. Hoover: It's modest increases, but nothing like it was before, and it's actually down very slightly relative to the overall market. I think the Western Europe has been growing at a clip higher than the average. In eastern, it's been a little bit lower than the average.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Maybe a question for John. I was curious if you could amplify your comments or maybe it was David's comments on Germany, obviously some big growth rates off of a low base. How much of the potential market of pack types do you think cans can take in Germany? Over what time frame and how you think about positioning for growth there?
R. Hoover: Let's have a little history, go back in history. In 2002 prior to the beverage can being deposit, there was a, call it, with domestic consumption, call it 6 billion to 6.5 billion units. It got to a low of several hundred million cans a few years ago. We believe we have a shot this year of, as an industry, approaching close to a billion cans. I don't know if we'll reach it quite there, but you see the trajectory when you're talking about what 41% increases year-over-year, that's quite strong. What's driving it is the discount retail chains are starting to lift cans, which are good. I think now if not two, there's three that are listing them currently. The big guys have yet to list them so that could be a lot of up that were to happen. But I think the whole tone and tenor of the discussion about the return of the beverage can into Germany is much better and much more constructive today than it has been in the last 8 years.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And how do you position to do, invest or participate in that growth?
R. Hoover: Well we are -- that is what we're actively studying. And that's why when we have something to announce, we will, but we think we're very well positioned relative to our installed capacity to take advantage of that right now. And what we probably have to do is look at our overall footprint and look at the regional supply and demand then make sure we're matching that appropriately.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And shifting to Brazil, certainly very strong market, but we've also seen very significant announcements over the next 12 to 18 months for bev can capacity expansions. I'm curious, how you characterize the risk of potentially getting into an oversupply situation anytime soon in Brazil?
R. Hoover: One of the things we talked very closely is what our customers are doing in terms of investing and the filling operations for cans. And that has been growing very, very strongly and so that gives us comfort that the supply demand should not be too far out of whack at all because they continue -- our customers continue to invest in can filling, the can continues to take share as package mix and the overall beer market, which is really driving this, continues to grow at mid to upper single-digit growth rates. So you put those three things together and I think it bodes well in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I just wanted to get your comments on volumes in Western Europe versus Eastern Europe if you're seeing any signs of recovery in Eastern Europe and what your customers might be thinking about growth there next year?
R. Hoover: Well, as we talked the Western Europe is growing a little bit faster than Eastern Europe currently. What's driving both West and East, the growth there, is actually not beer, it's more soft drink, which has been a reversal. Back through the most of the 2000s, beer was really driving it hard. And not the down, so to speak, but it's a little bit more muted than some of the things we're seeing in the soft drink side. And so as we look into 2011, I think a lot of it has to do with the economic recovery. The Eastern Europe is a bit behind Western Europe in terms of recovery from an economic perspective. And I think that drives some of the use of our product and the use of beer versus soft drink generally. And so we remained constructive about Eastern Europe. Don't get me wrong, but the economic recovery has to accelerate before we see a strong acceleration of beer and CSD consumption.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Did you indicate what your Eastern European volumes did in the quarter?
Scott Morrison: Yes, we talked about that before. I said overall market's about 4%. Western Europe's a little bit higher than that. Eastern Europe's a little bit below that, but they're all in growth mode.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I wanted to, also with steel prices going up, I wanted to get your thoughts on how you view the relative competitive profile of your steel beverage cans in Europe versus aluminum?
R. Hoover: Well we've had a dual metal strategy for a long time in Europe. And as we talked about before, there is a lot of noise out in the marketplace about what's going to happen with steel versus what's going to happen with aluminum. I think it's too early to tell, but our dual metal strategy has played as well. And when one gets out of whack with the other, we take advantage of that with one substrate over the other and vice versa when those things reverse. So it doesn't overly concern us too much at this time.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Is there a point at which steel rises where you'd feel you need to convert some of that capacity to aluminum? Or are we very far from that right now?
R. Hoover: Never say never, but there's always a point where aluminum gets too high. You have to consider moving to steel and vice versa. I don't think we're at that point now, but we're very cognizant of the fact that we have to be competitive in the marketplace and the various substrates we use have to be competitive in the marketplace.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Final question is just CapEx. For next year, if you have any type of preliminary kind of CapEx number for next year?
Scott Morrison: Not a number, but I think directionally, we're seeing a lot of opportunities that we're looking at pursuing, so I could see CapEx drifting up.
R. Hoover: We're consolidating Brazil so by definition, it's going to be higher as well.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: But you still think $500 million of free cash is a sustainable number even with the drift up in CapEx, it sounds like?
R. Hoover: I think it's a little early to pin it down next year, but we expect to continue to have real strong cash flow even with an increase in CapEx? I don't know Scott if...
Scott Morrison: No, that's exactly right. Our cash flow this year will be very strong, and we don't see anything in the future that would dramatically change our free cash flow number. But obviously, we spent a little bit more CapEx. We think we're going to make more money next year too.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Weather [ph] from WHV [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Could you talk a little bit more about in the Aerospace? Is nature the revenues there? Can you talk about the mix between the contracts and projects? And I'm curious, do you expect with the investment going up in '11, that we'll see an operating margin shift downward temporarily?
R. Hoover: In the Aerospace business? I think David mentioned earlier, historically we do the full spectrum, everything from cost plus to firm fix price and sometimes cost plus with the success fee and it goes everything from one end to the other. I think as we look forward to some of the projects that we've won, they are a little bit more biased towards fixed price and they are cost plus. Typically, when we perform well, that bodes well for us. You had mentioned investment. I don't think we anticipate much investment, if you will, in that business. Yes, we're making sure we have the right skill set of people, but as many of our successful programs are rolling off this year and we're building the ones next year, we are going to have higher sales in that business. Most likely, are going to have higher profits in that business, but the margin is probably going to be a little bit more muted just because there's mix of starting programs versus finishing successful programs. But again, nothing to worry about it. And as we go into 2012, as we execute on these programs, we feel very good about where we stand with that business.
Scott Morrison: We've said this before, I don't know how long you followed the company, but we also make antenna and other hardware and that business has been growing nicely and continues to. And we have a tech services part of the business for our software people that work in DoD. And both of those are well above $100 million of sales for each of them, so out of the total. And even through this period where the Hardware business was down a little bit, they've been continuing to grow and certainly contribute to the success. We contract both the civil and DoD and some commercial work, but that's sort of the mix of business. I think we used to talk over time if we're when our game and sort of the cost-type work, we should be able to make 8% or so. In the fixed price, we're going to make a little more than that because it would take a little more risk. And you can look at the numbers and see that, that's kind of the year we're having.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: I wanted to food cans. Questions came up earlier, I guess, from Mark on BPA and of the things I understood about the alternative coatings that you've been working on is that, there was some application obviously in success with certain products, but there were other, perhaps more aggressive products, where the alternative coatings your suppliers were working on hadn't quite been able to deal with them. Is that still the case, if I'm remembering it correctly?
Scott Morrison: Yes, generally speaking that is the case. I'll also remind you though of some of those more aggressive products, certainly the one's high in asset and other things. It's not a big proportion of the food can market.
George Staphos: I guess to the extent that your customers are willing to experiment with these coatings, is there a view that the ultimate consumer is willing perhaps to contend with less good performance from these coatings and perhaps, after taste and that sort of thing? Or they haven't even gotten that road yet?
R. Hoover: I think it's pretty mature to talk about that. There's trade-offs with everything and with some of these new coatings, the shelf life might be a bit shorter, but so our conversations with our customers they're certainly aware of that. And they are factoring into that, into their plans as they go forward.
George Staphos: John, two last questions on Food. On the one hand, the margin that you're putting up are terrific by historical standards and everyone in the organization should be congratulated about that. I guess perhaps the negative is, do you think that you could sustain this level of performance now with an Food and Household into the future? What do you see as the key risk to that performance? The related question is, with steel pricing having gone up quite a bit into 2008 and 2009, do you worry at all about conversions out of food cans and to other substrates over time?
John Hayes: To address the first question, the answer is a bit like Scott was talking about aluminum. What we endeavor to do is pass forth all the price increases on the steel side of the business. So it's always tough to talk about margins in a business in which that's a business model. But in terms of absolute EBIT dollars, we, the guys have been doing a great job. We've gotten to the targets, we think, we can achieve. Is there some upside? There's always some upside. You're never perfect, but it is where we think it should have been when we made the U.S. can acquisition. As we go forward in terms of steel, it remains to be seen. What happens there, one of the issues around processed food is the Steel Food Can has a big installed-base in terms of processing. And for our customers to recapitalize that, that is a significant capital throw. And so yes, we always are concerned about substitution and talk with our suppliers all the time about being penny-wise and pound-foolish. But on the other hand, we haven't seen to date any meaningful change in package share mix in the food can market or in the Food market, I should say.
George Staphos: I guess the last question I had and I'll turn it over. You mentioned perhaps you added some capacity -- that you will have capacity in Alumi-Tek and Golden. Do you see, perhaps, a need to add capacity on trim cans? Are you pleased with what you have right there?
R. Hoover: I think we just have to watch the market in our written comments, in John's comments, we talked about specialty cans continuing to grow. And we intend to meet the market there. And so once in a while we're going to be doing that. I think we talked about what we're doing in California.
George Staphos: Was the demand where you thought it would be, Dave, on trim cans this year?
R. Hoover: I think that part is -- really we're not surprised by the market performance this year. It's a little stronger in mid-year [ph] with some of the promotions on 12-ounce, but especially we're in constant contact and it seems to still be doing well.
Scott Morrison: George, not only the slim but also, 16 and 24 has been growing. I had mentioned that we were seeing some double-digit growth in the specialty can side. And as Dave, we monitor that very carefully and very closely. And if it makes sense to invest, we certainly will invest and we're prepared doing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Feinman from Iridian.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: So your free cash flow so far is $371 million and you're saying it's going to be at least $500 million for the year. So that means you're going to get another $130 million in free cash. And then you said your net debt is going to be $2.5 billion. Right now, it's $21 million less than that. So you got $130 million in free cash flow and about $20 million increase in debt. So that's $150 million of cash in the fourth quarter that you're going to spend. So can I assume that's how much stock you going to buy back during in the fourth quarter?
Scott Morrison: I think that's directionally right. I said -- we said we'd buy at least $400 million of stock. So I think your numbers are directionally right.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Just a quick follow-up. A lot of the growth that you're seeing in Brazil and in China and in Europe, is it predominantly weighted towards any -- whether it's beer or soft drink or other teas or things of that nature? Could you maybe get us a little help as to what's been the big growth engine in the different regions?
John Hayes: I think they're different by each region. In China, what you're seeing is beer.
Scott Morrison: Recall we've talked about this before. Can is a search package mix and the beer segment is low single-digits, 4% plus or minus across the country, which is a large country obviously but there's a lot of room for growth in that, we're seeing it. We're also seeing verbal teas convert from 3-piece tinplate into 2-piece aluminum. And I guess to a lesser extent 2 piece steel with some of our the competitors doing that. So that's what's really driving in China. In Brazil, it's beer. And as I said, beer's growing strongly. Our customers are investing in it strongly and the Canada's taking market share mixed gains, which is good. And then in Europe, it really, at least, this year has been driven more by CST than it has been by beer. And it has to do more than most than Western Europe than Eastern Europe.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Can you remind us what the mix is in Europe for the soft drinks and beer?
Scott Morrison: It's approximately 50/50, just off the top of my head, I think it's 50/50. Maybe a little bit more, not about 50/50, maybe a little bit more CSD than beer, but not much.
Operator: And our last question is a follow-up from Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: I think I caught you -- and tell me if I was wrong that you said CapEx for the year would be about $300 million. Is that right?
Scott Morrison: It's approaching $300 million.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: I was just curious because I remember back in, I think in July or August, it was supposed to be something close to, say 230. When did that change? Or is this something that you're changing today?
Scott Morrison: Well a change in part with the consolidated of Brazil and we're putting a second line in our Tres Rios plant. And then we announced the Alumi-tek line in Golden, so that bumps it up a bit. And there's some other smaller things, but those are the two big drivers of that number.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: But you really hadn't updated the market really specifically on this number until today just so I make sure I didn't miss it?
Scott Morrison: That's correct, you didn't miss anything.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions from the phone lines at this time.
R. Hoover: Okay, Jennifer, thank you so much for being a great hostess, and I thank all of you for tuning in to our call. And we'll look forward to speaking with you in January.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Dave Hoover, Chief Executive Officer. You may go ahead, sir.
R. Hoover: Thank you, Franz, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2010 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't have our earnings release, it's available on our website, which is at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is John Hayes, Ball's President, Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott's going to comment on our financial performance for the quarter and for 2010, and then John will follow details about our operating performance. Ball reported strong second quarter results. Increasing volumes across our Packaging businesses, strong operating performance and positive contributions from the strategic actions we've been taking during the last couple of years led to our improved results. During the quarter we closed our acquisition of the JFP joint venture plan in China, and we announced our agreement to sell our Plastics business to Amcor for $280 million in cash. We also increased our authorization to repurchase up to 12 million shares. Also in the quarter, Ball published its second corporate sustainability report, highlighting progress on our goals in five key areas of focus which are: Packaging, energy, water and waste, safety and talent management. You can read the report and expanded details on ball.com. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, the largest North American manufacturer of metal discs that are made into extruded aluminum bottles and containers used for personal care and beverage products. Well, we're very pleased with our strengthening performance this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dave. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, well ahead of last year's $1.14, a more than 20% improvement. Volume improvements in our Global Metal Packaging businesses, efficient plant operating performance and disciplined cost controls contributed to the improved results. These positive factors were offset somewhat by a higher interest cost, a higher effective tax rate. A weaker euro negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. At present rate, the FX headwinds are expected to increase in the second half of the year. The Plastics business is now reflected under discontinued operations at our financial statements. The sale resulted in a charge of approximately $76 million in the second quarter. The bulk of this charge is related to goodwill impairment. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. Turning to some key financial metrics. Interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four metal beverage plants. And an extra month of interest expense from carrying both the new bond issued in March and the 2012 notes we redeemed into April. We still anticipate full year interest expense to be approximately $140 million. Given the improvement seen to date in our North American packaging operations, we expect the full year tax rate to be around 33%. At current exchange rates, year end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, essentially where we ended 2009, or on a comparable basis, we're down over $200 million due to the AR securitization being reflected on the balance sheet. Even without the cash flow, we would have historically generated in the second half of the year from our Plastics business, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $0.5 billion in 2010, excluding the impact of the AR securitization coming out of the balance sheet. As stated in this morning's press release, and as a result of our strong free cash flow, we expect to repurchase an excess of $400 million of our stock during 2010. As of today's conference call, we have acquired $250 million of stock this year. Our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure are where we want to be, so expect us to return a majority of our free cash flow through share repurchases absent other significant strategic opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to John to talk more about the operations.
John Hayes: Thanks, Scott. The optimism we felt heading into the busy summer season has materialized in the strong second quarter results. In our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas and Asia segment, profitability for the quarter exceeded our expectations with EBITDA of $114.5 million versus $74.8 million in the second quarter last year. This was driven largely by the impact of the acquired plants, excellent plant performance and strong volume trend in CSD [carbonated soft drink], certain specialty sizes and the emerging Craft Beer category. Key U.S. retailers led significant promotional activity around the Memorial Day holiday, and that activity provided a volume lift relative to our expectations throughout the quarter. These promotions were in place for the Fourth of July holiday as well, but it appears that they have subsided somewhat. Best practice sharing and plant floor information system upgrades continue to drive efficiency gains in our plants. Our strong position in the specialty can arena and focus on innovation are providing opportunities for our customers to launch new products in the U.S., and our ability to respond to the growing needs of the Craft Brewing segment, all have contributed to improving volume trends.  In China, both the overall market, as well as Ball saw strong double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demands continue to be the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. The newly acquired JFP plants will play a pivotal role in being able to supply the growing demand for beverage cans in Southern China. We have a variety of opportunities to improve this new facility without spending significant capital, and the payback will exceed Ball's hurdle rate by the year end 2011. Double-digit volume growth continues in Brazil. We've had a very close relationships with established partners there for a long time, and the three plants in our joint venture are performing well. We continue to evaluate further growth opportunities in this region. But as always, we'll do it in conjunction with secured customer contracts. In our European operations, trends are also positive. Results in the quarter were EBIT of $72.5 million versus $64.8 million in the second quarter last year, on volumes that were up mid-single digits percent. This was offset by lower export volume and a slight FX translation headwind, which Scott mentioned earlier. A rebound in specialty can demand also provided improved price cost mix for the quarter. We mentioned in the news release encouraging signs in Germany for the return of the beverage can. Several significant discounters in Germany began relisting beverage cans in their outlets during the second quarter, which helped to increase the total industry can sales in that country by more than 30% year-to-date and more than 50% in the second quarter. Obviously, that is on a base smaller than what we would like, but it is another step forward and we continue to work with retailers and others to bring back this important market. As in the Americas, Asia segment we expect earnings improvement albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in that segment. Our Food and Household Packaging Products segment continued to perform very well. Volumes in the food side of the business were up low- to mid-single digits in the quarter, with aerosol volumes experiencing mid- to high-single digits growth both for the industry as well as for Ball. Second quarter year-over-year EBIT of $33.4 million versus $35.1 million was down slightly but against a difficult year-over-year comparison due to inventory holding gains recorded in the second quarter of 2009. The segment had another solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance, product mix and the improved volume trends mentioned earlier. While food volumes have also rebounded nicely, the fresh packed crops are behind schedule by a couple of weeks especially the tomato crop. That being said, the Food and Household segment is running ahead of expectations and all indications are that this segment will have another solid year in 2010. We'll just look for some cooperation from the weather as we head into the pack season. Dave mentioned Neuman Aluminum. We acquired that business this week, and it is a great strategic addition to our Food and Household Packaging segment. Neuman supplies more than 90% of the aluminum discs, called slugs, used to make extruded aluminum bottles in North America. It brings us technology, an entry further up the supply chain into an adjacent market. Neuman isn't a big acquisition in terms of size but it fits well within our portfolio, and we intend to leverage its capabilities to help us grow this segment. Aerospace segment second quarter earnings of $18.6 million were up from last year's $14.8 million on essentially flat revenue. Strong program performance on existing fixed priced programs made up most of the difference. As we have indicated throughout the year, recent contract wins will likely not have a big earnings impact in the second half of 2010, but they do firm up the backlog and set us up nicely going into 2011. Those glimmers of future contracts awards noted in the first quarter conference call are slowly starting to move forward through the process. So stay tuned as we progress through the year. In summary, our plants are running very well, packaging volume trends continue to improve and numerous opportunities exist for us to prosecute prudently. We're in a strong position operationally as we head into the second half of the year and we will expect to see good momentum continue into 2011. Dave?
R. Hoover: Thank you, John, and thank you, Scott, for your comments as well. We're pleased with our performance so far this year and while we expect the positive momentum to continue, we recognize that the world economy still faces challenges. But so far, so good for Ball. We continue to seek opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions, rest assured that we're going to remain focused on maintaining our track record of disciplined, balanced capital deployment. Last year, from continuing operations adjusted for the sale of the Plastics business, we made $3.92 for the full year. In the first half of this year, the comparable earnings were $2.25, a very strong performance. And we're going to do our best to meet or exceed the first half performance in the second half of 2010.  And with that, Franz, I believe we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George Staphos: I guess the question I had to start with, could you go back through what the volume growth was, if you can provide or if you have it, if you could give us some color for the United States or North American beverage and also in Europe. And then separately, for both regions, what types of operating rates do think you'll be at for the whole of 2010?
John Hayes: George, this is John. Why don't I try and tackle that. I think we mentioned on the first quarter call that -- I'll talk North American first, North American beverage. We ran our business as a system, and we've had volumes moving around within our newly acquired facilities and our existing facilities. So it's difficult to separate out. Having said that, we acquired relatively full-out plants from Metal Container nine months ago or so. If you take those out of the equation, our remaining plants were about down 3% or so for the quarter. But as we also said in the first quarter, as we go into 2010 and '11, in 2010 we stepped back in terms of some of our volumes over the last 18 months or so related primarily to the plant closures, remember Kent, Washington and Kansas City among others, and we're trying to be a bit more disciplined. Having said that, going into 2011, we expect to be up relative to the market as we rebalance our customer portfolio. Over in Europe, some of the trends that we saw, certainly in Western Europe continued. It was up high single digits, I think in the 8% or so range. Eastern Europe was a bit soft, I think the economy is not improving in Eastern Europe relative to Western Europe and there's a bit of a lag there. But overall, we were up mid-single digits. Our exports remain a bit soft but some of our bigger markets including the Netherlands and the U.K. were up quite nicely and there's been good weather in Europe in addition to the World Cup. So we feel relatively constructive as we go into the second half of the year, that the trends we saw in the second quarter will continue.
George Staphos: Would it be fair, John, that operating rates were more or less around the mid-90s in both regions?
John Hayes: Yes. As you know, the seasonality plays a factor in it but we were running hand to mouth in North America and Europe in the second quarter. And certainly, as we go into 2011, we expect it to be full out.
George Staphos: One, what opportunities are next perhaps for specialty can, either within traditional markets like CSD or perhaps even for Craft beers. And then one other concern at least that we've heard in the marketplace, is that given the high stepping-off point that's created by this year's retailer promotions that next year is up against much tougher comparison. It sounds like again that given some in the volume work you've been doing, you don't seem terribly concerned about that for 2011?
John Hayes: I don't think -- I'll tackle that last question first. I don't think we're terribly concerned, it's a bit premature to talk about 2011. But even with some of the promotional activities, let's remember that the overall can market is flat. So it's not like we've seen a big bump up relative to certainly last year's comps. And so as we go into 2011, I think the CSD and the beer people are looking at the value versus volume equation. We can tell you that the can had taken a little bit of share relative to other packaging substrates in some of those markets but I don't think any meaningful deviations have occurred. On the specialty side, we continue to see strong interest in a whole variety of different sizes. As you know, this year with the big CSD customer, we launched a 7.5-ounce container. We're seeing strong growth in some of the smaller sizes, as well as some of the larger sizes. Remember 2009, the larger sizes, largely on the energy drink side were impacted because of the housing downturn and the people were purchasing much less at the C-store [convenience store] level. We're seeing that starting to come back and so we continue to believe that our good position in the specialty side will continue to give us benefits as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Claudia Hueston, JP Morgan.
Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You've said the balance sheet is sort of where you want it to be, and obviously buybacks seem to be a priority. But could you just talk a little bit about where acquisitions fit and maybe just comment a little bit more on the motivation behind the Neuman acquisition.
R. Hoover: This is Dave. Acquisitions, as you know us, Claudia, and as you go back over many years, we've been able to find value, acquire it, integrate it, take on debt, pay down debt, buy stock and so forth. It's something we understand, know how to do. We are continuing to look for value-creating acquisitions. And as Scott mentioned in his comments, we think our leverage is certainly at a very comfortable level. So even though we said we're going to buy more than $400 million in stock this year, that certainly not going to be a hindrance to our being able to execute acquisitions. We're well-financed and in good shape, flowing a lot of cash.
John Hayes: On the Neuman Aluminum side, it's a very good business with technology that allows us to participate in this adjacent market. It does provide good opportunities to pursue the aluminum aerosol market, which you know we also do tin plate on the aluminum side, so there's a customer leverage point there. We acquired it on financial terms that are quite attractive and we're going to exceed our cost to capital in the first year. And also, it does play well into our initiatives around sustainability and recycling. So as we said, it wasn't a big acquisition and we paid approximately $60 million. But it does give us a lot of various options as we go forward to help grow our business in a part of the space that we understand quite well.
R. Hoover: Not only here but globally as well.
Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then I was just hoping you could also just comment on Germany, and how we should think about sort of your ability to meet sort of the additional demand that seems to be coming online there?
John Hayes: This was very good news in the second quarter and as I said off of a very low base, it was still up 50%. There's a number of big-box retailers in Germany and the number three and number four retailers are the ones that have been listing, so that's good news. We'd love to see number one and number two but that's for tomorrow, not today. We believe as we look forward that we have the ability to optimize our system to provide growth in that market as we go forward. As you know, that's a very important market to us and we're going to make sure that we have the necessary capacity in place. I think you should not expect us to be spending capital in that region. We can do various speed ups and optimization projects, without adding a lot of capacity and get more out of the system. It varies by the seasonality of the business as well, but we feel quite confident that we'll be able to service that market as it continues to grow.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Given the World Cup, which I assume, at least somewhat impacted your European business favorably. Have you seen any sort of fade in Europe, post the World Cup, in terms of volumes?
John Hayes: Not really at all. As I said, in the first quarter of this year, Eastern Europe was strong. And in fact stronger than we expected, but that was off a very week comp in first quarter '09. Second quarter was soft a bit and all of our indications is more economically driven where the economies are not recovering as fast, and there's a bit of a delay relative to Western Europe. But that aside, yes, there probably was a bit of a bump. It was good to see the Netherlands in the finals and Spain in the finals as well. So there's probably a little bump but it's very difficult to quantify but the trends we saw in the second quarter continue into the third quarter.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And just separately, one of your competitors in North America noted yesterday that they anticipate some share loss in '11, as part of contract renegotiations but they expect to recover that lost volume within three years. It seems like the entire industry is sort of moving volumes between each other, they somewhat diversified the customer mix, and that's helping to a certain extent. But is this some sort of new norm for the beverage can industry in your view? And more importantly, how do you manage your capacity footprint in the context of all these movements?
R. Hoover: From Ball's perspective, this was a bit of a deliberate activity over the past couple of years and we've talked about that in the past, certainly in the first quarter call. I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, most of our volumes are contracted under long-term contracts, so we believe that generally speaking, we're going to be entering into a period of relative volume stability, where over the past couple of years hasn't been as stable as it historically have been for Ball.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel, Keybanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: First, if we could ask a little bit about Neuman Aluminum. Could you give us maybe a little more color there? I'm sure it's probably going to show up in the Q in the next few days, but maybe how much you paid for the acquisition? Do you have any intentions through time? I know you just mentioned getting into the aluminum aerosol markets, but your -- I think this just makes slugs, if memory serves. Is there the ability to actually make some cans or bottles as well, or kind of what your plan is there?
R. Hoover: John just mentioned that we paid about $60 million for the acquisition. It does not have capacity to manufacture cans but it is a supplier to the people who do, and it was described as adjacent in the supply chain to that. I think it's fair to say that our long-term interest is in that part of the business, not only here but around the world. We just feel it's a good fit and place that we have a strong interest in. And we'll be prosecuting that interest but we haven't made any decisions yet to do anything, but certainly you shouldn't be surprised if we do. John, would you add anything to that?
John Hayes: I think that's a good summary. The long-term intent wasn't necessarily just to get in the slug business. It's probably something more. And as we develop those plans, people will probably hear about them.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: The second question I had was, as you look at the beer market, I think you mentioned particularly being a little bit weak in Eastern Europe. As we look at some of the other substrates, they're down notably more than what you're citing as a little bit of softness, it's a lot more than just soft. Is there anything going on potentially from a substrate perspective of shifts between, say, cans to glass to plastic, et cetera, that's favoring the bev [beverage] can today?
John Hayes: I think not only in Eastern Europe but in many parts of the world, we have seen over the past 12 to 18 months shifts in packaging materials that have been favoring the can. We've seen it in Asia, we've seen it in South America, we've seen a touch of it here in North America. And again in Europe, as you said so. I don't think it's just unique to one area. But the can has been gaining shares because I think people are recognizing that it's one of the best packages in the supply chain from a value and sustainability perspective.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon from Crédit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: Could you first, just so we don't overcount the sales, you mentioned in the press release Neuman sales. But I would imagine some of those sales are already going to Ball, can you give us some idea of what that is?
R. Hoover: None of the sales go to Ball. And I think we said in the press release, annual sales the last time measured were about $128 million.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: Secondly, when you sort of stepped back and look at 2011, 2012, I mean obviously, this year has been more about assimilating Metal Container and you just increase your presence in the Chinese joint venture. Are you thinking more proactively about adding new lines as one of your competitors has kind of done, I guess, on an accelerated basis the last couple of years? And do you think it will be more likely we'd see activity in both China and Brazil or maybe you would favor one market over the other?
R. Hoover: I think you are seeing activity in both those markets from us. In Brazil, we opened a new plant the first of the year, we're installing a second line in that plant and are adding as we contract for business, long-term contract for business capacity. The new plant has room for at least one more line and there may be other possibilities. And in China, I think that market, particularly driven by the beer and the tea business, affords us continuing opportunity. We've been in China since 1985. And we've got a large market share there and certainly intend to continue to prosecute it. We also would look elsewhere in Asia if the opportunity will arrive, we can contract and if we can make a good return. So I don't think we favor one place over another, what we really look for is the opportunity.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: I think lastly, when you look at the Aerospace segment, which we don't focus on, I guess, enough on sometimes. You mentioned though that some of the recent contracts, and how that could actually help 2011. Is it too early to give us an idea as to how you could sort of see these contracts kind of phase in? Maybe when we look at year-over-year EBIT comparisons next year. Is it like more back end loaded or spread the improvement over the year?
John Hayes: It really is too early to comment. As we said, we have a variety of proposals out. We always expected -- come the third quarter that's when the rubber would be meet the road. And we're at that point right now and we feel constructive about some of them. Some of them have been pushed out to the right because of because the government's decision-making process, I'll call it. But it is premature to talk about, it's quarter-by-quarter certainly in 2011.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse AG: And then lastly in Germany, you all talked about improvement there, how kind of far -- is zero a sort of a bottom and 100 was sort of where you were before the change in the deposit laws over there, how far back up has it recovered? And do you think you can get all the way back eventually?
R. Hoover: Let me put it this way. Back before the deposit, it was about a 7.5 billion to 8 billion can market, of which about 1 billion were exported out of Germany. So call it 6.5 billion, 7 billion of consumed in the country. It got down to low of a couple hundred million units afterwards. And it wasn't -- but two or three years ago, that was still only about 500 million for the year that were consumed in Germany. Through the first six months of this year, it's 500 million. So over the past couple of years, we've effectively doubled what it is. And so the future will be what the future is, but we're feeling a lot more constructive today than we have in the past relative to cans getting back on the shelves in Germany.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just maybe a question for Scott, specifically, since the end of the second quarter, I think you said you had repurchased 250 million year-to-date of shares versus, I think, what was 140 million in the cash flow statement, so you've repurchased 110 million in the third quarter so far. Just wanted to verify that? And then what's your share count as of today?
Scott Morrison: Since the end of the quarter, we have repurchased another 110 million. That's how I got to the 250 million, year-to-date. And we plan to continue that, the purchases to get us to at least 400 million for the year. The share count as of year-to-date, I'll come back to you on that. I don't have the exact number listed today.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: While you look for that, maybe, how are you thinking about the term loan. I guess the $250 million term loan that's either due this year or next, are you thinking of repaying that with proceeds from the Plastic sale or terming that out again?
Scott Morrison: If you look at our free cash flow, we always said this year, we've got about $250 million of term loan payments this year that would come out of free cash flow. The rest of that free cash flow being used to repurchase shares, and then the bulk of the proceeds from the Plastic sale to use to repurchase shares. So we see that payment coming out of free cash flow. And shares outstanding, as of the end of the quarter, were 91.5 million.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: One question for John. I think you mentioned in your comments that you've seen some, perhaps development with cans in the Craft Brews, just wondered if you could discuss that a little further. Are you seeing that accelerate, are you seeing some of the Craft Brews move away from glass into cans?
John Hayes: The answer to both of those question is yes, absolutely. I don't have the exact numbers on, but the growth of the can in the Craft segment is quite strong. There's over 2,000 Craft brewers in America, but you're seeing a lot of the big ones to start to go in. Here in Colorado, there's New Belgium, there's Oskar Blues, that have really been pushing it strongly. We continue to see those trends improve, and in fact, several major publications over the last six months, there has been a various articles about the resurgence of cans as a premium package in the Craft Brewing segment. So I think all that chatter we hear from our various customers and new potential customers is bullish relative to Craft Beer going into cans.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: As you see the discussion around the Craft Brews are some of the more national premium beers, having discussions with you with regards to moving some of their volume into cans?
John Hayes: We don't comment necessarily on specific customer types of things, but as an industry, generally speaking, the Craft Brewing Industry does have interest in cans.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: I wondered if you can just walk us through the impact of tin prices going up. I know there's not a lot of tin in tinplate, but if you could talk to us about the implications of those higher prices for both tinplate, and then the competitiveness of your packaging?
John Hayes: As you pointed out, tin is a small part of the overall tinplate. When we talk with our suppliers around the price of tinplate steel, we talk about the price as tinplate steel, not about necessarily the varied components of it. There is a level of -- the cost inputs play an important factor in that. But it's also about the supply and demand of steel generally speaking. So to summarize, we don't specifically talk about the cost of the tin going into tinplate.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: So based on what we've seen so far in the tin market, recently, you wouldn't expect that, that's going to be a real plus push element on tinplate. Is that correct?
John Hayes: Everyone faces cost going up and going down. And so the only thing I can comment is we buy tinplate, our discussions are around the cost of tinplate.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: As you're exiting the Plastic business, I wondered if you guys have any thoughts on sort of lessons learned from that business?
R. Hoover: We learned that if you invest money in places that don't make their return on the cost of capital, it's not as good if you do invest money in investments that's earn on their cost of capital.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Just generally, Dave, I mean, any kind of things you walked away from and look at and say this is kind of a lesson we've learned as we grow in Packaging?
R. Hoover: No. I think a few things. I think about all that. We didn't get into it, thinking that we were going to perform as we have. The market has changed quite a bit over the last couple of years, and particularly on the CSD and water side, and as we look at in the future. So consolidation was an appropriate thing to have happened in the market. We did not believe that, where we were positioned, it makes sense for us to be the consolidator, and it's as simple as that. We had a great plants. We did make money and we flow a lot of cash out of that business over the years that we had it. But as we got to making the decision, I think, what happened for us is going to be very good as we look into the future, and what has happened for the person that bought this, the company that bought it, you've got help to them. Not that, that's our goal necessarily just to help our competitors or other companies, but it's a situation where we've got lots of good people in that business who worked really, really hard and the market just wasn't ever set up, so that we could earn. I think what you have to try to figure out is where you can have advantage in whatever you do. And in the kind of businesses that we're in, are slug it out, tough businesses. Cost is very important. You got to do everything as near perfectly as you can to satisfy customer need. But there's no doubt in my mind that we've got lots of opportunity now, particularly on the Metal side of the business all around the world. The things that we're looking at and the possibilities including organic growth, including acquisitions, and we're flowing lots of cash. The company's is in a wonderful shape. I can see it improving over the next few years, just from the hand that we're dealt right now. So borrowing some unforeseen events, this company is in good strong position, and that business just didn't fit our portfolio anymore.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Question on Europe. What was the growth rates of -- or what were the growth rates of specialty versus the conventional cans in the quarter and what is the composition of the total, i.e., how much is specialty now in Europe?
John Hayes: I don't have that rate in front of me, but if you define specialty as anything other than 33 centiliter or 50 centiliter, that's growing and growing at a rate to 2x to 3x the overall market. 50 centiliter is typically the beer package and 33 is the soft drink package. Beer has been a bit soft if you look at some of the results, the global brewers have put out, you can see it in there. So the 33 has performed well, but some of the other ones, 15 centiliter for soft drink has performed well, some of the larger sizes five, six, eight for energy drinks, things like that. And they've been growing at a rate faster than the 33 and 50's.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Presumably then, if you look at the kind of EBIT improvement year-on-year, I'm guessing mix was a positive. What about, how was price cost if you just kind of look at it a year-on-year bridge? And you kind of rank it? You mentioned the FX headwind, but how would you kind of rank the other drivers?
John Hayes: Our folks has been doing a wonderful job in terms of cost optimization in our plants. We've seen a lot of very continued good improvement at the plant level. In terms of price, there wasn't a lot of price gains necessarily. So I think the majority of the gains and profitability had to do with volume and with cost improvements.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: And then switching to the U.S., you mentioned a lot of positive factors there, a lot of heavy promotional activity, bottle's talking more and more about changing the kind of the price park or the price park architecture. You can argue it's almost a countercyclical business. And despite all that, I think the industry, in general, if it grew 1%, it wasn't much more than that in the first half of the year. So as you look forward, I mean, is this going to be an industry that, kind of in the perpetuity is stuck at this 95 billion to 100 billion cans a year, and you just manage it accordingly? I know you wouldn't bill it as a, "growth industry." But I guess what gets this go -- where do you get growth going forward? And I'm just curious, again, how you would manage capital accordingly in that business?
Scott Morrison: I think in North America, as you're speaking, we don't view necessarily it as "growth market". You have to understand, you are who you are. We do think there's growth pockets. We talked about specialty, we talked Craft Brewing and we talked about the market share gains even in the Beer segment. CSD, some of the larger CSDs, customers are trying to figure out how to reinvigorate the growth. In fact, every one of them has specific plans in doing that. They're in the midst of implementing them. And as we go forward, who knows what it is but we also recognize it. Probably won't be a growth market in terms of the CSD side, but on the standard container. But on some of the specialty ones, we've seen growth in those segments offset some of the climbs we've seen in 12 ounce.
R. Hoover: I think as to how that causes us to allocate capital, you see us generating $500 million in free cash. Likely growth opportunities then in terms of where markets are growing, aren't right here. At the same time, we've got very good install base, a very good system. Our plants are very, very good. So when we do spend capital, it's to maintain the good positions that we have and/or one-off opportunities like the Alumi-Tek bottled can that we're manufacturing and/or the new small cans for soft drink. First on who we may commit capital for growth within a market, that overall, may not necessarily be growing. Remember, we've closed a number of facilities in this industry over the last decade or so, including a couple within the last two years. So I think what John said is you have to know who you are and where you are. We can make lots of money and pull lots of cash in a nice flat can market in North America. That's what I would tell you.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: As we look at the market in Germany, if we were to see what's a couple of billion cans come back to that market over next 18, 24 months. I have a question, is there a capacity in place to respond to that? And if not, how quickly could you get capacity running up to respond to it?
R. Hoover: Let's not forget, we have our Lublin facility that we have not talked about turning back on stream. And that provides a lot of option value for us in that, and where we stand today is where we stood at the end of the first quarter. We've seen some growth in the market. Germany is quite helpful and it's been growing, but is it enough to turn on Lublin, right now? No, it's not enough. But we monitor that very closely, and we have plans in place that if the market does continue to grow quite strongly, that we can service the demand there.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: At this point, an idea of -- as we do look out within three to five years, how much of that loss 6.5 billion, 7 billion can market, do you think it can come back or it's too early to say?
R. Hoover: It's just too early to say. The can really hadn't been on the market in any meaningful way for approximately eight years. And so there is a bit of reeducation by the consumer. And because of that, it is just premature to predict anything.
Scott Morrison: But we like what's going on.
R. Hoover: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I was wondering if you could clarify on Eastern Europe, specifically, what you saw, sort of, for beverage can volumes?
R. Hoover: Generally speaking, it was off mid to upper-single digits. It depends by country. I'm excluding Russia in this, although I think Russia was off about 8%, which is consisted with the rest of Eastern Europe. It really did. The weather wasn't as good there in Western Europe, but I wouldn't attribute it for that. It's just a function of the economies in that region we're on such a growth there. It came off very strong in the second half of '08 and '09, there's a lag relative to Western Europe, and I think we're just seeing that lag right now in terms of economic recovery.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: In the latter part of the quarter or maybe recent trends, have you seen any pick up that is there? And if you could just comment generally about your volume trends throughout the quarter if there was any appreciable changes there?
John Hayes: No, there really were not any appreciable changes in volume trends through those, sequentially, through the quarter. I'm just trying to think by region. I can't think of anything on top of our head.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: So Europe's still kind of trending down that mid- to upper-single digit, it sounds like?
John Hayes: Not Europe. That's just Eastern Europe...
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: I'm sorry, Eastern Europe.
John Hayes: Yes, Overall, Europe is up in mid-single digits.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And was there any appreciable difference between beer and soft drinks and can volumes that you noticed in Europe?
John Hayes: Nothing appreciable.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Switching to North America about cans, you mentioned promotional activity starting to taper off more recently, have you seen a corresponding slow down in your volumes as a result of that?
R. Hoover: A little bit, but this comes with ebs and flows. We've got the Labor Day weekend coming up in a month time. And with the chatter we hear in the industry that there may be promotions there again. And so it comes and goes, so I wouldn't read into it too much. The only thing that we can say is there was continual promotion from Memorial Day through 4th of July, and for the most part, it was discontinued after the 4th of July. But that doesn't it won't pick up again.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And then on food can volumes, I think you said mid- to high-single-digit growth, if I got that right, which would be quite a bit better than the overall industry. And I was wondering if you could comment on that and if you think that trend will be sustainable?
John Hayes: No, that is not correct. I think the overall industry was up 3% or 4% in the food cans, and we are consistent with that. Where we're up higher, and the industry was up higher, was on the Aerosol side. And that was in the 8%-plus-or-minus range of growth, not only for us but also for the industry where you saw a lot of destocking last year. People are starting to put things back in their garages and pantries.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And then as it relates to the earnings in the segment, it was quite a bit higher than I would have expected given the difficult comp. Was there anything out of the ordinary there that might helped earnings?
Scott Morrison: We had wonderful operational performance at the plants.
R. Hoover: The strong volume obviously helped too.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Peter Ruschmeier, Barclays Inc.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: On Germany, can you remind us Lublin. How much capacity is there if you decide to ramp up back up?
John Hayes: Lublin is in Poland, but we've never even started it up. But whatever it allowed us to do is service some of our Polish volume that's currently bringing serve out of Germany, we'd be able to do that. And given that we haven't started it up, as you all know, the first line you can get out of the blocks, probably 700 million cans and that would grow over time as you optimize that line, and then each incremental line is about the same.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: So would you consider putting more capital to work on the ground in Germany, John or Dave?
R. Hoover: I think what we do if it really start to take off, we'd optimize our system in terms of freight and other things, going across borders of between countries.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And just to get this one question out the way, how do you think about new markets, India, other markets, do you put much emphasis on that or are you really happy with your current footprint in terms of growing?
R. Hoover: We're looking everywhere in the developing world. We've got strong positions in China and in Brazil, and they're both growing. But there are other parts of the world where there are lots of people and not many cans, and so we're looking all the time. We're also conscious of the fact that a building they-will-come strategy in this industry makes no sense. So if we go to some place new, we're going to have contracts at volumes over a long enough period of time that we believe we can get there and be solid. But we think over time, these economies are going to continue to keep growing. They're going to continue to create a stronger middle class that has more purchasing power. We're going to be following our customers, our good customers. I think from time to time, we're adding capacity on those markets.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: And then Dave, I was wondering if you could weigh in on the buyback again. I guess in the past, you certainly been willing to lever up at times for the right acquisition. And I guess, the question is the degree to which you consider levering up to buy your own shares rather than just using free cash flow? How do you think about the puts and takes?
R. Hoover: I have conversations with Scott Morrison about that all that time. No, I mean, seriously, what Scott said and where we are, we're telling a couple of things today. One is that we're looking all the time to buy things. But we're very disciplined about that, and we're going to selectively invest in our business and we're just good about that. But we're flowing enough cash in our balance sheet right now, and if there's anything we got a little less than that we need. So my judgment on this is we're just fine and that's why we're telling you, it's more 400 million this year. How much more? I don't know. But Scott could you tamper me a little bit?
Scott Morrison: No, I would agree. We're in a fortunate position. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Our capital structures is where we want it to be. So in these times in the past, we've already had the most net free cash flow to buying back stock until that next opportunity comes along. We've been able to buy things in the last year or so, and our cash flow has been so strong that our debt actually gone down. So we're in a good place, and we can be opportunistic.
R. Hoover: You've heard us say before if we get down to one share. I just hope I own it.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Within your free cash flow guidance, Scott, can you comment on what you've incorporated for working capital for the second half of the year, I guess, normally it's a big source of cash, I would assume that, that's fair this year as well?
Scott Morrison: Actually last year was a use of cash. This year will be a slight source of cash for the full year.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
George Staphos: In terms of specialty cans, realizing that last year there was some puts and takes. And obviously, there's some definitional problems in trying to quantify what the actual amount of volume by size, et cetera. What do you think your year-on-year changes out of year-to-date or in the quarter, especially cans, number one, both in the U.S. and Europe if you have that? And then are you out of capacity within your ability to produce for any of these markets, much need to put on some capacity for slim cans for example, if that products been doing very well?
John Hayes: George, my apologies in advance because I don't have the specific numbers in front us. But in North America, the specialty volumes have been growing approximately in the upper single digits if I remember it correctly. And yes, in terms of some of the sizes, we are bumping up against capacity constraints. And so what we've been doing as you know in the specialty side is typically, unless it's Alumi-Tek, as David mentioned earlier, we look to convert 12 ounce if that makes sense to do some of the smaller specialty sizes. And if there's real growth opportunities, we might look at doing something else if we need to. In Europe, I think, I mentioned it before, other than 33 and 50s, it has been growing more than 2x the overall growth. And it varies by country, and it varies by CSD versus beer, the CSD isn't growing a little bit faster than the beer has over, on specialty sizes, over in Europe. And so that's the key takeaways, I think.
George Staphos: John, I mean, one-time ago, there was something called spin flow which allowed, it never really worked well from what I can recall, but allowed you to change diameters on cans, at least, it supposed to happen on the fly, is there anything from a manufacturing standpoint where you could actually have a beverage can line that could swing pretty quickly between traditional 12 ounce and your standard if that is a -- I'm asking more on standard specialty can sizes?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Mr. Hoover you're back into the call, you may proceed.
John Hayes: Actually the specialty can has been growing in both Europe and the U.S. at a rate, at least year-to-date, 3x the amount of that. And so we're seeing double-digit growth in North America, and a busy tired even in Europe.
George Staphos: When you bring on new lines and specialty, is there a way where the capacity can be structured so it really can swing between traditional 12 ounce and specialty sizes?
John Hayes: Yes.
George Staphos: You mentioned that you expect European EBIT will be up at least in euro terms, I guess, the implication is we could see depending on what happens on currency, flat to down European EBIT the second half is that what you're suggesting?
Scott Morrison: Yes. If you look at the currency last year, from May on, the euro really strengthened. And so unless that happens again, we have a fairly sizable headwind from a euro conversion standpoint. But we think were making more money in euros, which is the translation that's hurting us.
George Staphos: What do you think your normalize free cash flow is? Do you think that $500 million is a sustainable rate or is it more something around $400 million? And I realize it's difficult to forecast into the future like that, but what are your thoughts at this juncture?
Scott Morrison: We expect it to still be around $500 million as we look forward, and improving. We think our businesses have opportunities to improve the earnings going forward, and we don't see big changes as it relates to what our working capital needs are. John talked about some opportunities and specialty in new geographies that might pop up our CapEx overtime, but not meaningfully.
John Hayes: I think, we think the earnings improvement in the business will be able to help fund any incremental capital?
Operator: Speakers there are no further questions at this time, you may resume with your presentation or closing remarks.
R. Hoover: Thank you, Franz, very much and thanks for calling us back. But thanks to all of you to signing in for the conference call. We look forward to speaking with you after the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does concludes the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation, and kindly ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, Chairman and CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
R. Hoover: Well, thank you, Suzy, and good morning, everybody. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding our first quarter 2010 results. The information to be provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at www.ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me today on the call is John Hayes, Ball's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Scott will provide key financial metrics for the quarter and for 2010, and John will follow with details about our operating performance.  While we reported strong first quarter results against some difficult comparisons last year when we had a net inventory holding gain in the range of $35 million. And also, as we described in our press release, we're seeing signs of growth in our packaging markets, which is very welcome. And during the quarter, our Aerospace segment saw an improving contract to work environment. We did announce earlier this month a new contract called GFO-2 [Geosat Follow-on 2 ] with significant potential and we're glad to see that begin to come in. So we hope to hear more about other proposals in that part of our business soon. And with that, Scott?
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Dave. In the first quarter, Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were at $0.85, well ahead of last year's $0.77. Drivers during the quarter were positive contributions from the four acquired beverage can plants in the fourth quarter of last year: Volume improvements in our packaging businesses, very good operating performance and cost controls, tax benefits realized on a foreign investment in Asia and a strong start in equity earnings in affiliates in Brazil and further strengthening expected during the remaining quarters of this year. These were offset somewhat by higher interest costs due to the acquisition financing from last year.  Aerospace segment first quarter earnings were down slightly on lower revenue. As mentioned on the last conference call, the trends in this business appear to be improving. While contract wins, including the one noted in the earnings release, will likely not have a significant impact on 2010, they do firm up staffing in the business and set us up nicely going into 2011. Turning to some key financial metrics, interest expense in the quarter was up as expected due to the acquisition financing from last year's purchase of the four Metal Beverage plants. While we still expect full year interest expense to be in the range of $140 million, excluding the impacts of the one-time interest costs associated with calling of the 2012 notes.  The first quarter effective tax rate of 20% was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax benefits earned on investments. As you are aware, the recognition of tax benefits tends to be a lumpy activity. We continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 32%. But our tax department historically has done a great job of finding opportunities.  The company's receivables securitization program is now being recorded as a balance sheet obligation, due to the effects of the accounting pronouncement I described in the January call. The impact for the quarter was an increase in accounts receivable of $250 million and an increase in debt. While the net balance sheet and total cash flow effect is zero, there was a one-time reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivables securitized and an offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. This change has been broken out as separate line items in the press release financials, as you can see the net change and comparability between periods.  During the quarter, we raised $500 million in new 6.75% notes due in 2020. On April 21, we used the proceeds of the new notes to retire $509 million and 6 7/8% notes due in 2012. Because of the timing of the new note issuance and the calling of the existing notes, our balance sheet reflects both debt issues and considerable cash on hand at the end of the quarter. The 2012 notes that were retired are shown as short-term debt at quarter end.  Also following January's earnings conference call, we announced the repurchase of $125 million of our stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. The program resulted in the delivery of 90% or 2.2 million shares on the execution day with the remainder to be delivered at the conclusion of the contract, which will occur during the next few months. Given our significant free cash flow expectations for 2010 which continue to be in excess of $500 million, we will increase the size of the share repurchase program during 2010. As always, we look to return value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the period that our accelerated share repurchase contract remains open, it is cumbersome to change the current dividend amount, but we continue to evaluate both of these mechanisms to ensure that we have the right mix.  With that, I'll turn it over to John.
John Hayes: Thanks, Scott. Ball delivered a strong first quarter. Global consumers appeared to be getting back on track. And that, along with balancing our supply and demand in our metal packaging businesses and very good and improving operating performance, makes us optimistic as we head into the busy summer selling season.  Profitability for the quarter of our metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia segment met our expectations and was notably improved over first quarter 2009. This was driven largely by the impact of the newly acquired U.S. plants and the lack of inventory holding losses recorded last year. Cost savings from prior plant rationalizations also contributed to improved results. Our CSD customers are fine-tuning the value versus volume equation, which is beginning to show up in the improving sequential CSD can volume trends in the first quarter.  In China, both the overall market as well as Ball saw double-digit volume growth rates in the quarter. Herbal teas and beer demand were the main catalyst behind the volume improvement. In Brazil, the startup of our new facility continues to go very well and it is sold out. We announced the addition of a second line in this facility and it should come on stream in early 2011. The market is performing very well. It's up mid-teens, and we continue to look for opportunities while remaining disciplined. We continue to expect 2010 profitability in the Americas and Asia segment to be improved. Driven by the contribution of three additional quarters of the acquisition that closed in October, cost savings resulted from the previously announced capacity closures. Our relentless focus on our cost optimization and best practice sharing activities continued growth from new innovative product launches like our 90-calorie mini soft drink can, improved penetration of the can into the Kraft brewing segment and improving volume trends in both the U.S. and China. In our European operations, volumes were up mid single-digit percent in the first quarter led by promising growth in both Western and Eastern Europe that was slightly offset by weaker export sales. Continued cost savings at the plant level also contributed to improved results. As in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement, albeit on a euro basis in 2010 in this segment. The business is beginning to prepare for World Cup promotional activities, so we'll wait to see how much of a positive impact this will have with our customers.  And Food and Household products segment continues to execute well. Volumes were up slightly above 3% in the quarter and many of our customers are off to a nice start. First year, year-over-year performance was down due to the lack of inventory holding gains recorded last year that Dave mentioned. However, even with that difficult comparison, the business had a very solid quarter due largely to excellent operating performance. While food and aerosol can volumes have rebounded, they are not yet back to historical levels. Continued volume growth and our disciplined approach to commercial activities offers upside for the remainder of this year and into 2011. Plastic packaging, Americas challenges continue. Lower volumes in the cold-fill CSD and water segments and manufacturing disruptions at a PVT plant due to a customer qualification occurrence led to an operating loss in the quarter. The manufacturing disruption is behind us and plants are catching up with the recent increased demand at the C store level. Also the food specialty plastic side of the business is seeing improved trends from our customer base. Ball Aerospace experienced somewhat softer sales in EBIT in the quarter, but also saw progress in contract integrations and, more importantly, new awards. This trend, if it continues, may provide a foundation for better results. Our antenna components and services businesses are maintaining good growth trajectory, and the hardware side of this business also has some glimmers of future contracts awards. So stay tuned here.  Company-wide, our operations are executing well in what appears to be the beginning of an improved global environment. Continued discipline around capital spending and working capital reductions will ensure the delivery of significant free cash flow, which is a major focus in 2010. During the past two years, we've taken numerous actions to improve performance in a difficult global environment while also positioning Ball for growth when the economy improves. Though we are not done with that process, in fact we're never done, we do like where we stand today with our manufacturing footprint and the leverage we can poll to grow as markets grow. Dave?
R. Hoover: Well, thank you, John, and thank you, Scott for your comments. While this year is only a third over now and we reported only the first quarter of it, we're experiencing building momentum and general improvement in our markets.  For the full year, we continue to expect the company's 2010 earnings to be above those of 2009. We're focused in pushing hard for improved results in cash flow. We've taken steps in our operations to improve profitability and position Ball for continued organic growth, as well as opportunities in developing markets. The balance sheet has been strengthened and we have additional flexibility as we evaluate the best ways to create significant value for all of our shareholders.  And with that, Suzy, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.
George Staphos: First question, did I hear you relate what North American volume was, John, in beverage cans? If you hadn't, could you relate it now?
John Hayes: Yeah, it gets a little bit difficult because as part of the acquisition, we're moving volumes in the system, so what was legacy and what were some of the formal metal containers. But as best we can tell in the legacy businesses, it was down low- to mid-single digits. And in the non legacy or the former Metal Container plants, the volume was quite strong. Recall at the end of the year, we talked about a slight step back in 2010. We're seeing a lot of promotional activity from our customers right now. And so as we go into the busy summer selling months, I think we have some good momentum, not only on the CSD side but also on the beer side, where we're seeing more promotional activity in that segment as well.
George Staphos: Did I also hear you say that this year you expect volumes -- and I took them as, if you will, same store- or same plant-adjusted volumes being up in North America because of what's happening with the customer base? And if not, could you give us a bit more color then?
John Hayes: No, I think what we see right now again in the same store, as you said it, we would expect to be down just a little bit. But that has to do relative to the overall market. And it largely has to do with what I said at the end of the January call about taking -- repositioning our portfolio, which will lead to improved volumes as we head into 2011.
George Staphos: I guess the last question – and I'll turn it over again on beverage. Is there any way at this juncture, if you assume a relatively flat North American industry, to gauge what your volume might look like in 2011 on a percentage growth basis, again in North American beverage? And then is it possible to put some relative weighting to the components that drove the margin improvement in the first quarter?
R. Hoover: I'll address the volume issue and maybe Scott can address the margin issue. On the volume issue, as we go into 2011, it's a bit premature. But as you know, we've stepped back in terms of some of our volumes over the past couple of years, related primarily to plant closures and trying to be a little bit more disciplined. As we go into 2011, we expect to be up relative to the market, as I said before, as we rebalance this customer portfolio, particularly on the CSD side. We're also seeing a lot of good improvement, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, on the innovation side of our business. The Craft beer segment, we're seeing a lot of tailwind there. Just several years ago, cans really weren't represented in that segment and now we're seeing good momentum there. With the 90-calorie, 7.5-ounce can that we've launched, that's going quite well as we sit here today. So all those factor into an improved environment as we go forward.
Scott Morrison: I would just add, George, that I could see if the economy improves a little bit, and not just the repositioning but also some of these other factors where our business which is pretty large now in North America, low- to mid-single digit volume growth next year.
George Staphos: And just on the margin components?
Scott Morrison: On the margin front in the first quarter in beverage, it would be either probably more normalized margins that we had. If you recall last year, we had some inventory losses. And if you went back to the previous year, we had some inventory gains. So these are more normalized margins. This is the last quarter that we'll see benefit from some of the previous rationalization that we did. And so going forward, we expect more stabilized performance.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Claudia Hueston from JPMorgan.
Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I was hoping you could just elaborate on the Plastics business and the operational issues you have there. You said they're sort of over now, was there any lingering impact into the second quarter that we should be aware of or was that pretty much resolved in the first?
R. Hoover: Yeah, this related to a specific incident in one of our plants and we were disqualified. And we worked through the quarter to become requalified. And that did occur late in the quarter, and so we certainly hope that that's behind us.
Scott Morrison: Yeah, all lines in all of our plants are running right now.
Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's great. That's helpful. And then I was hoping, just on the beverage cans side, you could just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in Europe, maybe just looking at some of the different geographies within Europe?
John Hayes: Yeah, actually, Europe is very much a good story in the first quarter. When you look at Western Europe, the overall market was up about 8%. And even in Eastern Europe, it was up higher than that, probably low single digits. Our overall volumes were a bit soft due to some of our expert business being soft. That was timing issues. But we expect that to rebound through the balance of the year. So we really are excited about the momentum as we head into the summer. We've got the World Cup in front of us. And you know, go U.K., go Germany, go France, go Netherlands, go Poland and go Brazil. But that usually does add some meaningful volume and the tone and tenor with our customers, as there's going to be a nice push. You know, we always have to worry about weather and things like that. But last year's weather was quite difficult throughout, not only Continental Europe but also up in the U.K. So as we sit here today, our management team feels pretty good as we go into the summer.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: John, the promotional activity you referred to, is that specific to beverage cans or should we expect that to flow through into plastics at some point? And also, are you seeing the promotional activity outside of North America as well?
John Hayes: The short answer is yes to both of those. I think on the CSD side here in North America, I mentioned the volume versus value equation. We're seeing it more on the can side than we are seeing on the PT side. But when you just look at what their pricing policies are through IRI data and other things, you can clearly see that the significant prices that the CSD segment's been going after over the last 18 months has moderated, and there is a lot of promotional activities, particularly at the big-box stores here in North America. As you go around to the rest of the world, obviously, it varies country by country and region by region. But we are seeing – you know, I think in Europe, the fact that Western Europe was up 8% and Eastern Europe was up more than that is a good telltale sign that the consumers are starting to get back into the game, and it's being helped by some moderated pricing by our customers.
R. Hoover: As you go to China and Brazil, it's up more.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, that's helpful. And also, one of your big customers seems to have switched to aluminum suppliers in the U.S., has that impacted you in any way in terms of access to aluminum?
Scott Morrison: No, not materially. It's nothing of note.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: I wonder in Europe, is there enough of a pickup visible to you that you can start to think about maybe some capacity decisions over there? I think you have had some capacity that you've been kind of sitting on in Eastern Europe.
R. Hoover: Yeah, and specifically, you're mentioning our Lublin plant that we had put on hold through the economic crisis. You know, what I would say is, not yet are we ready, but it's certainly on our radar screen. One thing I didn't mention, which is another positive development in Europe is – has to do with the German market. There are trials going on with some of the big-box stores there and putting cans back on the shelf. That if that occurs, we're going to have some issues. If it occurs in a large way, we're going to have some issues keeping up with volume demand. So that's obviously a good thing, and that would factor in to how we rebalance our European network and potentially start up Lublin.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: John, when would those decisions get made in Germany? Is there a timeline you can help us with?
John Hayes: Well, let me give you the context and that will probably be helpful. There's four to five significant big-box chains in Germany. There's one specifically that has a trial going on in 300 of its stores. There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of communication with the other big-box stores. So a lot more interest today relative to any time over the past six, seven, eight years since the deposit was implemented. And we'll just have to wait and see as we go forward. We're certainly not declaring victory, but the tone is much better than it's ever been.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG: The North American aerosol business, how's that doing? What are you seeing in terms of volume there?
R. Hoover: We're actually seeing improved volumes in that segment, and we feel very constructive going into the summer. There was clearly destocking in that segment, whether it was on the paint side of the business in the household products or even the beauty, and we are seeing that destocking largely over and we're seeing some pretty decent volumes with those customers you would expect as you go into the summer season.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Joe Naya from UBS.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Bank: I was just wondering what you saw in terms of trends with your specialty can business in the quarter?
John Hayes: Well, as I think I've mentioned it before, when we went through the economic crisis, we did see a slowdown in the specialty side of the business, but we've seen some renewed interest in it, whether it's on this new 90-ounce, 7.5 – excuse me, 7.5-ounce can that we have promoted. You're seeing the energy drinks starting to come back. You're seeing some of the non – some of the specialty products out there. The volume trends are certainly improving as the customer feels a little bit more constructive about the economy. So we feel pretty good where that business is right now.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Bank: I guess going forward with the Metal Container acquisition, that was really more heavily weighted towards the 12-ounce cans now, right? So I was just wondering how – what the best way to think about the relative impact of that specialty business is?
Scott Morrison: Well, obviously, by math, it's a lower percentage of our business than it was a year ago. The former Metal Container plants did have some specialty. They had the Squat-8 [ph] can and some other things, and we've been taking a look at how to leverage that relative to some new and innovative products. And so it's a little bit lower as a percent of our total portfolio today, but I think that the volume trajectory outlook hasn't changed. And I believe it's around 15% of our total portfolio today.
R. Hoover: Yeah, after giving effect to the acquisition.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: First, can you quantify what the impact was in the plastics business of getting disqualified in the disruptions that you mentioned?
John Hayes: Well, I think it contributed to well over half of the miss from last year.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then maybe just shifting topics, you're adding a can line in Brazil. You've got a competitor that's doing a couple of can lines in Brazil. Is there any concern that you have with regards to the capacity expansion situation that's unfolding in Brazil, specifically as it relates to your experience that you saw in Europe? And maybe what's different that you're seeing in Brazil compared to what you saw in Europe a few years ago?
Scott Morrison: Well, I think that we, having been in the business a long time, are always concerned about the industry getting overbilled. And I don't think we're there yet on what has been announced and so forth, or anywhere close to it. I think the market down there is close to 1.5 billion cans short, at least in terms of the forecast. There are cans being imported into Brazil this year, which is not a good economic outcome. So as we and others invest and/or put in more capacity, it's to fulfill an identified demand. But I think all of us have to be concerned and careful about this whole idea of being overbilled. Our new plant north of REO, both of these lines, the one that's operating and the one that is going to come up, as John said, early next year are sold out. So the other part is, as you know, although from time to time, we ship cans long distances, freight's an issues. So where you're located in a large country in a large market is not important either. I mean, we're not going to do silly things. And hopefully, our competitors won't either, and we'll see. But as of right now, I feel okay about all that. John, do you have anything to add?
John Hayes: No, I think that's well said.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just maybe following up, as you look across your global footprint in beverage cans, are there other markets that fit similar to Brazil, specifically, that are net short cans now that you could look for opportunities to add additional can lines?
John Hayes: Yeah, you know, I talked a little bit about this on our last conference call and the short answer is, yes, we're actively looking at those things, but for competitive purposes, we'd prefer not to disclose those. But there is -- we are seeing a trend in global beverage cans that are quite positive, particularly on the beer side and particularly in some of the other specialty areas. You're seeing package-share shifts going towards cans and we are very in tune with that, and we are very much on it in terms of making sure that we're going to capture opportunities, but not doing it in a way that's not responsible.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: A couple of quick questions for you. One, I don't want to belabor the plastic stuff too much, but is it -- how should I interpret -- obviously, it was a shortfall in 1Q. The last couple of years, you guys have done roughly in the neighborhood of $16 million of EBIT there. Is what happened in 1Q something that we should just look at as a one-time event, it's over, it's done? Or is it as the year progresses, you can – now that you're qualified again in those lines, can you make up for some lost volume or make up for some of the preformed contract that might have taken a little longer or something of that nature?
R. Hoover: Well, I think that what you described is likely what's going to happen for the balance of the year, that is, we should be able to run better. We were hurt by two things, the things that we have already discussed about the qualifications and so on. But also, volume was light in the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, all of our lines are running now, and shipments are picking up. And we just heard a day or two ago that we're having trouble keeping up in a place or two. So no doubt that has a good impact. I would just say that overall, we have to fix this business. We did get price increases and so forth. Volumes have been softer. But it's getting a lot of attention inside of our company right now as to what to do. On the other hand, because as you mentioned earlier, it really isn't very large in terms of the overall Ball Corporation. And so I think one needs to keep that in mind. We want to make it perform better, certainly, and we may have to take actions to cause that to happen. So, John, do you have anything that you can add?
John Hayes: No. You know, volumes have been quite soft over the last couple of years in that business and it makes it very challenging with the various leverage you can pull to improve that business. As Dave mentioned, we have been spending a lot of time looking about how we can play in a way that generates value better than what we're doing today. And we've got to find a different way relative to the status quo. And we have looked at a whole bunch of different things to try and make this a better business.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And that's helpful. And then one thing that you didn't specifically mention was in Asia, I think you have a JV that you were closing on finishing. Can you give us any update there with respect to timing and how that market in particular looked? And along those lines, to follow up on what Rick just asked you, what you're thinking over there with respect to where your capacity's at? Is that a target market that – you know, it seems to be growing pretty rapidly, you could continue some more expansion in it?
Scott Morrison: Well, on the acquisition, we continue to work through their version of the antitrust process, and that can take -- it's a relatively new process over there, so it's taking a little bit of time. But everything continues to move forward. From a capacity standpoint, this plant is right in the sweet spot of where a lot of the growth is in China, and we think we have some opportunities once we get ahold of this plant. So everything continues to be progressing, but a little bit slower than what we'd like it to be.
R. Hoover: And when you take that whole region, the Asian region, pretty writ large, half the population of the world lives there, number one. Number two, it's a much younger population. Number three, it's a population that's moving from the rural areas to the urban areas. And number four, it's probably the strongest GDP growth, and that means per capita growth around the world. So all those secular trends point to it. Some of the regions are much more can-oriented than others. There's been a lot of consolidation of multi-national beer, soft drink and other companies in there, which should be helpful on it. So that's why, not only in China, but in non-China Asia, we think there's opportunities for us.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: That's helpful. And I just have one quick follow-up. It sounds like -- as we look at the balance sheet from a leverage perspective, you guys are going to be back below where you were almost before the deal a year ago as we get to the end of this year. And it sounded like, from earlier comments, dividends would be something you'd be taking a look at again as well. How should we think about other uses of cash as you work the way through the year? I mean, you've been active already in some share repurchase, but there are also some interesting acquisition opportunities remaining out there globally. How do you view your ability to execute right now another acquisition? Do you look at what you've done here in North America as kind of consuming a disproportionate amount of resources? Or do you think that you could execute another deal?
Scott Morrison: Well, I'll talk to this from a financial perspective and let somebody else chime in from a strategic perspective. But financially, we're in excellent shape. The debt offering that we did to replace the 2012 notes pushes our debt maturities out, so we have a nice profile from that perspective. We are – you're right, by the end of this year, our balance sheet's better than when we made the acquisition last year. And so we think we have a lot of the flexibility, that's why we're going to turn up the stock, buy it back for the remainder of this year. And we think we can take advantage of a lot of different opportunities.
R. Hoover: Yeah, I certainly concur with that. As far as our ability to acquire -- in our Board meeting yesterday, Ray Seabrook said the integration of the plants that we bought is done. And so that is not a continuing kind of activity that from the standpoint of trying to get it integrated that we have. And we certainly have the financial capacity and the interest to continue to look at acquisitions that fit our company and we think that can add value. So you know, you can't ever predict when those things happen ahead of time. But rest assured, we're looking in any and all ways to create value here.
John Hayes: You know, the strategy we're currently employing is no different than what we've done over the past 10 years, and that's being on the acquisitions side or investment side, being patient and tenacious at the same time, while in-between the times that we are making acquisitions, we're using our free cash flow to buy back stock, pay dividends and deliver value to our shareholders. So that concept today is no different than what we've done in over the past decade.
R. Hoover: Yeah, as Scott told you earlier, we plan to buy more than the stock we bought in the first quarter.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: I know at the end of the fourth quarter – I guess on the first -- the January call, you indicated CapEx of $235 million for the year. And I think it was after that that you announced the second line in Brazil. Is that going to be within that $235 million number?
Scott Morrison: Yeah, the $235 million -- the Brazil numbers show up in equity and affiliates. So that's – the second line that's down there doesn't show up in our numbers, but it's essentially self-financed.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: So you don't have to contribute more to the partnership?
Scott Morrison: Correct.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: And as we think about CapEx in '11 and '12, obviously, it would be somewhat subject to future acquisitions, if there are any. But barring that, do you think that number will be about at the same level in 2011 or could it move up some?
Scott Morrison: You know, until we see -- we're starting to see some, as John mentioned, some growth opportunities. But until we see stronger growth where we need to put in additional capital, right now, we see it staying roughly at the level that it will be this year.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: And then I think when you look at the Brazilian market, which, as you described, as growing mid-teens in terms of volume, correct me, but it didn't seem like that market ever really saw a year-over-year decline for any period of time. Correct that perception. And then as you look at that demand growth today and perhaps going forward, do you see a mix in the share of cans versus glass, either in CSD or beer or any other category?
R. Hoover: Yeah, to answer your first question, it hasn't been since probably the 2000, 2001 time frame when there was some currency issues down there as well as election changes, in terms of the government, that there was some softness there. But ever since then, it's been moving forward nicely and accelerating as time has gone on. With respect to the market share mix, the beer has been stronger relative to soft drink down there. And beer, it's really glass versus cans. And on the soft drink, you also have PET in the mix as well. So if I recall off the top of my head, the can as a share of beer mix is in the upper 30s, call it 37%, 38%, and on the CSD side, it's probably low teens. And so as that economy continues to mature, as the GDP per cap continues to increase, and as the government continues to invest in infrastructure in anticipation of the '14 World Cup and the '16 Olympics, I think the underpinnings for the continued growth looks nice. Let's not forget that here in North America, in the beer segment, cans as a share of package mix is now probably over 50%.
Chip Dillon - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: Obviously, the opportunity would seem to be more in the CSD area if it's only in the low teens. And I know that you have the whole distribution system built on returnable glass. But we went to cans here when we developed larger supermarkets, et cetera. And I would imagine that trend is -- is that something that you would expect to help you in the CSD area or is it really more about beer?
R. Hoover: It certainly can. It's just, given the competitive dynamics of PET versus cans and the way that market has developed, the can in the CSD segment is certainly behind it. But we would hope through some innovation and other things -- for example, we are doing a lot more in terms of innovative can sizes. We've talked with customers about our receivable end down there. And so I think innovation will be an important part on the CSD side.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Just a question on Metal Food and Household. Could you parse out the volume – I know you said 3% growth. Could you parse out any appreciable difference between the food cans and aerosol cans within that volume growth number?
John Hayes: Yeah, In the first quarter the food cans were a little bit better than the aerosol. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but if it was approximately 3% blended, that would mean probably closer to 4.5% or 5% on the food side and probably 2% or so on – 1% to 2% on the aerosol side. Aerosols, might – the seasonality of each of those is quite different, though. And so as we go into the second quarter of aerosol, we're seeing pickup in that, relative to – as I mentioned earlier, to paint, some of the things that are used in the summertime. And on the food side, we expect those trends to continue throughout the year. Our conversations with our customers indicate that barring weather and crops and other things like that, that they expect it to be a robust year, largely because the destocking we saw, particularly in the first half of last year is over and we're seeing consumers starting to restock in the pantry.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: Last question for me is on Europe. Did currency add, if anything, appreciable in EBIT? I think he had had some currency there, but I wanted to check on that.
Scott Morrison: Well, we actually had a bit of a headwind because we had hedged last year at a much higher rate than what it was, than what we experienced. We actually had about $0.03 headwind in the first quarter.
Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research: And with that, did that headwind flow within that segment? Or is that captured in that other unallocated corporate?
Scott Morrison: It's in that segment.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Andy Feinman from Iridian Asset Management.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Dave, you said something about waiting for -- I think you said something about waiting for bids or offers on some other things you're selling. Could you please repeat that?
R. Hoover: I think that was with respect to the Aerospace business. And we won a sizable contract called our GFO-2 that we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we have bids out for several, in particular, large hardware contracts. That business sorts itself into three parts: The antenna and equipment business, a technical services business. Both of those continue to see growth. And that's about now, about 40% of the total. So the hardware business, we finished a lot of things and it was kind of slowing down. And we've seen no decisions being made. Well, one's been made, we can anticipate, I think during the balance of this year, a few more. And if we win our share of those, we'll see our backlog build and so on. The business, actually, at this point through four months is frankly tracking a little ahead of where I thought it might be. And that's a credit to the people there, and that we have been winning smaller things. But we're optimistic that we're beginning to see inflection there, and more to come.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from George Staphos from Bank of America.
George Staphos: Scott, if we look at the year-on-year change in beverage Americas and Asia EBIT, my earlier question I was trying to get at, perhaps some apportionment to improvement from costs and productivity, Metal Container Corp., the acquisition of the four facilities and/or improvements you made in the market in terms of your turns on pricing, et cetera. Is there any way to break that out?
Scott Morrison: Well, the biggest chunk of the improvement year-over-year would obviously be the Metal Container, that the plants that we acquired last year. I'd say the next biggest chunk would be improvement in Asia, where we're seeing strong volume growth and improved pricing there. Those would be the two biggest pieces. And then a little bit of benefit, as I said, the last quarter of benefit from previous rationalization, moves that we made. And then also, a little bit as John talked about, on the legacy volume. If you can –- it's hard to break out exactly what legacy volume is, but a little bit of an offset from that.
George Staphos: Will those components change much over the rest of the year? I know you talked about the plant rationalization being essentially over. I don't have my notes exactly in front of me, but I do recall plant rationalization were going to benefit your results through middle of this year, so that would suggest 2Q as well?
Scott Morrison: Yeah, there's a little bit that leaks into the second quarter, but essentially the plant rationalizations are done. I think a lot of the benefits – and John probably would comment on this – a lot of the best practice sharing that we're seeing from the acquired plants and as we incorporate that into the existing plants, I think that sharing can benefit as we go forward, and then, obviously, as volume starts to pick up.
R. Hoover: Yeah, you know, on the best practice sharing, recall that when we announced the acquisition, we talked about it will take us two to three years to really get after all that stuff. I think we're ahead of plan. As Dave had mentioned, the physical integration in terms of systems, that's over. And now we have a very significant program and project ongoing to really identify those best practices in every one of our facilities and then deploy them in the facilities. And that just takes a little time to show up. But we feel very, very constructive about all the activities that's going on. And it should help us primarily beginning in 2011 and beyond.
George Staphos: I realize the forum makes it at times difficult to talk about these sorts of things, but in the past, you've said when the question had come up about your renegotiation on contracts that were coming up for 2010 that you were pleased with your progress on pricing. A couple of minutes ago, Scott was enumerating some variances in EBIT, and pricing really didn't come up. So I don't think this is the case, but does that suggest, putting the two together, that you were pleased and you didn't get any pricing? How should we think about that?
Scott Morrison: As you know, George, we really don't like to get into those types of things, but what you just said, I would not agree with.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Tim Burns from Cranial Capital.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: David, I have one for you. With this switch from manned to unmanned aircraft, is that a good thing for Ball Aerospace, given probably the need for, I guess, incremental guidance?
R. Hoover: Well, I think historically, we haven't been a builder of much of the shuttle program. We've got star trackers and tanks and other things, but not huge in the revenue line. I believe a lot of the instruments, weather instruments, instruments for DoD and other things that we build aren't in that segment, so it's certainly not hurtful. We did a big review of what's going on budget-wise and otherwise, and I think it could well promote opportunities on a net basis that would help us.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: I think they're saying that – and I guess I'm talking about the Predator and its sister ships, but nearly 40% of the Air Force's procurement is going to be unmanned. So I was just curious.
R. Hoover: Yeah, and I mean, the antenna and the optics and everything else that we build, we're in that space as well. We also do them for manned airplanes, and we do other kinds of things. But I was thinking more about the hardware side of the business, the outer space part. But in terms of the switch, maybe to more of that, which is actually going on, we're heavily involved in those programs.
John Hayes: Tim, as David said earlier, we continue to see good growth on the antenna and video side of our business there, and that relates directly into what you were just describing.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: And I had one comment for John, which is you can talk all you want about world football, but if the Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA championship, can sales are up 4% or 5%.
John Hayes: I'll look forward to having that discussion with you when they win then.
Operator: Mr. Hoover, there no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
R. Hoover: Okay. Well, and thanks very much, Suzy. I hope the folks on the call can feel the enthusiasm that we have for where we are in the business. It's as healthy as it's been in a while. And I can see not just in this year, but in the next few years, improving performance. And I suspect we're going to have lots of opportunities. So with that, we'll talk to you again in July. Thanks for listening.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Have a great day.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Hoover – Chairman and CEO John Hayes – President and COO Scott Morrison – SVP, CFO & Treasurer Ray Seabrook – EVP & COO, Global Packaging
Analysts: George Staphos – Merrill Lynch Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird Claudia Heuston – JP Morgan Joe Naya – UBS Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation Mark Wilde – Deutsche Bank Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse Alton Stump – Longbow Research Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays Al Kabili – MacQuarie Richard Skidmore – Goldman Sachs Janet Rogers – WFMJ Andy Feinman – Iridian George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 28, 2010. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Hoover: Thank you, Shawn and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual result or out comes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. And if you don't have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Ball finished 2009 on a strong note. Fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.84 versus $0.56 last year increased by 50%. Also on a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share were $4.05 in 2009 versus $3.61 in 2008. A 12% improvement. Our businesses are performing well. Nearly every segment saw month on month volume improvement during 2009. We're executing on our strategy to grow our global beverage can business and our strong free cash flow long-term relationships with customers and sound balance sheet position us to build on our momentum in 2010 and beyond. 2010 marks Ball's 130th year in business and we're going to work hard to make sure it's our best year ever. With me, on today's call are John Hayes, President and Chief Operating Officer and Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And also joining us is Ray Seabrook. In November, we announced that John, Scott and Ray were being promoted. While Ray's been our CFO for a decade, he's always had an infinity for our operations. And now as his new role as Executive Vice President Global Packaging, he has operating responsibility for 90% of Ball's businesses. While today and in the future Scott will interpret our numbers, we thought the investor community should not be cut off cold turkey from Ray. So we invited Ray to be on the call today. And before Scott and John discuss the quarter, Ray would you like to greet the group?
Ray Seabrook: Absolutely. A decade sounds like a long time. I'm excited about my new position with the company and getting more involved with the day-to-day operations. John, Scott and I have worked closely with over the last ten years and from my prospective, the transition to our new jobs has gone smoothly. Scott, Dave and I the past two CFOs of the company turn over the conference call reigns to you. And I might add, we turn it over to you with record 2009 results and a plan for at least a $0.5 billion dollars of free cash flow for 2010. So with that, take it away Scott.
Scott Morrison: Thanks, Ray. With that kind of lead in what can I say other than I have big shoes to fill, but I'm confident our finance team is up to the challenge. Ray has been a great example of what a CFO should be. And I'm excited about the opportunity to follow him and get to know all of out the call better. In the fourth quarter, Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were up $0.84, well ahead of last year's $0.56. Overall the fourth quarter numbers were very strong due to excellence performance in metal beverage packaging in America and Asia. A better than expected contribution from the newly acquired metal container plant. A stronger Euro and excellent fixed cost controls in European beverage and an overall lower effective tax rate. Turning to the operating segments, metal beverage Americas and Asia had improved earnings for the quarter and the year. A better than expected contribution from the metal container plant, cost savings resulting from prior plant rationalization and lower fixed costs, all provided good earnings momentum in the quarter. Metal beverage Europe's' earnings were up considerably for the quarter, due to the impact of a higher Euro and lower fixed costs. Full year lower earnings were primarily related to the full year exchange impact and product mix. Metal food and household product earnings in the quarter were down due to lower volume. And the favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, earnings were up considerably due to inventory holding gains, improved margins and benefits from prior plant rationalization efforts, which more than offset the double digit volume declines in the segment. Plastics was profitable in the fourth quarter versus breakeven results last year. Full year EBIT improved slightly despite an 11% reduction in volume. Aerospace and technologies posted near double digit EBIT margins in the quarter despite lower sales. The absence of large, fixed price hardware contract was the primary reason for the decline in year-over-year revenue and earnings. A higher Euro in the quarter, compared to last year increased diluted share earnings by $0.04 and for the year the impact of a lower Euro was a negative impact of a diluted $0.03 per share compared to 2008. Turning to full year free cash flow, Ball generated $373 million which was on target with our expectations. That included an incremental $14 million pension contribution and an investment in working capital totaling $82 million, which was slightly larger than our earlier estimate of $70 million as we took advantage of early payment discounts. The working capital build is expected to largely reverse in 2010. As Ray indicated would to be with the case, the cash collateral the company was required to post with counter parties in 2008 was returned by the end of 2009. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $2.4 billion, only $100 million higher than the net balance sheet debt at the end of 2008, despite making a nearly $600 million acquisition during 2009. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with the 2009 rolling four quarters EBIT to interest coverage of 5.6 times and net debt to EBITDA at 2.5 times. Committed credit and available liquidity at year-end was in excess of $800 million. As we look to full year 2010 earnings and cash flow, we anticipate capital spending in the range of $235 million. CapEx will remain at these disciplined levels until we see growth opportunities returning. Free cash flow should be in excess of $.5 billion, excluding the impact of a change in how we account for our AR securitization program, which I will cover in a minute. Pension expense is projected to be about $6 million higher in 2010 while after tax pension funding is expected to be approximately $25 million lower. The full year effective tax rate will likely increase to around 33% due to projected higher U.S. earnings as a result of the full year impact of our metal beverage acquisition as the U.S. is our highest tax jurisdiction. With the full year impact of the additional debt for our acquisition, we expect 2010 interest expense in the range of $140 million. We also expect to improve our already strong balance sheet in 2010 while having plenty of flexibilities to create values for our shareholders. Also, I want to get ahead of the curve and address an item before we get to our first quarter earnings announcement. Due to the issuance of revised guidance on the accounting for AR securitization programs, effective in the first quarter of 2010, the aspects of how free cash flow will look in 2010 needs to be addressed. The accounting change will result in our securitization being placed on the balance sheet. We've had a securitization since the 1990s and have consistently reported the outstanding amounts during conference call and financial statement foot notes. Ball's 2009 year end AR securitization balance was $250 million, the maximum level of the plan. The change will be reflect in the first quarter 10-Q and subsequent period for any outstanding securitization balance. And in the first year the effect will be to increase accounts receivable and debt on the balance sheet. While the net balance sheet and cash flow effect is zero, the change will create a one-time reduction in operating cash flow for the amount of receivable securitize and in offsetting increase in cash inflows from financing activities. We will break out the impact so you will be able to see the net change and comparability between periods. It's purely an accounting change but wanted to point it out now so you'll be aware of the change. And it with that I'll turn it over to John.
John Hayes: Thank you, Scott. As Ray mentioned, all of us have been working together for a number of years. And like every good team. We're able to feed off each other. We have complementary skill sets a talented bench of people across the organization and a wonderful base from which to continue building. Needless to say all of us are geared to go here at Ball Corporation. We did have a strong year in 2009 and we are keyed up for a better 2010 and beyond. Better supply demand balance, good focus on cost management, a disciplined approach to our commercial activities and continued focus on market leadership and sustainability and innovation helped drive our 2009 performance. Now turning to the various businesses, profitability for the quarter in our metal beverage packaging Americas and Asia segment was slightly above our expectations and notably improved over 2008. This was driven largely by improving volume dynamics late in the fourth quarter. Cost containment in this business remains excellent and continued cost savings from plant rationalization contributed to improved results. Excluding the newly acquired facility, our fourth quarter volume in North America was down approximately 3% versus a decline of 1% for the industry. However, our volumes improved month by month in the quarter and our December results were some of the strongest that we've seen in a while. Driving this was stronger promotional activity for our customers on the CSD side as they balance the value to volume equation and continued pact and share increases on the beer side of the business. Volumes in our newly-acquired facilities also experienced similar demand trends. At year-end, Ball also successful concluded negotiations on all of our significant metal beverage contracts. Our customer conversations were constructive and we are satisfied with the results of these negotiations. With the acquisition of the former metal container plants in North America, we had the opportunity to take a fresh look at our customer mix and we used this opportunity to balance our customer concentration. Given the size of our business, this often can take a couple of years to accomplish and as a result, we may step back slightly in 2010 in terms of overall volume while recovering it in 2011 and beyond. In Asia, Ball announced in November its intention to acquire the remaining 65% interest in JFP San Choi facility. Once completed this facility will provide Ball an opportunity to better serve our customer base in southern China and provide a low-cost way of increasing our capacity without growing overall industry capacity. In summary, we expect 2010 profitability in the Americas-Asia segment to be improved driven by the contribution of three additional quarters of the two acquisitions, continued cost savings resulting from the previously announced capacity closures, continued focus on our cost optimization initiatives and continued growth from new innovative product launches like Alumi-Tek and the 7.5 ounce 90 calorie soft drink can. This will be slightly offset by planned lower volumes in North America. In our European operations, volumes improved slightly with volumes roughly flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. A stronger Euro and cost saving initiatives implemented in the plants offset continued negative product mix with 0.33 CSD growth offsetting lower $0.50-cent liter beer sales. We have seen Eastern Europe excluding Russia stabilization and Western Europe holds up well particularly in France and the Netherlands. As we look towards 2010. The overall pricing dynamics in Europe are a bit more challenging than in prior years due to the supply/demand balance. However, our European management team continues to monitor the demand trends by region and stands ready to adjust to any deviations to our expectations. A continued FX tail wind and mitigating cost inputs will help to offset weaker price mix. As in the Americas and Asia segment, we expect earnings improvement in 2010 and this segment as well. Our food and household product group performed very well in 2009. Excellent execution on a rationalization program, tight discipline around our pricing and cost recovery initiatives and overall attention to detail and focused execution contributed to strong performance. Fourth quarter year-over-year performance was off mainly due to a favorable resolution of a $6.8 million claim collected in fourth quarter of 2008 and difficult volume comps from a prior year. Recall, fourth quarter 2008 volumes were up 4% due to a pre buy of food and aerosol packaging that impacted the entire industry. Aerosol volumes continued to improve at year-end but still finished the year down more than 10%. As Scott mentioned, first quarter 2010 comparisons in the segment will be negative as a result of the first quarter 2009 inventory holding gains. Plastic packaging Americas had a challenging fourth quarter driven primarily by lower volumes in the CSD and water segments. Overall volumes were down in the low teens and we took additional downtime in the fourth quarter to manage inventory targets. However, our food plastic customer base experienced improved trends, especially in the small category of nutraceuticals. Our aerospace business had a strong fourth quarter with sales in EBIT both exceeding our internal expectations. Our Antana components and service businesses are maintaining good growth protectory. And management is awaiting word on a number of bids to enhance the backlog and position the business for growth going forward. We're pleased with the operational perform of our Company but we're not content. 2010 will be a year where we continue to make further progress on the initiatives underway while focusing on best practice sharing and plant efficiencies across our worldwide system and the continued execution of our overall strategy. And with that, I'll turn it back to Dave.
Dave Hoover: Thanks, John and thank you, Scott and you Ray for your comments. Ball Corporation's performing very well. Our strategy is clear, the balance sheet is strong and our strong free cash flow provides flexibility to generate value creation for our shareholders. I'm optimistic about 2010 in the longer term prospects for our business. The company certainly expects full year 2010 results to improve over those of last year. And with that, Shawn, I believe we're ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions. It's encouraging to see that you've seen a bit of a pickup in your beverage Americas volumes. Dave or John or Ray, if you could comment at all, how the tone of dialog has changed perhaps with your customers regarding promotion into the new year. What sorts of trends they expect and how that varies with what you were seeing last year at this time? And then similarity in food cans can you comment on, it's early in the year particularly for food cans but what the tone of dialog is with your customers about their expectations for volumes and promotion? And had one or two follows, quick ones. Thanks.
John Hayes: This is John. I'll try to cover both of those. On the CSD side if you go back 12 months Good evening, ago, the overall CSD segment was really focusing on pricing over volume. And you could clearly see it in all of the IRI numbers. As you got to the fourth quarter of last year you started to see those trends reverse and you saw a lot of promotional activity. And they were really focusing on trying to get the volume going through price promotions. And again if you look at the IRI data over the last four weeks or eight weeks of the quarter you're clearly able to see that. As you go into 2010, I think the customer base is still trying to figure out this value versus volume equation and while we don't have very strong expectations that they are going to push real hard, it's too early in the year to tell. We do have the Winter Olympics coming up. We have the World Cup over in Europe. I think some of the promotional activity around that will be telling. Turning to the food side, I think the tone overall is relatively constructive. There was a destocking in first half of the year last year and that's why we believe volumes were a bit soft. They started to improve in the fourth quarter and as we go into 2010 we're starting to see some volume trends that are much more constructive than they certainly were 12 months ago.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. The two follow-ons. One, within your key products, beverage cans or food cans, are you seeing any increased level of threat from substitution? And if there is, how would it vary by geography? And then on the pricing and supply dynamic in Europe, can you give us an update in terms of how that trend has evolved? And what sort of operating rate do you think you might be at. I realize it's hard to say in January in 2010 in Europe? Thanks very much.
John Hayes: On the substitution issue, you go around the world actually the beverage can is doing reasonably well. I mentioned in North America on the beer side it's been gaining share on the package mix. I think in 2010, when the financial crisis hit in late 2008 you did see in Eastern Europe for example, a decline of the can on a relative basis to overall beer volumes. We're starting to see a little bit of recovery. In fact I believe in the fourth quarter, generally speaking, as I said Eastern Europe you exclude Russia and there was actually a little bit of growth in some of those major market there's. So, I think overall the can is holing up pretty well in this overall environment. And we have expectations that these trends will continue because of the convenience of the can and the wonderful sustainability aspects of it. With respect to your question about efficiencies and supply/demand in Europe, we're running pretty tight. As you recall we had plans to get going on our Lublin holding facility and we've put those on a definite hold because we don't need to be making cans for practice. We expect to be pretty tight in 2010 from an efficiency point of view. But there's been other capacity additions in the industry and I think that's what I was alluding to.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird: Hey guys. Good morning. The courtesy benefit for European business was that purely translation or was there transaction benefit as well.
John Hayes: Transaction benefit?
Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird: Yes. Was it just purely translation?
John Hayes: Translation, that's just improved performance, lower fixed costs.
Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird: All right. And did you see any reason to take on, was there any extra down time taken across your regions sort of around the quarter for cash, more so than normal?
Dave Hoover: There was some curtailment in North America.
John Hayes: All of our businesses in North America, we took down time that was greater than we have in past years because as we've said we're going to be running the business for cash. And we don't need to throw a bunch of excess inventory on our balance sheets.
Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird: Right. And just, John, on the promotional activity, was that very specific to cans or did you see any sort of spillover, like maybe in the quarter on the plastic business as well? Thanks.
John Hayes: No. I think generally speaking it was across the segment and it wasn't specific to a particular package.
Ghansham Panjabi – Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Claudia Heuston with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Claudia Heuston – JP Morgan: Thanks very much. Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Claudia Heuston – JP Morgan: You commented that metal container was better than expected in terms of its contribution in the quarter. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that and talk about where the upside was versus your expectations. And if you've got any comments, how that integration is progressing?
Scott Morrison: This is Scott. It improved in each of the months and if you look at it on a net from add the debt we had for finance it was modestly accretive in the quarter. And I think the integration is going fantastic, both ways. John may want to add more to that.
John Hayes: We have a lot of activities to share best practices across the facilities. They're wonderful facilities as are ours and we can be learning from each other. And so we have very detailed plans on how to make sure we're maximizing the most out of both systems.
Claudia Heuston – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then you had commented on the fixed costs in Europe being quite good and they certainly were better than we had expected. Was there anything specific that drove the good cost performance there?
John Hayes: Simply put, it was our management team getting all over controlling those things that they have the ability to control.
Claudia Heuston – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Naya with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Naya – UBS: Good morning. There have been a couple of companies out there that mention they'd saw some customers may be push some volume back from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. I was wondering if you saw anything like that? If you saw customers deferring volume to manage cash?
Scott Morrison: I don't think so. I don't know, guys. I certainly haven't heard that.
John Hayes: No. We've not heard more seen them.
Joe Naya – UBS: Okay. And I'm just curious, kind of broadly speaking, what's the tone of your customers like. Do they seem to be expecting some improvement here in the near term or what's the outlook from their prospective?
Dave Hoover: Well, the people I've been around or talked with, I'm thinking in food cans, some in the beer and beverage business, I think it can vary customer to customer but generally more optimistic. We're all looking for green shoots or whatever it is for the economy but if you think about our business it doesn't fluctuate as many do. And the best side we have is how we performed in the fourth quarter, I think. We're a reflection of what our customers are doing, but certainly, John mentioned earlier, for example, the destocking in food. People lived out of their pantries for a period of time. And one of our good food customers told me that they're absolutely certain that's what happened. You might have seen, I think it was in yesterday's "Wall Street Journal" he talked about the bull whip effect. And they were mentioning I think Caterpillar specifically who's ordering a lot for from their customers and so on and so forth because they've run their inventories down so far. Even if they don't expect sales improvements, they've got to start building and the lead times and so forth. If that does begin to happen, that ought to improve economic activity and it ought to improve the sales of our customers.
John Hayes: I may add if you go outside of the United States, in fourth quarter in Europe our volumes actually were up in the quarter if you exclude the export sales. Our export sales were down a little bit having to do with various issues but our fourth quarter in what we would describe Western and Eastern Europe excluding Russia, they were up. You go down into Brazil where we're seeing strong growth down there. And you go into China and you see beverage growth still in the strong in double digits. So, if there was destocking I think we're starting to get some of it back.
Joe Naya – UBS: And just out of curiosity, now that you've had a little bit of time with the assets woven into the mix, do you have any update in terms of synergy expectations from the plants you are hired?
Dave Hoover: I don't think that we do. I think certainly we feel that we ought to be able to achieve over the time of the amounts that we indicated. Hopefully it will be better. Pretty fast though it gets hard to really track that. We are going to operate as one system and as John said earlier though, I think we are optimistic that there's may be more to do than we estimated.
Joe Naya – UBS: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation: Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on a terrific way to finish up the year.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Scott Morrison: Thanks.
Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation: A couple of questions for you. First of all, let's start in Europe. Since we're kind of talking around that area, as you look into 2010, you're starting to see some improved volume trajectory sounds like out of your core Europe, Eastern, Western. Do you think it's reasonables we look out into the next 12 months, to anticipate kind of mid single digit volume growth over there again?
Scott Morrison: To be quite honest, Chris, it's too early to tell. We do have tail wind in terms of the destocking we mentioned that was a global issue as well as the World Cup which is generally in the same time zone as Europe and that's a big deal over there. But to be honest, I just think it's too early to say what the volume expectations are. We can tell you to CSD has been performing better than beer. But I think with the World Cup as I said they're going to see a lot of beer promotional activity all through Western and Eastern Europe.
Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation: So as I look at maybe this gets more detail than you would like. When I look at operating performance over there at EBIT dollars, you were off a little bit this year. And I think most of that throughout the year was probably currency related. But even in an environment you sounds you did very well and got some costs out of the system at the end of the year. Would there be any reason to expect that you wouldn't continued to see some growth at least in the profit side Europe next year?
John Hayes: As we sit here today that's what our expectations are. What we've been trying to do only in Europe but across our businesses as you all know we're a fixed cost business. And We get a lot of operating leverage as volumes start to return. So, We've been trying to position ourselves for the worst. And if volume expectations come back, we've got a lot of leverage there.
Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation: Okay. So last question I had was, use of the cash in 2010, with your credit stats back to essentially predeal, you still have nine months of that to roll through your numbers yet and it will look even better. How would you prioritize use of the free cash? Do you think about dividends do you think about more share repurchase? Are there areas out to acquire that look attractive to you? How do you think about that balance, John?
Scott Morrison: I think we look at – this is Scott – I think we look at all of those things. The focus is on generating free cash flow. We think this year it's in excess of half a billion dollars. We have $250 million of term loan payments to make this year. So that leaves quite a bit of extra and we look at share repurchase and dividends and we look at acquisitions. So whatever the opportunity that present itself.
Chris Manuel – Ball Corporation: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Wilde – Deutsche Bank: Good morning. I wonder if there's any way to help us get a little clearer on what that volume adjustment in North America and Bev can may look like in 2010, assuming that sort of overall industry volumes are flattish?
Scott Morrison: Yes. It will be down a little bit. It's too early to tell. You said assuming volumes have flattish. It's going to be down a little bit. But not wholesale. So don't read into that. It's just that we said, there's a balancing effect going on. You have to do it over multi years. We'll take a slight step back in 2010 and make it up in 2011. So Well, yes
Mark Wilde – Deutsche Bank: All right. And then if I could, the plastics business. Just any more thoughts kind of further initiatives you could take there beyond the closures that you've announced? Improve the performance in that business?
John Hayes: Well, we're, it's been a challenging time when volumes are off. I give our folks a lot of credit with volumes off as much as they were and have flat earning year-over-year. It's gotten to the point where it really depends on what is going on in the market place. And on some of the specialty stuff we've seen some good growth not only in the nutraceuticals but just generally on the heat set. We do some wine business and other things like. We've had good growth and profitable growth to profit the cold side of the business. But we're spending a lot of time looking at how we can play that in a way that we can make money.
Scott Morrison: Meanwhile, in reducing the investment in the businesses as you've pointed out and I think we're about $350 million down to $100 million or $150 million from the peak.
Mark Wilde – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And the last question I had. The bouts that we have seen in Asia in the second half of the year is really kind of underscored the potential in that region over time. I would like to get your thoughts about sort of expansion plans in the region. How you would grow, whether it's to go in with existing partners or whether green field things and how important that to you over the next five to 10 years?
Dave Hoover: Well, I think you're right. Is one of the areas where we see lots of people and not many cans. We've been in China for a long time and we're doing very well there now. We stepped up and bought our, buying our partner out there in one of the plants as we've talked about earlier. John, you might comment. We are at the present time formulating a strategy for Asia. And it could include those things that you mentioned. Working with existing partners on our own, I think if you can find existing assets, particularly in new markets that are operating and you feel that that's a good way to enter that. That might be the best way. Why don't you comment too, John?
John Hayes: We've been spending a lot of time in that region for competitive and other purposes. I wouldn't go into great detail but we do see a lot of opportunity. Our strategy today has really been focused on China. And we're looking at now non-China/Asia. And as Dave mentioned when we've had a lot of success it's typically not by building it and it will come. It's working with customers, it's potentially acquiring other parties and doing some things like had on a small scale. Those are the types of things we're focusing on as priority number one.
Mark Wilde – Deutsche Bank: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Yes. Good morning. When you all bought metal container, I think Ray had mentioned, you saw the first year at free cash flow at $50 million. Sounds like you might be a little bit ahead of that. And I know it may be tough to measure as you're putting things together. Would a $55 million or $60 million kind of number be more realistic given what you've experienced so far?
John Hayes: No. We think we're on track with our original projections.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Even though you said earlier that you thought you were doing better than expected with that?
John Hayes: Earnings start showing up quicker than what we initially anticipated but I think we're on track for where we had hoped we would be. And the full year run rate looks to be where we thought it would be when we acquired the business.
Scott Morrison: The only thing I'll add into that is as part of the $50 million in cash flow we had certain expectations for capital expenditures. As we've gotten into these plant and realize how terrific they were from an overall upkeep prospective, we may have a little bit of upside on the CapEx but again it's not wholesale.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Got you. And thinking your flexibility or what you chose to do with your free cash. Obviously, you took on a little bit more with the Chinese investment later in the year. And I guess looking with an eye on the ratings agencies. Does that mean it's likely you'll go beyond the 250 in payments you owe this year and try to pay off a little more debt and therefore wait until next year before you would look to do something like a buyback or should we not read that into your situation?
John Hayes: No. I think we'll have the 250 in payments and we have a lot of flexibility with the other cash we're going to generate. I don't think, by the end of 2010 our credit stats will be better than they are right now. And I think we have plenty of flexibility to start repurchasing shares and dividends and the normal things that we do with the cash.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: During 2010?
John Hayes: Right.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Got you. And then lastly, when you look at the food can business and on obviously last year was a great year because of some of the inventory situations, but as you look at beyond that and you look at industry pricing and volumes, what, I guess we can't count on a pack like we had in 2009 but does the pricing dynamic seem to be similar when you ex out the inventory gain and the margin dynamics? Do you see any deterioration or improvement in 2010 versus 2009?
John Hayes: Stripping that out we don't see a lot of deviation in terms of price cost. Think about 12 months ago and what we were going through in interprets of having to push through these extraordinary costs. The costs have abated and so it's a much more, I'll call it normalized situation. But we don't see any significant issues up or down.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Got you.
Dave Hoover: We're doing our best to hold the line with our suppliers and to not be in that position that we've been in the last couple years as far as our pricing actions.
Chip Dillon – Credit Suisse: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Just looking at Eastern European Bev can market you mentioned that you saw overall demand conditions stabilize in the fourth quarter. Is there any signs of an actual recovery there yet or are we still a quarter or two away from that?
Dave Hoover: I think it's pretty torrent to talk about significant recovery. We have indefinitely put on hold our Lublin plant because a couple of percent increase doesn't really create the need to start up a new plant. And until we see meaningful, sustainable recovery, you should expect that's what we'll do.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Okay. Good. That's all I had, thanks, guys.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier are Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays: Thanks, good morning. And congratulations on a strong, strong quarter.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays: I was surprised by your aerospace revenues and I was curious if you could elaborate on the backlog you're seeing, you mentioned the antenna business. How big is your backlog and what kind of visibilities might you have for 2010?
Dave Hoover: Let me answer that qualitatively. 12 months ago or 14 months ago as we with going into 2009, we knew it would be very difficult and part of the reason why is a number of bids we had outstanding was literally in one of, in hardware side of our business, literally in the tens of millions of dollars. As we sit here right now it's approaching $1 billion. So as a result, the tone and (inaudible) is much good. Now, we haven't won any of that. And that's why we've said, if we have a lot of bids outstanding. We expect to win during the course of 2010, that should set us up nicely for growth as we go into the back half of 2010 and 2011, even if, on a probabilistic basis we win our normal share.
Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays: Okay. That's helpful. Want to clarify in the metal beverage Europe I thought the results were quite strong. You mention fixed cost removal. What was the fixed cost removal you were able to achieve and how much more might you have on the docket?
Dave Hoover: As we were going through down time, we were just putting a particular emphasis on where we were spending our money in the plants. The plants did a very good job, as we all know the trends of volumes got better over time and when you get better over time you even get better efficiencies through the plant. And I think that's what we saw. Recall the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter 2008 was quite a challenging one. That's when the economic crisis hit. And we had a lot of extra down time as a result of that. So I think it's as much as a comparable basis year-over-year than anything else.
Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe lastly for Scott, I was curious if maybe Scott you could remind us on as we think about debt translation effects for currency, can you remind us the composition of debt you have roughly by FX exposure?
Scott Morrison: Yes. The impact year-over-year from a currency translation impact was not significant. In terms of the total debt, we've got $320 million of it is in Euros. Canada $78 million and the rest is in the U.S.
Peter Ruschmeier – Barclays: Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys.
Dave Hoover: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with MacQuarie. Please proceed with your question.
Al Kabili – MacQuarie: Thanks. Wanted to hear if you could give us an update on the progress of the new Brazil account line. How that startup is going and when you see a full contribution?
Dave Hoover: We actually – some of us traveled to Brazil early in December and had a chance to go see the plant. It's north of Rio in Tres Rio's vicinity and it's an excellent facility. It's large, it could accommodate three lines when it's fully utilized. But right now the new line that was installed had the best startup that we've ever had in any can plant. And the date after we were there they made 2 million cans and they made money, in the first, second month, I guess of operation. So it's just doing very, very well. Sold out and customers just up the road. Good situation. John, you were there and Ray too.
Scott Morrison: From an earnings contribution, as we all know David mentioned it has been built for three lines and when you get the operating leverage is when the second line goes in. So I think, yes we are in the black which is good news. But I think of the trajectory of the earnings as we sell that line out and begin to think about additional capacity I think that's where the leverage really comes in.
Al Kabili – MacQuarie: Okay. And just given the current growth rate of the market, can you give us any kind of flavor prediction when you might be able to get that second line. Second line going there?
Dave Hoover: We're looking actively because we believe with the growth of the market as we sit here right now market will be very tight in terms of cans. Soon.
Al Kabili – MacQuarie: Okay. All right. Okay. Good and then lastly if you could just give us an update on the acquisition of Chinese JV that you were looking at in terms of any updates in terms of timing or what you're hearing?
Dave Hoover: We're going through the process. The anti-trust process and we're hopeful we can close sometime early in the second quarter.
Al Kabili – MacQuarie: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Skidmore – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up, John on your comments regarding the renegotiation of contracts in North America. In the past there was I think Ray had mentioned something about making 12 ounce cans fun again at some point. Can you just talk to what you've seen with regards to pricing in the North American Bev can market?
John Hayes: I would prefer not to go into any detail because these if nothing else we're bound by confidentiality. But as I reiterated in my prepared remarks, we were, the conversations were constructive and we were able to have good discussions with our customers and we're satisfied with the result.
Richard Skidmore – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Shifting then just to your commentary about North American volume. Will there be any foot print rationalization that comes out of the down volume in 2010?
John Hayes: No, long-term. As you know we've gone through the last couple of years of taking a real hard look at our capacity foot print. We've taken a fair number out unfortunately but it was the right thing to do long term for the business. As we sit here today we have no expectations for doing anything else in the near term.
Richard Skidmore – Goldman Sachs: Just one last question, the Kent plant closure that you did last year, I know that you had mentioned shipping some volumes. Is that contract done and you're not longer shipping the volumes to the northwest from California, I believe and such that you'll see the benefits of those cost savings coming through in 2010?
John Hayes: That's correct.
Richard Skidmore – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
John Hayes: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Janet Rogers with WFMJ. Please proceed with your question.
Janet Rogers – WFMJ: From what I understand the Hubbard plant or facility in Hubbard, Ohio is calling back some workers. I was trying to find out what your bottom line in order open marines for job retention in the U.S., Ohio or Mahoney valley?
John Hayes: Well, I think what you may be referring to is a temporary phenomenon. We have a very seasonal business in our Hubbard plant, experience. We've been doing some things that actually will hopefully make Hubbard a better facility as we go forward on that but other than that there's no other specific comments.
Janet Rogers – WFMJ: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the upgrades or things you're doing to make the plant better?
John Hayes: Well, we're looking at having some additional business in there. And relooking about where we do business and we have some opportunities that we're pursuing. And if they happen and that would be helpful.
Janet Rogers – WFMJ: Okay. And who am I speaking with? Can I get your name and title.
John Hayes: My name is John Hayes.
Janet Rogers – WFMJ: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Feinman with Iridian.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: Can you tell me how much the pension expense was and the pension funding this year. Last year it was $80 million and $73 million.
Scott Morrison: Last, the expense last year was about $74 million. This year it will be about $79 million. On the funding side, as I made my comments earlier, we prefunded some payments or made some additional payments in 2009. So our total worldwide pension funding was just under $120 million and it will drop in 2010 to under $80 million.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: Okay. And thanks for that. And the more than $500 million of free cash flow that you're expecting in 2010, does that include the reversal of the working capital what was that $80 million?
Scott Morrison: Most of that largely reverses back. That's correct.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: So that's in the $500 million number?
Scott Morrison: That's in the $500 million number.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: And there's a IPO right now for grand packaging going on. And so I guess that's going to change the landscape a little bit in the plastics business. And so are there any ramifications of that for Ball Corp that you can think of?
John Hayes: No. We're not a shareholder.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: Okay. Well, I guess the question is whether that might help you to in some way give you an opportunity to favorably resolve the question of your plastics business. I mean whether it might change the landscape in a way that will help you guys.
John Hayes: Well, I would like to think that anything that happens in the world helps us, but possibly I suppose, Andy.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: All right. And that's it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi guys. Dave, John, I just want to come back to Europe. It sounds like in answering Chris' question you expected European EBIT to be up in 2010 due to costs and currency. I just wanted to confirm that. And to the point of may be some price compression or margin compression I wanted to extend possible in this forum dig into that. Obviously, you have contracts with some form of passer. You said you were relatively tight in terms of supply/demand. I was wondering why it could be you would see compression in 2010 and I had some follow-ons.
John Hayes: This is John. Maybe I'll take a first step. First your question, do we expect the year-over-year earnings improvement in Europe? Yes, we do. Two in terms of price-cost compression. It's a very competitive world out there and as we were going in 2010 we didn't have much business up for renewal but we did have some business. And when you have a supply/demand situation that's a little bit more challenging than in the past. Economics 101 holds true. But we wanted to be very close to our customers. And we're certainly not in the business of gaining share at all, but we haven't been putting capacity in so we just are keeping our capacity running. But we did experience a little bit more pricing issues I think as a result of this supply/demand issue.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks for that, John. Second question, if you do hit the $500 million or greater for free cash flow in 2010 obviously a great achievement for the company in terms of history. As you think about the future and putting growth aside, what areas might you need to reinvest in 2011 and 2012. How sustainable do you think a free cash flow level in the $400 million to $500 million level is the first portion of this decade?
John Hayes: I think the cash flow stays and until we see growth, I mentioned that CapEx would stay at fairly controlled levels until we see growth returning. So I would see our free cash flow would be pretty strong out the next few years absent growth opportunities.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. So there's nothing else whether it's systems or what have you that would require additional investment. Just purely matching demand with your own ability to supply it.
John Hayes: I can we're in pretty good shape from an infrastructure standpoint that we don't see any large programs out there that we can do.
Dave Hoover: George if you go back a couple of years we closed and/or moved things in North America eight different facilities. And we're in the midst of capturing about $88 million of cost savings as a result but as John mentioned earlier, we've got that foot print in pretty good shape for the foreseeable future. Some of the adjustments that we made the new lines in Europe and so forth we put the clutch in on that for now. And frankly two the markets that are growing well are Brazil and China. Brazil because it's currently 50% owned. Doesn't show up in our numbers except as a line. Equity and earnings but there is investment going on there, but –
Scott Morrison: It's also financing.
Dave Hoover: It's also financing. I think just to echo what Scott said, particularly with the metal container plants now and the $50 million or $50 plus million of extra cash and operating at a different level we should have this be sustainable.
George Staphos – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Dave, I appreciate that. The last question I had. Assuming normal weather, whatever that might be. Obviously, you can't control that. What is, in your view, the one thing you need to get right in 2010 for it to be the year that you expect it to be at this juncture. Thanks, guys, good luck in the quarter?
Dave Hoover: The one thing, Gee, I don't know. I think we've got to continue to execute as we are. I don't feel that there's much threatening us. I would say a better economy and the return of some volume. We're really leveraged in our business. And so if we begin to see and can't sustain itself here, Europe, that would be upside but we're pretty focused. Feel like we've got the business in hand. Not a lot of discussions about contracts may be up or this or that. We're pretty much loaded and ready to roll.
John Hayes: I do think the biggest risk if you want to think about that as complacency. With Ray in his role and ours in our new role, I don't think you should expect any complacency.
Dave Hoover: We got the whip out.
Operator: A follow-up question from Andrew Feinman. Please proceed with your question.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: I don't know if Ray is going to be on these calls. Sounds like the beginning the way you introduced him the he won't be. I wanted to let them know that I have high expectations of him in his new role. And I think that we'll all be surprised at how much value you create. I mean that. I actually mean that.
Ray Seabrook: Yes. These things – I expect these operations to perform real well.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: I'm chomping at the bit to see what you're going to do, Ray. And I also just want to mention one thing to Scott. I think that Ray always told us in this call annually how much stock he thought he might be buying back during the year, didn't he? Didn't he used to always give us that this time of year?
Ray Seabrook: He has the capacity to do a lot. And I don't want to get Scott underwater right off the bat, but I would expect, based on operating as we think we will, that we will be in the market. That it will be a sizeable amount. I think that's right.
Scott Morrison: We haven't finalized the plans yet but I would expect to be buying back some shares this year.
Andy Feinman – Iridian: Great. Thank you very much, guys.
Ray Seabrook: You bet, thank you, Andy.
Operator: Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to you. Please continue your presentation or closing remarks.
Dave Hoover: Great. Thank you, Shawn and thank you, everybody, for being on the call. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in April and we'll be seeing you on the road from time to time. So thanks for your attention and let's all get back to work.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference

Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward we will conduct a question and answer session. (operator instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Thursday October 29th 2009. A rebroadcast of today's conference will be available beginning today at 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time till November 5th. To access the rebroadcast please dial 800-633-8284 and enter reservation number 214-387-27. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, CEO. Please go ahead.
R. David Hoover: Thank you Sarah. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's strong third quarter 2009 results. And with me today on the call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and John Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before I begin I would like to remind everyone that the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that maybe expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's SEC filings as well as in company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. While our improved results in the quarter which Ray is going to talk about here in a moment were driven largely by the impact of cost rationalization activities we took during the last year, 18 months. Our focus on cost management during the economic downturn is also paying off. Our plants are running exceptionally well and we continue to focus on ways to reduce cost to be more efficient. Earlier this month, we successfully completed the acquisition of four metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The integration of those facilities is well under way and we are finding the new plants to be as good or better than we saw during due diligence. Their addition to our worldwide beverage can business will provide meaningful for benefits to our entire system. Now I'll talk about our outlook in a few minutes. But next Ray will review the quarter from the financial perspective and than John will discuss our operating performance. Ray.
Raymond J. Seabrook: Thanks Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.24 and to the first nine months were at $3.21, up 10% the quarter and up to the first nine months compared to last year. Turning to the operation, third quarter year-over-year sales volume remain soft in the North America, and beverage can sales are relatively flat in China and Europe. A lower euro exchange rate and decreased aluminum prices also contributed to lower sales dollars in the quarter and year-to-date compared to a year ago. Despite lower third quarter sales and higher operating costs, higher corporate costs, comparable operating earnings and margins were up in the quarter due to improved earnings in our North American metal businesses in China. Third quarter North American metal packaging profitability was improved by lower fixed cost due previously announced plant closing, lower employee and energy cost and better pricing. Corporate costs were higher mainly due to mark-to-market accounting on company's stock and has deferred compensation account. As Dave mentioned on October the 1st, we completed the acquisition of four metal beverage plants from Anheuser-Busch InBev. Interest expense was increased by approximately $5 million in the quarter as result of the acquisition finance timing. And we expect net earnings from the newly acquired plants to be flat or only slightly positive in the fourth quarter because it of its quickest accounting adjustment and plan integration expenses. We anticipate full year capital spending will be reduced to around $200 million in 2009 and full year free cash flow to be at least $375 million. Free cash flow will not increase notably above 275 million this year, due to increased working capital levels in some businesses. We plan to focus on paying down debt after the recent acquisitions and expect free cash flow in 2010 to be significantly greater than in 2009. With that I'll turn it over to John.
John A. Hayes: Thanks Ray. Let me talk first about the acquisition and then provide some color on our operational performance. I will prophase my comments by referring to our remarks in the second quarter. We said our focus was on cost management and balancing supply and demand. We wanted strong assets in the right places to serve our customer base and we wanted to be flexible in this dynamic market place and ready for when growth returned, while we operated profitably in this economic environment. Our results are showing fruits of those efforts. And now with the acquisition, we have some additional loss that's on the table that will make our system even better. The The AB InBev acquisition fits nicely into our strategic plan of growing our global beverage can business. After making a required fourth quarter inventory valuation adjustments that Ray alluded to, we will quickly see the benefit of those plants early in 2010. We are absolutely focused on best practice between the new Ball plants and our legacy plants. The sharing of practices is a two way street; the successful system plant concept we implemented during both the Anheuser-Busch InBev acquisitions is in place today. We fully intend to steal shamelessly from each other in order to enhance Ball's low cost manufacture status in beverage can making. Now in August we named Michael Hranicka, Chief Operating Officer of North American metal beverage packaging operations. We wanted Michael in place to guide the inauguration of the new plants. His disciplined systematic approach and his focus on getting close to our customers of selling the term. And Michael in his team are off to a great start. This follows our announcement earlier this year naming Gerrit Heske, Head of Ball's European business. These moves demonstrate our focus on talent management and we fell very good about the leadership team we are putting in the place for the future. Now turning to the Operations: Profitability for the quarter in our metal beverage packaging Americas and Asia segment was up noticeably versus last year. As Ray mentioned, a blend of cost savings, price, mix and exceptional plant performance contributed to the segment's improved performance. Overall industry volumes in the U.S. were down approximately 1% in the third quarter with beer volumes almost flat and CSP down a little over 1%. Our volumes had beer being up and CSP being down for the quarter, and overall we were down relative to the market. However, we remain focused on balancing the value versus volume equation in this business. We have having some conversations regarding current CSP negotiations. We are executing on costs optimization plans and we have added four low costs well run plans in our biggest business that will help us drive further improvements. In China, volumes were flat in the quarter and profit performance was improved due to price and lower cost inputs. While Europe's volumes were relatively flat in the third quarter. To insure that supply was matched with demand curtailments of selective lines occurred in the quarter and we remain committed through short term and long term measures to balance our supply with the realities of market demand. To that end we have decided for the time being to postpone to start up the Lublin, Poland plant subject to further market developments in the region. We continue to believe that Central Europe will be an area of growth once the economy recovers. Turning to our food and household division year-over-year segment EBIT performance improved. The vegetable pack started late but was very strong in almost every region and ended just a couple of weeks ago. The strong pact, affective supply chain management and continued cost savings related to prior plant closings, offset low single digit volume declines in food and high single digit volume declines in aerosol containers. Plastic package in America has reported a decline in EBIT in the quarter. Unlike our other packaging businesses, volume did not improve quarter-to-quarter. Custom foods and beverage containers volume gains were not enough the offset the double digit volume declines in CSP and sports drink categories. We closed on the sale of our plastic pail business near Atlanta to BWAY on October 23 for $32 million. We acquired this product line in 2006 with the acquisition of U.S. can and it wasn't a strategic focus for Ball. Now turning to aerospace; the successful launch of the WorldView-2 remote sensing satellite earlier this month highlighted some of the unique capabilities of this business. In fact, we were able to view the first images just 11 days after launch which is truly world class and highlights our unique capabilities. We said earlier this year that the second half would be challenging for the aerospace segment. Year-over-year EBIT performance declined slightly in the quarter while backlogs held fairly constant at $563 millions. We continue to have proposals in the pipeline. We often describe this segment as being lumpy and right now we are in the same part of the lumps. But we know our capabilities and we are optimistic about our prospects for new business. Additionally, across all of our businesses, we are making progress in our sustainability efforts, whether its is reducing energy use, water or waste, our focus is on driving additional economic value for the company. We are leveraging innovation platforms as well, like the reclosable beverage can end, the Alumi-Tek bottle and PET wine bottles, all of which have sustainability advantages. And of course we continue to work with our customers on increasing the recycling rates of our products and benefiting from that increase, both economically as well as environmentally. In summary, operating performance in our packaging segments is very good and improving. Our cost rationalization programs are bearing fruit and we will continue to focus on balancing our supply with our demand. We anticipate taking additional down time in the fourth quarter as market conditions want to position our business for 2010 and beyond. Our people are focused on the right things and we are all excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Dave.
R. David Hoover: Thank you John and thanks Ray. This was another good quarter, a stronger quarter in some ways than we anticipated. We are seeing improved results in North American beverage can segment. Our plans across the board are running very well and we have an acquisition in our largest segment to provide an additional catalyst. We certainly expect to have a better fourth quarter then we did last year. And we are optimistic about 2010 particularly if the economy improves. And with that Sarah, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (operator instructions). And our first question comes from the line George Staphos with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi guys, good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: First question or two is around the balance sheet. It looked like receivables were up fairly substantially in the quarter, I am guessing that's largely due to the impact of Metal Container Corp or were there some others to consider. Similarly was there any excess inventory that you took into the fourth quarter on aluminum or steel and might that have cost you any margin in third quarter?
Raymond Seabrook: Joe, this is Ray. Let me... yeah, the balance sheet is a little confusing. Let me see how they healthy are. You remember that we closed on our acquisition financing around August 20th I believe by the end of their acquisition that closed October the 1st. We had around 40 days, sitting with $700 million and so what we did was, reduced, if you want to... we reduced about $90 to reduce revolving debt that we could pay out easily. $250 million, we used to reduce our AR securitization program. So AR securitization program at the end of June if you will, it was $277 million and at the end of September it was zero. And so we used that money to take that out and the rest, you can see on the balance sheet that's cash. But if you look at the cash-flow statement, the best way to look at it, just add $227 million for the third quarter, changing working capital and add 250 million for the nine months, than you are going to get the numbers that look more understandable. Its really has got to do with the AR securitization program.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I got that.
Raymond Seabrook: ...million dollars ahead on free cash flow. We didn't, to my knowledge we didn't carry any extra inventory into the fourth quarter. John, do you want to answer that?
John Hayes: No. That's correct Ray, we did not.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Was there any charge related to inventory in the third quarter?
Raymond Seabrook: No inventory charge of any kind in the third quarter.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay guys, I will turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph A. Naya with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Research: Good morning guys.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Research: I was just curious in the Metal Beverage American, Asia obviously is a very strong quarter. Could you provide additional color as to kind of what the big moving parts were maybe the magnitude what you saw on the quarter?
R. David Hoover: Well, I will start it John, and why don't you chime in to. We, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we have been due to recession in the business, closing plants and doing other things, and we are beginning to see real positive results from that, the cost savings that we were talking about and so on. So that came to the forefront, so as Ray had said, no negative metal in the quarter, and we are running very, very well. Will you amplify that John?
John Hayes: Yeah. Its exactly what we said at the second quarter where we expected going through, we would see the cost savings as Dave mentioned and you hit on the lack of inventory and the exceptional performance of our plants.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Research: In terms of maybe the benefit from restructuring, you gave an idea of what that was in the quarter?
R. David Hoover: Its always difficult to break this out little bit. But if you with recall on our first quarter conference call, we laid our very clearly our expectations over the next 12 months and we're delivering on what we committed that we would.
Joseph Naya - UBS Investment Research: All right, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes form the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Hey guys, good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Could you give us an idea of what specially can volumes did during the quarter, not just in North America but Europe as well.
R. David Hoover: I can give you qualitatively; I don't think I have the specific information, but lets start with Europe. We mentioned in our earnings release that we continue like we have in the first half of the year a mix issue and what that effectively means as people have traded down from 50 centiliter that to 33 centiliter. That trend is continued, although it's updated a little bit, and it has to do with region by region, market by market. So, there is nothing new in the third quarter relative to what was happening in the first and second quarters. In North America, in the first half of the year we did see some slow down on that business. I think it has started to come back a little bit, in fact what we're seeing as we go forward as many of our customers are very much focused on differentiation and I would expect that you should see a wide variety of different sizes and different formats as we go into 2010 related to specially cans.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And remember. Sorry, go ahead. And just remembering that from last year when you delayed the plant in India, they've just given what's happened in the world in terms of the economy sort of improving your cost emerging markets, are there any plans to revisit that?
John Hayes: Nothing at this time is the best way to say, but we have plans in place for every region around the world. And as Dave liked to say the mode of an opportunity and that's what we are focused on, and make sure that for example; even in the Polish plant, yes we actually have seen improvement in Eastern Europe for example, in third quarter Poland was up slightly in terms of can volumes but not enough to start a new plant.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: And John just finally back to specialty volumes. Are you supporting the re-part of the producer, for the Coke slim can that's being offered.
John Hayes: Yes we are.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Claudia Hueston with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Claudia Shank Hueston - J.P. Morgan Securities: Thanks very much, good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Claudia Shank Hueston - J.P. Morgan Securities: I just had two questions, one I was hoping if you just comment a little bit on volume trends over the course of the quarter, particularly in the pastics business in Asia there is sort of flattish today, did itchange it all over the course of the quarter and then if there is any sort of notable change in any of the other segments in terms of volume trends, that will be great?
R. David Hoover: Okay. Well the PET, to be honest; we had expected to see improved volumes in the PET side of the business that did not materialize. Although our food and specialty side of that business was up mid single-digits. I think the issue really has to do with just less share of stomach for all products. If you look across all the various non-alcoholic product lines which PET plays a part, everything effectively is down. And so I do think that people are just drinking less packaged soda, less packaged water, less packaged soft sports drinks etcetera. In terms of just trends that we saw in other businesses, nothing out of the ordinary that we haven't mentioned before. On the beverage can side, the promotional activity really didn't give us this much of a boost as were hoping for although what I would tell you is the can, as a sheer package mix on it has been improving. And so CSP was down, it was down less than overall CSP. And the beer continues to hold up reasonably well. And then we've talked about the terrific food pack that we had and that went into, even into October. So I don't think there's anything unusual there.
Claudia Shank Hueston - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. That's really helpful color. Thank you. And then just real quick, just on your corporate expense. Could you just tell us how we should think about that going forward?
R. David Hoover: You want to comment on that Ray.
Raymond Seabrook: Yeah, as I said. The main thing in this quarter is that the positive up... the biggest side in mark-to-market and on the stock price. So, if stock fell in deferred accounts which fair amount of it is, its mark-to-market and the beverage put to our P&L. So, year-to-date, we probably had $6 million of that, we also had an increase in IC side. But, if the stock price is up a lot, that number moves and if it goes down, actually we put a credit through believe or not, but that's how generally accepted accounting principles work.
Claudia Shank Hueston - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities: Good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities: I wondered if you can give us some sense with the Brazilian plant coming up here a little bit later in the quarter. What sort of the benefit or drag we might see from that over the next couple of quarters?
R. David Hoover: Yeah. The first line is actually, we saw pictures yesterday as running some cans as oppose to start production mid November. And really we expected it to be additive from the good going.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And then...
R. David Hoover: While the plant is sold out, so.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And could you just give us a little color on this CSP negotiations that you mentioned and in what point you might have some clarity on what that does or doesn't do for you?
John Hayes: It was, this is John. As I said in my opening remarks that we have been making good progress, I think everything is on track and I think it would be remise to say anything more than that at this time.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. All right, very good. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon. Please proceed with your question.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Yes, good morning. Ray I know back in July you had mentioned that you saw about 50 million incremental free cash flow from the acquisitions of the InBev plants, a little less than that in the first full year and of course you had the early close. Could you just update us on that, is that where you still see the numbers., I guess I will just also tack onto that for all of you guys. Do you see the potential given the, ease of closing this deal for maybe another can plant or to, to be available to be purchased, do you think that's a possibility.
Raymond Seabrook: No, it’s with the free cash flow. As I said, we were little disappointed this year, the fact that we had businesses and we are going to put some working capital in those businesses and that's a temporary phenomenon. So, if you look at our 375 this year, I think we are still thinking that, that number is 50 million on an on going basis for this prior plant. A little bit less in the first year because we have some things to do. But fundamentally is we expect to get that working capital out next year. So when you kind of do the math you are going to see that we expect to have significantly very strong next year in free cash flow. As far as additional plants, I will turn that over to Dave, and who knows.
R. David Hoover: I thought maybe you were going to answer that Ray. All right. I don't think we would speculate on that. Certainly, we make no bones about the fact that we were trying to grow our global beverage can business and we are delighted actually to have these plants part of Ball Corporation, they are running very well we will see what the future holds. So, actually a little dance around your answer.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Okay. And just shifting gears just quickly. We have seen in the last six months, PepsiCo buy their beverage plants, sorry their bottling plants. And have you noticed any difference in their sort of attitude or plans in the future toward pushing volume vis-à-vis price? In other words, could that be a positive or maybe a concern of yours?
R. David Hoover: Well, specifically with respect to the cuts you mentioned, no. I do think and they've publicly stated, this is one of the reason, they are committed to CSP and that's one of the reasons why they're acquiring these two bottlers, and they want to move things to market quicker, that's what they said. When you just take a step back and look what's going on the CSP volumes are down across the border, irrespective of what range you are talking about. We do know that they are very much focused on getting that right, it has had headwinds depending on what customer you are talking about in terms of some of their hedged material, whether its high fructose corn syrup, whether it's aluminum, things like that. As those things start to come off, I think they are very much focused on reinvesting in their business to make sure that they are not losing any share gains and making share that they are maximizing best value versus volume equation. I had mentioned earlier that they are looking at a variety of new formats and other things like that. I think you should expect that that's going toe increase as we move forward.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Yes, thank you. Good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: I was curious, if you could maybe give a bit more color, if I missed it earlier I apologize. But looking at your overall volume situation in Europe. Have you seen any recovery in Eastern Europe today and if so do you think that we could see that recovery as we had into early next year?
R. David Hoover: Well, good question. There has been a slight growth in certain parts of Eastern Europe. But as I mentioned earlier, not enough to give us confidence to start up a new Lublin plant. Just to give you example in Poland, in the third quarter it was up mid single digit, the Czech Republic was up a few percent, these where markets that have been in decline up until the third quarter. So, I think this bottoming out if you want to think that. The question is as you move forward in 2010 what kind of trajectory do we expect that. We have talked about the world cup being in the same time zone at least of Europe next year which should be helpful, because it's a very big promotional event for beer customers. We expect some improvement, just to be honest, I think many of our customers are putting plans in place right now in terms of the pricing their promotions, their volumes and it's a bit too early to say anything, although I do believe that worst is behind us. And then even in Western Europe, we saw some good this quarter in France, in the UK, it was offset a little bit by Belgium and Southern Europe that kept the overall market relatively flat. But we are seeing some signs of some recovery in certain parts of Europe.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a very good third quarter.
R. David Hoover: Thank you.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Couple of questions for you. First is, Ray if you could please expand on what the working... maybe just a little more color on what the working capital was that took a little more here through the end of the year. I heard what you said earlier about the adjustment in the accounts receivable lines, but I was thinking that would have probably come off or a balanced off by the end for anyway, was there something else?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, what happens is, when you make that adjustment to the line, it goes through changes in the working cap. So as I said before, Chris The other thing we could have done, we could bought 700 million and put pretty much the 700 million in cash and what we did was with the better use of the money to pay down the AR program, so that's why your balance sheet and cash flow looks a little strange. If you take that affect out of there what you will find is year-to-date with $200 market ahead on free cash flow compared to where we were last year. And so the way to think about that is, that basically increases the receivable line by $250 million. Basically that line, that was a better return for our money than to leave the money in cash, it’s that simple. So year-to-date I believe on an apple-to-apples basis we are $200 million ahead on free cash flow from where were last year.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. No, that's right. I just didn't understand if it was just due to the... what you did with receivables if there was anything additional.
Raymond Seabrook: Well, as a matter of fact as we say in today we are already into that line. We probably closed on the acquisition and that line is back in place. So we consider that is new lines that's back in use. So it just happened to be, if moving to the end of the quarter it's a little confusing. But as I said, if you add $277 million to new increase in changes in working capital in the quarter and add 250 for further date, you are going to get comparative numbers.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. And then the second question I had was, you had the Metal Container assets now about, 29 days or so in counting. Any thoughts early in this first month is, surprises favorable things you've seen, maybe unfavorable things you've seen. Just some early thoughts on how you're feeling at this point.
R. David Hoover: I think as I said in the opening, we find them to be as good or better than we thought and we did significant due diligence. These are excellent facilities and the people there are great and I've been communicating for last 2-3 days with some of the Plant Mangers, I want to go see their plants, and they seem delighted too. These are very large, very productive, very low cost plants and they are working really very well. I think, John, you might comment on the factor sharing and other things that we are doing and what we are beginning to see.
John Hayes: Yeah. Its, to amplify on Dave's point, one of the facilities that we acquired, not a week after we had acquired it had an all time daily production record of over 9 million cans produced in the day. That is truly world class, we had a bunch of people led by Michael Hranicka who go out from literally hour one after the acquisition, go to all four of the plants, spend some time with the people really get the people engage and lay out what we mean by best practice sharing. And as I said in my opening comments it truly is a two way street. This is a first class operation like ours. We do some things a little differently and now we need to identify whether its an how you move metal through the system, how you call off various things, how you plan the warehousing all that. There is best practice sharing and we truly are going to steal shamelessly from both of them as we go forward and its most importantly is to get the engagement of the people as one team focused on these are not former AB InBev plant, they are new Ball plants.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Perfect. Thank you gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of areas of discussion here. First; wanted to talk about the Americas beverage for a minute and the sequential improvements second to third quarter. I know you mentioned there was three areas of cost, sales, price and mix. And if we look back at the second quarter call, it seems like the cost saves probably around and about 10 million a quarter. And you had something like a 10 million inventory gain. Is the rest just price or is there some improvement out of China that you've had?
Raymond Seabrook: Let me take that. Roughly basically, as matter in the second quarter we still had some inventory losses on loan, they weren't huge but we had some loan losses again in the second quarter. When we were at the third quarter, as John alluded to is that, approximately $12 million of that improvement is related to the plant closing talks that both John and Dave talked before. A lot of the other improvements in North America, it's a lower energy cost, lower labor and benefit cost. In China; we had improvement as well for primarily volume was up just a little bit. They were pretty flat, but they are up just a little bit. We had some currency gains in the China and we had again, the plants that are working very well in China. Offsetting all that, leaving that, we had fact $4 million loss due to lower volumes.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just shifting to the plastic side of the business with the sale of the plastics plant to BWAY, did that reflect any change overall and the overall strategy for the plastics business. And could we expect that you would start to see some of the cost saving initiatives that you have taken in plastics, show up in a quarter, in the next couple of quarters?
R. David Hoover: The plant that we sold made large plastic buckets, think of it that way, for things like cool chemicals and so forth. So it was not a fit with anything that we do. So, the fact that we sold that plant, it was kind of also within our plastic business, any way it actually came to us as part of the U.S. Can acquisition. So, hopefully the BWAY folks will be able to add to what they do to have a nice business, it just did not fit with us. So, I wouldn't assume that, that has any impact on the rest of our plastic business. John you want to comment on the that cost savings.
John Hayes: Yes. The cost benefits from the closed plant really only had a very small impact in the third quarter. Largely because Baldwin's Village finally was the largest facility ran actually into the third quarter, ran until the end of August. So we expect to begin the flow these cost savings to flow through in the fourth quarter and then really hit hard in 2010 relative to the full amount of cost benefits realized from those closings.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the plastic side of things. Is it really just a volume issue in the plastics business or is there something out structurally that's a bigger challenge for you there?
John Hayes: Right now its really just the volume, volume issue.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital: All right, good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to I guess follow up on the cost save. I think you guys were targeting 80 million of total cost savings over 2009 and 2010. And as we are in October and as you total this all up, kind of where are you tracking this year and what's incremental next year relative to the $80 million goal that you had?
R. David Hoover: Well, I don't know. I shouldn't say that. I think there were probably, these things all happen at different points in time. So I think we were still looking to get at the end of the second quarter with another 50 or more and we got some of that. We will still be getting some benefits as we go into next year. I would say at least halfway through the year as everything adversaries and we get out of there. It gets increasingly difficult as time passes through, find every dollar and say that it adds up to 80. But what you will see is, despite either this quarter in improve results, Ray just mentioned we had 12 million of that in the third quarter. So...
John Hayes: Yes. And you really have go plant by plant. I mean if you think about the eight facilities we have closed and we talked about this on I believe in the first quarter. We had three facilities in North America and metal beverage, it was can't... we said we really wouldn't get much of the benefit until 2010 because we were shipping out of pattern to fulfill customer contracts. We came to see that we really didn't start getting benefit until the second half of the year and we are clearly seeing at the numbers, and also the same with Puerto Rico, although that's not all that big. On the food and household products side of the business; this year we are getting a full year benefit of that and if I remember correctly its in the range of $15 million and then on the two plastic plants as I just alluded to, we really aren't getting much of anything, certainly we haven't got much yet and we will get a little in the fourth quarter but then we will really get the run rate in 2010.
Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital: Okay, all right. Okay. I just wanted to make sure, I mean I am kind of coming out if 20 million incremental cost stays next year, but just wanted to check that against kind of where you are tracking. Okay. On the, I guess switching over to the aerospace business, can you talk a little more about the pipeline, potential project pipeline there? And do you see potentially that you could grow your backlog again next year?
R. David Hoover: Yeah, I think that's a possibility. Here John mentioned in his remarks, the fact that the backlog sort of stabilized in the quarter. And really they are performing better than we thought they might through the first nine months and I think they will all year, this year. We haven't had the... had to have the reduction in forces that we might have anticipated and so on because of wining some business as we go along. The thing that's somewhat heartening and you don't know until you win or loose. But we have been bidding on a number of programs lately and we are optimistic that we are going to start winning some of those. So we can't declare victory, but at least my feel on this business is its beginning to turn a little bit. I don’t know, John?
John Hayes: Completely agreed as Dave said, that we are seeing a lot more deal flow if you would like to call it that and just on probabilistic point of view, when we are seeing more of that we have more opportunity in so, as you said its all on the count. But I think the tone and tender of the market place in which we compete is much more constructive today than it was six months ago.
Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital: Okay. Thank you.
R. David Hoover: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Thanks. Good morning.
R. David Hoover: Good morning.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Couple of questions. In metal food business, I'm curious that you mentioned that the food pack is continued a little bit into October I'm curious on, if you could characterize this season how much the how much the food pack is slipping over to the fourth quarter or how much was captured in the third quarter?
John Hayes: Well, as Dave just mentioned in Colorado at least not much, because we have about two feet of sewer underground. But it was an above average pack, point one. Some of it did carry over until the fourth quarter, point two. Not tremendously so, but I think the first frost happened about the 9th or so of October which really ends the other couple of days after that, but it really ends that. But that is usually trying to shoot you can get to the first week of October that's usually pretty good, we got little bit pass that which is a little better. And so overall I think we should, we did get some benefits in the third quarter that will continue slightly into the fourth quarter
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay, that's helpful. Now I know previously there was some discussion that consumers may have been shopping their pantries. I am curious as you look at the supply chain out there, presumably its kind of hard to hide a lot of cans out there. But what's your assessment as to the supply chain and whether there is been a depletion of cans through the pipeline including consumers?
John Hayes: I think not only on the food can side but whether it's all sold or whether its PET we talked about earlier, there has people that are just buying last things. It gets to year-over-year comparisons in the trajectory of those trends. We believe generally speaking probably the worst is behind us in terms of that. The question is, will people start consuming back to their old habits? And that's a question only for the people that own crystal balls. But we feel reasonably good where we sit right now, that most of it is behind us and because people still need to eat, people still need to drink and the question is are they going to be drinking tap water or CSP and are they going to be eating fresh or canned foods, and we feel just generally constructive about where we sit right now.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay. And just lastly if I could, coming back to European can business, Eastern Europe in particularly you touched on some points of follow on getting little better. I'm curious and how you think about the market longer term that if you had double digit gains there not too many years ago. Has that market matured so that you are just never going to get back to those rates of unit can consumption or are you thinking that you are going to get back there and suggest this from our modeling standpoint, I mean what's the outlook for the level that we ultimately get back to.
John Hayes: Long term, we still believe that there is a fair amount of embedded growth in Europe generally, obviously markets are definite. But just let me give you couple statistics that helps that out. The can share of the package mix in bear and Europe is about 18% and North America is 49%. So when you think about the trends from two way packaging to one way packaging that early favors things to can particularly when they are at the 18% level. There are certain markets that are, in Europe that are over 40%, there are certain metal in the single-digit market. But based on that fact alone you can have flat beer and the same works for CSP. But you could have flat consumption for trades of packaged mix going from two way to one way will provide some upside lift over the long-term.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay.
R. David Hoover: I think we are seeing... as you see the rebound in oil prices, that's got to be gift for the Russian economy. I was just reading a piece this morning what Russia has got to do and some of us were there recently. But what they need to do is diversify their economy away from raw materials. They are trying very hard to do that, and with oil trading 78 bucks a barrel versus 40, that's quick shot in the arm really to the economy there, that was one place that with can quite a bit. I think the other Eastern European countries by and large are just on a... probably into converting the cans and a lot of that was driven by the consolidation on the part of beer industry. That certainly continues and its definitely related to the state of the economy. And we saw signs today, although we are not adding job in the U.S. as much as we wanted, we currently bottomed out in the second quarter and had a 3% growth or something in gross domestic product and in the third. So too early to think its our victory, but cycles happen and I think hopefully we will see the worst of it.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Very good. Dave lastly if I could quick one for Ray. Do you have a preliminary estimate for capital spending for 10 and today you commented on a couple of the key spending projects you are working on.
Raymond Seabrook: Well, we don't have an estimate yet for 10 but we have a general feeling and you have been hearing from both David and John is that, until the demand picks up we are not going to be putting capital to work until we know we can get a return on it as you might expect. So, as we see today I wouldn't expect full year capital to be too much different than it is year to next and that's something that's contingent. John, do you want to add anything to that?
John Hayes: I think that's generally right.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Very helpful. Thank guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi guys. Ray, it maybe a little bit too early to provide any more precision and the guidance on free cash flow as its substantially higher for next year. But are you in a position at this juncture to be able to bracket that at all. If not, conceptually we had 50 million for MCC as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong on that. What are the other sources of free cash flow improvement that you are expecting for next year if you wanted to stack rank them?
Raymond Seabrook: Lets just say it was flat George. A good way to think about that is, is that we said we expect to have reached 375 this year, and we are going to put in into equally worth of $70 million of the additional capital. And, hello?
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: I am here, yeah.
Raymond Seabrook: And probably about $70 million of additional capital. So on a normalized basis you could add that to issues number and then add 50 to it, to get your starting point. We would not expect to increase contain additional capital going to our business next year.
R. David Hoover: The 70 is still capital rating, give me working capital.
Raymond Seabrook: Hey, we are on that working cap.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And so...
Raymond Seabrook: It said, that's a temporary increase in working capital that was we expect to see it, to be able to get out of next year.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So again to summarize we're starting with 375 plus 70, plus 50, I realize it never works out quite that mechanically. And then presumably some upside from earnings, if we have a better versus the worse global economy?
Raymond Seabrook: That's a reasonable way to look at this earnings point.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I appreciate it. The other thing I wanted turn to is, within PET, you have already done a fair amount of restructuring within the business. I think in answering one of Rick's question earlier it is not much as you expect to see from a structural standpoint in terms of improvement from here. Is there anything that you can do from a marketing standpoint to improve the performance of the business or are you just really at this juncture more or less waiting for people to look at their pocket books at the gas stations and like to buy bottled water and gatorade.
R. David Hoover: Well, I think we are doing a lot particularly on the food side and food and beverage side, non-PET. The soda and water sales, you're hear on one of the big problems right now, Its not being acquired certainly and it can be in stores and even in grocery stores the way it was. If cans are gaining share, that's sort of the market, they're gaining that at the expense of something and some of it is that, so I mean, I think we are working hard on new product development and with some success over selling some more heat-set container, some polypropylene containers and so on. But on the other side of the coin, I think we've got to see hopefully our customers promoting and people wanted to buy of these things.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Dave, in the custom side of the house, is it down on its own or does it need the scale even if its not getting much of a return on its own from the, if you will on the commodity side of the house and PET?
R. David Hoover: Well its not a large business but, it was a separate business within Alken when we bought it so...
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Right.
R. David Hoover: It is little larger now than it was than, so.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: All right. Last question I will turn over. In terms of promotional activities form your customers and soft drink this year its been, seemingly from our standpoint on again, off again, on again off again. And with that, there is a back up then perhaps whatever the alternative you are telling now, minus so we have a heck of a lot of lead time into the future. But what are they telling you right now in terms of their expectations for promotional activity into 2010.
R. David Hoover: Yeah. They are telling us right now, is that they are very much focused on it, its really looking towards 2002 and they are putting together all the variety of plans, promotional activity pricing strategy, all those things in place as they go into 2010. So I think its still a work in process for them. And so our discussions with them, they need to get through the work first.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right guys, I will turn it over. Thank you.
R. David Hoover: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Feinman with Iridian Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: I have been asking you about securitized receivables, every quarter for about the last five years, but the one time when it actually would have been a quick question. You have answered it before, I got a chance to get in the queue.
John Hayes: Hey its John. I am sorry about that Andy.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Since I wasn't fast enough. But so the 200 million capital spending includes Metal Container Corp, is that correct for this year?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes, that's correct.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Okay. So, I think the last time we talked about, maybe on the last call it was looking it was going to be maybe 40 million or 50 million higher than that. So can you talk about what you've, what brought it down?
Raymond Seabrook: Lublin.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: All right, okay.
Raymond Seabrook: Now that's a biggest piece, and then of course. And we have been really careful about everywhere we are spending money, we are being very cautious as we look at this economy right now. But the big number, the big move down is Lublin.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: So, there's a lot of... I mean, you have the 32 million from the plastic sale, you've got, I think about another 20 million coming in the fourth quarter from winding out of your collateral deals. And you have, if I'm trying to estimate, I guess if your receivables goes back to 250 which is around where you would like to run it between now and the end of the year. Okay. So then what would your... can you give me some kind of a bracket of what your net debt might look like at the end of the year given all those puts and takes?
Raymond Seabrook: Let me tell you that we are looking at somewhere like 250... some of that exchange rate has an impact on that too Andy. But we believe 2.4, 2 million 150 million like that, in that neighborhood.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Great. Okay, that's terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Burns with Cranial Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: Thank you operator. Two foot of snow would equate to a school day off, I'm impressed.
R. David Hoover: Well, what would you expect Tim?
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: This is kind of a goofy question and I don't know if its been approached, but the InBev Pepsi merger of certain purchasing activities. I mean it doesn't include packaging at this point. I could see how you guys could benefit if it happened. I could also see how you might struggle with it. Is it something to worry about or should we just shelve it for now?
R. David Hoover: You know, worry about. Its, this is a part of a broader theme just consolidation of customer basis and so we have in one way shape or form have been focus on this for a very long time. With respect to you're specific it isn't about packaging, its about two beverage companies coming together and looking at all their interacts. So as we sit here today we have got relationships with both of those good customers of ours and we wouldn't expect any material changes.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: Great. And John, where do you think the specialty can business is as a percentage of total today and maybe where it might had go? I mean it's obviously in high gear and probably will go into a higher gear into 2010. What are your thoughts?
John Hayes: Well I think its in the low double-digits, kind of low teens call it right now. I do think, just go into a store today and compare it to what it was two years ago in the high of the economy. You were just seeing a lot of difference format changes. Whether you define it as different sizes of cans or different packages of cans, you can see 20 packs out there that you couldn't see two years ago. You see a lot more 16 out on the shelf, you see a lot in terms of juices and other things going into the smaller sizes. You will start to see CSP going into the smaller and the larger sizes depending on the channel that they showing into. So I think this is a secular trend that isn't going away.
Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital: Thanks very much and good luck in the fourth quarter.
John Hayes: Thank you.
R. David Hoover: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen (operator instructions). And there no further questions at this time. Please continue your presentation or closing remarks.
R. David Hoover: Okay. Well, Sarah thank you very much. And thanks all of you for participating in our call. We will look forward to speaking with you again in January and will continue to work hard to make Ball perform well.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-07-23 11:00:00) =====

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ball Corporation second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 23, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Hoover: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding the company's second quarter 2009 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's SEC filings as well as in company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release it's available on our Web site at Ball.com. Information concerning the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our Web site. But with me today on our call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and John Hayes, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer. On a comparable basis, Ball reported diluted earnings per share of a $1.20 for the second quarter compared to a $1.10 for the second quarter in 2008. We're pleased with those results and they affirm our strategy and the actions we've taken over the past 18 months or so. Volumes are also picking up, and plant performance is really good and getting better. We're excited about an agreement we announced earlier this month to acquire four metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants from Anheuser-Busch InBev. These large low costs plants are in excellent fit within our metal beverage business and this acquisition supports our strategy to grow our worldwide metal beverage can business. These plants are well run by experienced can makers. We're confident that once this acquisition closes that we'll benefit immediately by sharing best practices, capitalizing on synergies, and improving our operations. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to Ball's earnings and cash flow in 2010. Next Ray will review the quarter from a financial perspective, and then John will discuss our operating results, and I'll close with a few comments about our outlook for 2009. Ray.
Ray Seabrook: Thanks, Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter were at 120 and through the first six months were at 197, up 9% in the quarter and up through the first six months compared to last year. Turning to the operations, second quarter year-over-year sales volume showed seasonal improvement compared to the first quarter. However, through the first six months sales volumes were down in all business segments with the exception of European beverage cans where sales volumes were flat through the first half. Along with lower aluminum prices, lower euro exchange rate also contributed to lower sales in the quarter and year-to-date. Offsetting second quarter reduced sales volumes were improved operating margins in all of our North American packaging businesses, primarily result of lower cost due to plant rationalization programs commenced in late 2007, inventory gains and food and household segment and better pricing. Lower interest expense and a lower share count due to our 2008 share buyback program also contributed to higher second quarter and year-to-date comparable earnings per share. Exclusive of our announced acquisition, full year interest expense should be $40 million lower than last year. The second quarter effective tax rate of 27% was favorably impacted by a lower tax rate on the gain on sale of DigitalGlobe shares. The 32% effective tax rate on comparable earnings in the quarter was a little better than expected and slightly lower than the forecasted comparable full-year effective tax rate of 32.5%. Turning to the balance sheet, net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was at 2.3 billion, almost $300 million lower than at the end of the first quarter, and $365 million lower than at the same time last year. We're working hard on de-leveraging the company prior to closing on our recently announced acquisition. We still anticipate full year free cash flow in the range of 375 million and capital spending below $250 million. Finally, a few comments about our recently announced acquisition. As Dave said, we expect this acquisition to be earnings per share accretive from the outset. Once we get by year one, which will require a little more capital than the out years, we expect this acquisition to generate approximately $50 million of free cash flow per annum. And assuming we close the acquisition this year, the pro forma credit quality ratio is at the year end will be better than they were at the end of the first quarter. If you remember, the first quarter credit quality ratios had net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9 times and the rolling four quarters adjusted EBIT to interest coverage at 4.9 times. With that I will turn it over to John.
John Hayes: Ray, thank you. Momentum is beginning to build across our businesses and we've begun to see some of the positive results from the actions we made over the past 18 months flow to the bottom line. Proactive supply demand management, disciplined approach to our commercial activities, meaningful cost savings resulting from our sustainability efforts and a continued focused drive for improvement throughout our packaging operations are helping to offset early volume declines. In Aerospace we had a challenging comp from a record 2008 second quarter but still had a stronger first half in this business than anticipated. As summer gets into high gear and we move closer to closing on the AB InBev acquisition, there is growing energy and excitement in our operations and we are absolutely focused on driving results and making sure every action we take creates value for Ball and our shareholders. Now turning to the operations. Profitability in the quarter in our metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia segment was down slightly versus last year. As we indicated in our prior call inventory holding losses on aluminum would impact the second quarter but to a much lesser degree. Barring this impact in the quarter results would have been improved year-over-year on lower volume. For the balance of this year we expect little if any impact from aluminum inventory gains or losses. Branded CFC continued its decline in the second quarter albeit at a slower rate. The 4th of July holiday stimulated much needed promotional activities from our U.S. metal beverage customers. Overall industry volumes were down approximately 1% in the second quarter with increases in beer volume offset by declines in CSC. Our volumes followed a similar trend with beer being up and CSC being down. Overall we are off a bit more than the industry in the mid single-digit range, driven by our decision to forego volume rather than reduce price in some locations as well as the closure of our Puerto Rico plant. However, our declines in the second quarter were nearly halved from the first quarter and volume trends improved sequentially during the second quarter. Given customer indications and what we're experiencing this month, we expect to see improved demand in the second half of the year relative to our first half performance. Now in China, volumes were flat year-over-year and performance was comparable to last year's. This is a positive when you consider that the second quarter of 2008 benefited from strong demand in advance of the Beijing Olympics. While Europe's volumes were essentially flat in the second quarter, continued shift to $0.33 centiliter can from 50 centiliter can impacted second quarter performance. Next product mix. Currency translation was the largest factor in the decline of segment results. Our European team is doing a good job of managing through the recent slowdown and assessments are being made to identify additional cost savings in the near term including curtailing selected lines to ensure that supply is matched with demand. We do foresee improved volumes across Europe as we move into 2010. If that materializes as we expect, we plan to start up our aluminum Poland plant which we had slowed during the economic downturn in the first half 2010. We are pleased with our food and household product segment performance. Better manufacturing performance, disciplined commercial strategies, a smaller increment of inventory holding gains on template steel, and the initial recognition of cost savings related to prior plant closings offset high single-digit volume declines in both food and aerosol containers. This business continues to be on track to deliver the profitability that we expect. As we approach the seasonal pack, demand is forecasted to pick up in the back half of 2009 and all indications point to a very strong pack season. Plastic packaging Americas reported a noticeable improvement in EBIT before counting for the charge to close two PET facilities and despite 10% volume declines in the quarter. We do expect improved momentum in volumes during the second half of this year, particularly in the custom side of our business, and the timing of our Watertown Wisconsin and Baldwinsville, New York plant shut downs are on target with Watertown now closed and Baldwinsville closing at the end of this month. Our innovation efforts continue to build momentum and play an important role in keeping us close to our customers. Over the last 18 months or so we have launched 25 new products that have resulted in 5 billion new or enhanced products in the marketplace. A growth of 1 billion new units in 2009 alone. Examples of our success include the Monster Import energy drink launched with our award winning Ball resealable end. Sutter Home introducing single serve wine and Ball plastic bottles made with the unique coating that provides more sustainable alternative to other barrier bottles. And Miller Lite can now be purchased nationwide in Ball's Alumi-Tek recloseable bottle. Ball Aerospace is performing slightly better than we expected given the continued uncertainty in Washington after the administration change. In the second half of 2009 we still see some softness as we deliver the remaining instruments slated for launch in 2009 and early 2010. We are beginning to obtain more visibility on order on contract flow. Last week you may have noticed news releases indicating that Ball Aerospace was awarded a significant contract from the U.S. Air Force to continue providing measurement and signature intelligence in advanced geospatial intelligence to war fighters as well as a contract for the hardware for second space test programs standard interface vehicle spacecraft. We have other proposals in the pipeline and we anticipate more good news and new business later on in the year which if won could provide upside to what we anticipate will be a challenging second half for this segment. In summary, we are confident that our focus on operating performance, our continued disciplined commercial strategies, our progress on sustainability initiatives, and our emphasis on optimizing costs will result in improved operating performance and cash flow over the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 and beyond. We have made measurable progress and we are not finished yet. Dave?
Dave Hoover: Thanks, John, and thanks to you, Ray as well. This was a good quarter. Maybe a little stronger second quarter than we anticipated. We're executing on our strategy, we're focused on reducing costs and increasing efficiency and we have an exciting acquisition on deck. I like many of you I am sure we would like to see a little more improvement in the environment outside Ball. That is the general economy. It's a different world and we're managing our businesses with that in mind. We're happy with the progress that we're making but we're also not going to get overconfident and we have plenty of opportunities in front of us to do better. We expect second half 2009 diluted earnings per share to exceed those of the second half of 2008. And consequently, we expect full year 2009 diluted earnings per share to be greater than 2008 results. And with that Myra, I think we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning.
Dave Hoover: Good morning.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: First question is on Europe. John, I was wondering if you could, if not precisely, generally break down what the sources of the EBIT variance were year on year, how much was, if anything, attributable to, again inventory costs that hopefully are now behind you?
John Hayes: George, very little of it was related to anything like that. It really had to do with the things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Number one being a shift from 50 centiliter to 33 centiliter cans. And then the second thing was currency. We talked in the first quarter a little bit about steel and as we go into the second half of the year we think we have some tailwind on that but that was not a big component.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, fair enough. The second question, as we think about free cash flow for the year, Ray, depending on how you want to adjust for the settlement last year, you're running, I think, anywhere between $60 million and $130 million ahead of last year's free cash flow number, roughly just operating cash minus CapEx, which would suggest that this year's free cash guidance of the range of 375 seems pretty achievable. Can you talk us through what some of the puts and takes around that might be? Because at least from our vantage point looks like that number probably has more upward than downward tension.
Ray Seabrook: Here is I would tell you, George. If you remember last year I think we overshot the mark by either these are $25 million or $35 million of what we thought. And so what happened is, working capital came in, working capital came in a little stronger than expected. These are numbers that hinges on what our year end working capital tends to be. Right now, as we look at it, we have commitments on metal and some other things that are going to make us probably have that working capital go a little higher. So probably, I think the 375 is good. We might see a little upside in that, but what you will probably see when we get to next year, you'll probably see me advertising a real big number, because some of that number that we're talking about coming out that, the amount we increase, the working capital issue will get it out next year. So I'm sticking with the 375, could be a little upside in that, and I think the real upside comes next year.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's very helpful. The last question, I'll turn it over, as we think about beverage can volumes in North America, you said that second half should be up versus the first half for the Americas in total. Should we be able to suggest from that or from that 2H versus 2H last year is up for North American beverage can volumes? Thanks.
John Hayes: Well, that's always a tough one to answer, George, because it depends largely on what type of promotional activity our customers are going to be doing in the balance of the year. What I would tell you is you've seen heavy promotional activity by the large CSD customers, particularly going into the 4th of July holiday. I think you see that generally speaking nationwide. How long that continues will play a big component of it, but we feel relatively constructive based on our consumer analysis and discussions with our customers regarding the volume in the second half.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi -- Robert W. Baird: Hi, guys, good morning. Hi, Dave, I was wondering hoping you could touch on what was the biggest variance relative to the expectations for 2Q? Was it volumes in the U.S. or Europe, cost savings, or something else? Thanks.
Dave Hoover: The reality is that everything was kind of a little bit better. You could see it in. I mentioned in my early remarks that our operations are running really well. So the production cost is down a little bit and that's pretty much across the company, with the exception of aerospace, aerospace actually finished up a little stronger than the revised forecast as well though for the quarter. So there wasn't any particular thing, Ghansham, and I would say pretty much across the board.
Ghansham Panjabi -- Robert W. Baird: And John this one is for you if you don't mind. The volume trajectory for European beverage cans in the quarter, if you could just comment on that and also what really gives you comfort that 2010 will be much better? Is it what your customers are telling you? Give us some color there. Thanks.
John Hayes: Well, that's a good question. Overall, European volumes were down a couple of percent in the second quarter and it was really driven by continued softness in eastern Europe, particularly in Russia. We are starting to see in eastern Europe certainly a stabilization of the volumes. We were seeing relatively high declines in the latter half of last year and early this year in places like Poland and other things. We've seen that stabilized. In fact, I think Poland was relatively flat for the second quarter overall, and we continue to see strong growth in the Balkan region, where our Serbian plant is running full out. So that's a little bit on the east. On the west, we're seeing pretty good stabilization in terms of volumes. I think overall western European volumes were roughly flat, and that despite a summer season that was okay in some parts, but certainly not terrific in other parts so. I think overall as we talk to our customers and we see these trends and see these facts that are dictating the trends, we expect to see 2010 to be up a little bit.
Ghansham Panjabi -- Robert W. Baird: Okay. And is part of that just based on maybe the World Cup as well or some sort of equivalent to that?
John Hayes: Well, obviously the World Cup in 2010 is going to be helpful. While it's in South Africa, it's in the same time zone relatively speaking than Europe, so that should be a big boost in terms of European volumes in 2010 yeah.
Ghansham Panjabi -- Robert W. Baird: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Manuel from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a terrific quarter.
Dave Hoover: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Couple questions for you. First, just couple kind of a random different direction questions. First, on the aerospace business, you talked about, and in prepared remarks a few contract wins. Could you give us an updated backlog number or could you maybe give us a sense as to when some of those projects will start to take hold? Are those 2010 events or…?
Dave Hoover: Yes, they are largely 2010 events. If I remember, I don't have it in front of me, but I believe our backlog was in the range of 590 or so.
Ray Seabrook: 587 in the press release is what we said. And so those are awarded, but they're not in our backlog just yet. So as we go forward those will start. Once we actually have the contract signed, they will start to go in our backlog.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: That's what I didn't realize, because it appears as though the backlog didn't move much. So these contracts aren't in the backlog yet?
Dave Hoover: That's correct.
Ray Seabrook: We have been won since the end of the quarter.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Second question I had was, actually for Ray. When you guys issued your press release in conjunction with the AB InBev assets, I think you had indicated first full year operation that EBITDA would be in the neighborhood of 94 million. Could you help us with what the breakout is between what the D&A component that is between EBIT and EBITDA approximately?
Ray Seabrook: Let me think about that. Some of that's going to depend on the, we have to write up the assets. We basically got a fair value of the assets, but you are going to find out, I don't have it right in front of me, but most of it, it's much more heavily weighted towards EBIT than EBITDA.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Alright. I'll check back with Ann, that's a number that would help us out.
Ray Seabrook: Yeah, I think we think depreciation and amortization is somewhere just a little north of 30. And I think we think that it's 102 million of EBITDA.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: That's a nice improvement then.
Dave Hoover: Of course, we don't have it. We don't own it yet Chris.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Well, no, but if you're finding more opportunities, that's terrific.
Dave Hoover: It is.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay, last question I had was with respect to kind of follow-on to the earlier question about volume in the second half here domestically in North America. Where are you seeing, where do you think you will see the principal improvement? Is it more in the CSD side or is it more in beer continuing to do well? What gives you better confidence here in the back half of the year?
Dave Hoover: I think it's more on the CSD side. In the first quarter, recall, we were talking about promotional activity, and that really didn't kick in until late June. It was really the 4th of July holiday. And through the month of July you've seen some very strong promotional activity across the board by the large CSD customers. On the beer side, we don't expect to see much deviation. It's been reasonably strong. I think the secular trends, given the macro economic environment are going to continue that, so the real improvement we expect to see is probably on the CSD side.
Chris Manuel -- Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dave Hoover: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Thein – Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning. First question for Ray. On the initial, when you were going through the InBev numbers, I think you said after year one, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but after year one, north of 50 million in free cash flow per annum?
Ray Seabrook: No, what I said is, and it was little confusing, we've got a little bit of capital spend in year one, and that we're still working out what that number is going to be. We may not spend as much as we think. We think we got a little capital spend in year one. Once we get through year one the normalized cash flow from that business should be around 50 million. In year one it's going to be a little bit lower. I don't know exactly how much capital we're going to spend. It's somewhere probably, the additional capital is probably somewhere between 0 million and 10 million. So you can probably look for anywhere 40 to 50 the first year.
Tim Thein – Citigroup: Okay. And the normalized 50 number, what just ballpark, what does that assume in terms of CapEx relative to D&A? Do you have that?
Ray Seabrook: That assumes ongoing CapEx for those four plants at just under $10 million.
Tim Thein – Citigroup: Okay. And secondly, you gave some commentary with regards to the back half earnings, if you look historically on our numbers, anyway, this decade, I think, save the last two, the second half was better than the first, and again, not pinning you down on guidance, but the back half of this year, you don't have this movement with regards to the inventory gains and losses, but presumably if currencies are anywhere near where they are today that likely becomes a tailwind in the back half of the year. So is there anything that you would you call out in terms of what we should think about the back half of the year that may be different than the first?
Dave Hoover: Well, I think that, we aren't going to have probably the net inventory gain anything like we had in the first half but we're going to get it out of the operations of the company, and I think you're right, Tim, I think, if we execute very well and so on, that pattern you talked about could repeat itself.
Tim Thein – Citigroup: Alright, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Claudia Hueston from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Claudia Hueston -- JP Morgan: Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.
Dave Hoover: Good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Claudia Hueston -- JP Morgan: I was just hoping you had had mentioned foreign exchange had an impact in the European business. I was wondering if you could just quantify that. And then my second question was just more broadly looking at specialty cans in the U.S. I just wondered how that business was holding up in this environment and what trends you're seeing there?
Dave Hoover: Let me talk about, when we talk about our exchange, normally we're talking about the translation of our European business into the U.S. dollar, sometimes we forget. Within Europe we get exchange gains and loss as well. We've Polish Zloty, we got the pound sterling against the euro, so inside our business also get gains and losses. We had some losses on pound sterling to the tune of 3 million euros or 4 million euros and we had some gains on Zlotys 2 or 3 million euros so I think it's a net 2 or 3 million euro loss with exchange inside the business, in addition, the exchange rate of translation, translating those earnings in the U.S. dollars, euros about 20 cents lower was this time last year. We had bought some euro hedges to offset some of that, so. But that probably cost us $0.06 in the quarter, the translation of the European business into the U.S. dollars. That help you at all?
Claudia Hueston -- JP Morgan: Yes, that's actually great, thanks.
Dave Hoover: Okay, on the specialty cans, specialty cans have been a bit soft and it depends on how you define specialty cans, but let's call it everything other than 12-ounce containers. We've seen some of the smaller size holding up reasonably well. Some of the larger size have been a bit softer largely due to those are take out from the convenience stores for construction and other trades like that, but we're starting to see a lot of our customers put more emphasis on those things and I wouldn't say it's anything that you wouldn't expect in a soft economy. But it has been a bit more soft than what it has historically been the case.
Claudia Hueston -- JP Morgan: And are the margins still holding on those businesses even if demand is down a bit?
Dave Hoover: Yes.
Claudia Hueston -- JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Dave Hoover: Good morning.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: First question, getting back to the InBev acquisition, you mentioned in the out year free cash flow number, and actually you've been saying year one the free cash flow number is only different because of the incremental CapEx. Are you not because in any further synergies beyond what you get on closing and if you could also remind us sort of the timing roughly of some of the major contracts that come with that acquisition and when they would come up for renewal?
Dave Hoover: Let me talk about the synergies first. We've obviously had some synergies on closing because we're not taking G&A costs. We're not taking some allocated G&A costs. We're taking those plants and we are not taking any G&A. So that happens at closing. We are expecting some more synergies as we get the operations under. That was probably difference between my number and the number mentioned earlier. It will take us 18 months to 24 months to start getting some of that out. So the initial synergies is about 12.5 million of G&A costs upfront, and then the rest of it comes out over probably the next 24 months to 36 months.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: And the rest of that would be that 8 million difference in EBITDA….
Dave Hoover: Yes, that's got to do with some of this capital we're talking about as well. So we're going to make a few little changes here and there, which we think will get a little bit of synergies.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Okay. And can you give us a little color on the timing of the contracts?
Dave Hoover: I think that at this juncture what we said in our press release is that I think about 70% of this business is soft drink, and the balance was beer, and I think that's as far as we have gone or will go at this point.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Got you. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: Thanks, good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter.
Dave Hoover: Thank you.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: I wanted to ask a question hoping you could amplify your comments on the Alumi-Tek closeable boil opportunity and do you expect your can't share with us a little bit more about the number of the units you're talking about, the kind of growth you might expect, price points of the product, unit profitability, better or worse than your existing business. Just trying to better understand where you're going with this business.
Dave Hoover: It's a good question. In fact, it started out with the Miller Coors organization that they were trialing in various markets. They have now gone to a national rollout. It's in the range of 30 plus million units per year, and other customers as well have significant opportunities going into 2010, and in fact, we're going to be installing more capacity to grow that into overall not just with one customer, but overall in the 100 plus million units. It is a very attractive product for us. It's a new product. It provides a lot of backbone into the metal beverage container, and generally speaking, we ought to make reasonable returns on that business.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: Okay. And any sense of the price points of the product relative, I would imagine it's a higher price point.
Dave Hoover: It is a higher price point, both because it has more aluminum in it, it has slower speeds on how you manufacture it, and the technology is unique. But then also from a customer perspective, how they're pricing it in the marketplace relative to single serve versus six packs and other things that it really depends as they go forward.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: Okay. That's helpful. In metal beverage Europe, it was a little better than expected, and I was curious if you could share with us more about the unit volume progression year on year. And you mentioned the outlook for '010 is better, but how about the outlook for unit progressions second half versus first half, on a year-over-year basis?
Dave Hoover: Yes, exactly. I think for the first half it's been roughly, for us it's been roughly flat. The market has been down a little bit. The main difference has to do with we've been exporting some cans into Africa and some other export countries. We don't see going into the second half of 2009 any significant deviation from those trends. We do take comfort that on the beer side of the market as I mentioned earlier, particularly in eastern Europe, we're starting to see a stabilization of that, which has been soft. I do know that some of the CSD customers have been very strong in different countries as their execution gets better. But I wouldn't expect in 2009 to have any significant improvement relative to the first half of 2009. And if it does happen, that's all upside.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: Okay. That's helpful. And just last question, if I could, maybe a question for Ray on your outlook for tin plate, what's your sense as to where we may be headed 3Q, 4Q? And then as you talked about a positive seasonal food pack, I'm curious on whether the strong seasonal food pack is enough to more than offset potential destocking to the extent customers are waiting for price to come back down.
John Hayes: Yes, this is John. Perhaps I'll take it. On the steel side, we are starting to see steel prices begin to come down, but not near as much as the increase going into this year. We have been in discussions with our customers regarding this issue, and we've communicated to those relevant customers that once our higher costs inventory is flushed through, we will discuss providing them the benefit of lower steel prices but not until those higher costs flush through, could be several months, and we don't expect margin loss as a result because quite candidly, we can't take on the commodity risk. With respect to your question about volumes and destocking, in the first half of the year, the destocking was a little bit more than we had anticipated. You could speculate on the reasons why, maybe it had to do with steel, maybe not. But as we're entering the heavy pack season, they no longer can de-stock because as you know, when you pull crops out of the ground, you need to be processing those crops relatively quickly. So all indications across the board look good for a very healthy pack season.
Pete Ruschmeier -- Barclays Capital: Very helpful. Thanks, John.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). And your next question comes from Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Skidmore -- Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Thank you. John, just a question with regards to where are you in the progress on the cost savings being realized from the plant closures that you've done? And what else might there be as you go through the second half of the year? And it looks like all the plastics savings coming in 2010, is that correct?
John Hayes: Well, no, we're going to get some of that in the second half of 2009. As I said our Watertown facility closed at the end of June, and our Baldwinsville, New York facility will close at the end of this month. There's always a several month delay in giving the savings because of decommissioning. Recall in the first quarter maybe I direct you to that we spent some time talking about it, going plant by plant in terms of the rationalization on what we said is we really expect in the second half of this year to see a lot of the benefit, and then the full amount of the benefit going into 2010, and I think we're right on target with all of that.
Richard Skidmore -- Goldman Sachs: So just to clarify, the second quarter didn't see a lot of the benefit, and the bulk of the benefit of what you talked about in the first quarter is really second half '09?
John Hayes: Yes, for the most part, again, recall we did get benefits in our metal beverage container because the Puerto Rico plant had been closed at the beginning of this year, but Kansas City was in the decommissioning phase during the second half. During the second quarter the can facility has been closed, but during 2009 we're incurring higher freight. On the food and household product side, we have been getting the benefits as we said in the prepared remarks, related to the closure of a couple of aerosol plants that happened at the beginning of this year, and then on the plastics side, last year, we closed a small plant in Ontario, which we get some benefit, but that wasn't a big mover. So as you can see lot of the benefits, the full amount is going to start to occur in the second half of this year.
Richard Skidmore -- Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Nia [ph] from UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Nia – UBS: I'm sorry if I missed this but did you quantify kind of the magnitude of the inventory holding gains and losses in the quarter?
Dave Hoover: No, we didn't, but I think our CFO can do that for you.
Ray Seabrook: Thank you, Dave. Well, we normally don't like to do that, and I'll tell you the reason why, is because a lot of things go into it. You start looking at scrap, we create scrap that in the operation we sell it back to the scrap company. So depending on what you include or don't include you can get some different numbers, but fundamentally I would tell you it's between 10 million and 12 million is the inventory (inaudible) between the two businesses. Obviously North American beverage had a loss and the food business had a gain. So the net numbers somewhere between 10 million and 12 million probably when you include everything.
Joseph Nia – UBS: Okay. Also was curious kind of certainly you got plenty on your plate with the InBev acquisition, but what are your thoughts in terms of other potential expansion. You mentioned if markets hold up you may bring Poland on line. I know you put India on hold previously. Have you thought about any further expansions overseas?
Dave Hoover: I think internal to the business, organic growth opportunities, you mentioned a couple of places that we continue to look at that, it's not good in this business to build it and they will come. So we're not going to be doing that. But certainly we have opportunities that we've progressed to a point that if and as the market comes back, and you mentioned two or three of those, we look in the growing parts of the world for that if and as the economy comes back I think it will. We're seeing signs in China. You see the government announcing up to 8% growth. That's not like 15 or 12 that they used to have, but still significant. So we'll keep our eyes on that. I think also importantly is that we will continue to look because our financial situation is such we're pretty well financed company. Ray was saying a little bit earlier that even with the close of the acquisition our credit status gets stronger by the end of this year than were in the beginning. So we haven't stopped looking for things to acquire that might be really good fits and we'll keep doing that.
John Hayes: To amplify Dave's point, in terms of the internal growth, for competitive reasons, obviously we do not want to disclose exactly what we are looking at, but we have a priority list in every region in the world of where the growth is and what the opportunity is, what the potential timing is, who is the customers are, what the competitive dynamics are, and we review that regularly to see when and if it makes sense to pursue in a more aggressive manner.
Joseph Nia – UBS: Very good. Sounds like nothing necessarily going to talk about today, but you maybe a little bit more optimistic than you were last quarter.
Dave Hoover: Oh, I think that's clear. I mean, I just go back and revisit the question earlier, our first half was pretty darn good for the company, second quarter in particular, first quarter benefited more from this inventory situation than the second. We don't expect much of anything to happen in the second half of the year, yet we're talking about the possibility of beating it. So I think that when you see that, what you see is that business is performing better.
Joseph Nia – UBS: Okay. Great, thanks a lot.
Dave Hoover: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Al Kabili from Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: Good morning, guys.
John Hayes: Good morning.
Al Kabili – Macquarie:
Ray Seabrook: I think if I remember right we said the first quarter was divided up a third, third, third I think, and then I think the first quarter was closer to 20 million in North American beverage.
Al Kabili – Macquarie:
Dave Hoover: Probably a little higher than that. We said $10 million net, so since beverage also lost some in the second, so the food's going to be a little higher.
Al Kabili – Macquarie:
John Hayes: Yes, overall, as I said before I believe overall industry volumes were off in a 4% to 5% range. Our volumes generally speaking in both businesses were off a little bit more than this. We're not concerned though. On the food side, we're more skewed to the seasonal business and the decline relative to the market was really driven by timing differences and different markets, different segments, et cetera. We talked about the strength that we see in the pack going forward. On the aerosol side, it has been a bit softer. We have seen pickup more recently in terms of positive year-over-year trends, but in the second quarter alone they were down largely because of the do-it-yourself and whether it was paint, when it was automotive, other things like that, that served the aerosol market serve. They were just a bit soft but we are seeing them come back.
Al Kabili – Macquarie:
John Hayes: Well, it is July 23rd so, I mean, we can't manage business day by day in terms of the volume. So what we're seeing, at least month to date, in the month of July, is better volume trend for roughly flat to up slightly year over year. As we said here today, but again, couple weeks doesn't necessarily make a trend so I wouldn't read into that too much but that is just yet another proof point that when we talk about volumes we expect to get a little bit better in the second half of this year as we sit here on the 23rd of July, they are a little bit better.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: Okay. And maybe the better way to ask it is, the volume trajectory through the quarter I think you were down maybe mid single digits, but through the quarter, how did that progress through the quarter, that, that volume trend in Americas best?
John Hayes: I mean we've talked in the past about volatility. It was strong in April, it was a little bit weaker in May and strong in June.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: Okay. And then final question is on the InBev asset acquisition, just any update on how you are planning on financing this. Are you generating some decent free cash flow, but want to get your thoughts on debt versus using some of the free cash flow that you are going to be generating?
Dave Hoover: Yes, obviously we've got a real good idea what we're going to do. We're going to look at two or three different options. We may grow with some (inaudible) we may look at some other options as well. So you will stay tuned and you'll see fairly quickly here what we're going to do.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: If you take a look of it all the cash that we're generating here with this just this acquisition, we don't need a lot of extra money.
Dave Hoover: Except we've some big financings coming up in 2010 and 2011, talking about other growth opportunities.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: Okay. And final question, if I may, you talked about potentially curtailing some capacity next year, if you build that Poland plant. Any way to think about what kind of earnings impact that may have next year if you do that?
John Hayes: No, to be honest, I think it's too early to predict anything like that. We were discussing it earlier this week and once we get through the summer selling season and the contractual negotiations with our customers we'll have a much better sense, and as we talk all along what we try and do is match our supply with our demand. Until we get the demand nailed down in a more clinical way, country by country, region by region, it's just premature to talk about it.
Dave Hoover: And I think in John's remarks when he was talking about selected downtime in Europe that's right now. We may talk about next year.
John Hayes: That's more of the second half of '09.
Al Kabili – Macquarie: Okay. I'll turn it over. Thank you.
Dave Hoover: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Alton Stump -- Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick question with inventory gain in US food, is that going to be gone completely in the back half, just help us model out of profitability?
Dave Hoover: Alton, the simple answer is it's gone.
Alton Stump -- Longbow Research: Okay. Great. And then just looking at Europe is there any sort of color you can add in terms of breaking out how eastern Europe is doing versus western Europe? If I recall, it look like in April there were seeing some growth returned to western Europe. Is it still eastern Europe is really dragging and your overall volumes there?
John Hayes: Yes, I think I mentioned it earlier the notes you heard a bit. The short answer is eastern Europe has stabilized, but it has been softer than western Europe.
Alton Stump -- Longbow Research: Okay, great, thanks, guys.
Dave Hoover: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Simon [ph] from Iridian Management [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Andy Simon -- Iridian Management: Thanks. Listen, I just want, first of all, in case any your customers are listening, I just want to tell you, I have two teenage boys, and they're both very athletic, and they love Gatorade, but I'm afraid to buy it for them because there's so many different kinds now that they tell me specific instructions what kind I'm supposed to buy at the super market, and when I get there, my head is spinning. They have G, they have X, they have G2, and so, yesterday, I went down there, and I was ready to buy 10 or 20 bottles, and I came back with three bottles. So I thought there was a good article in today's Wall Street Journal. I hope they fix that. But the reason I got in the queue was to ask you about one other thing. Your 375 million of free cash flow, that doesn't include you getting back your collateral which I think is about another 50 million in the second half. Is that correct?
Dave Hoover: Yes, that's correct, Andy. We should get the other 50 million back in second half. That goes through investing activities. That does not include that.
Andy Simon -- Iridian Management: Right. But it will still be cash coming in.
Dave Hoover: Yes, that will be part of debt reduction, there's no question.
Andy Simon -- Iridian Management: Right. Okay, thanks.
Ray Seabrook: Thank you. And you know, figure that out and buy more of those bottles.
Andy Simon -- Iridian Management: I'd like to.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Yes, I had just a quick follow-up. Some of your competitors in recent, in the last week or so have talked about basically relying less on bank financing for the seasonal inventory needs that, of course, you see in the food can area. Is this something that you all may think about doing as well, keeping a sort of higher cash balance and depending less on a revolver for the time being?
Dave Hoover: Not at all. We don't think about that at all. We intend to have the revolver and we're not sitting on cash balances.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Got you. Okay. And then just also, you mentioned the Poland plant now being finished. What is a sort of influencing you the most to go ahead and move forward with that? You mentioned that eastern Europe the volumes seem to be a little bit coming back or stabilizing better than western Europe, but also I'm sure when you build these plants, as Dan mentioned, you don't build it, they come. Were you able to solidify volumes in the last few months to a point where you feel more comfortable?
John Hayes: Well, yes, generally speaking, we have agreements with our customers, but then it depends upon the demand of our customers, and what we're seeing is I mentioned eastern Europe is much better than it's been. Generally speaking Poland has been flat, every other country other than Russia is kind of up in the second quarter. So those types of trends in discussion with our customers, we expect those trends to continue, whether it's in Czech Republic, whether it's in the countries east of where we're building our plant, in Belarus and other places like that, we just see demand starting to perk up a little bit based on our contractual commitments with our customers we think we will be able to get some of that demand, and that is a factor in looking at when we're going to start up (inaudible) plant.
Chip Dillon -- Credit Suisse: Got you. Thanks.
John Hayes: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And we have another follow-up question from George Staphos from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. I'll try to make it quick since late in the call. I guess first question I had, project net was a big initiative for you back a few years ago. I'm not sure you have much left in that if anything, but are there potential applications of what you learn from project net on a going forward basis as you grow the portfolio in North America?
John Hayes: I'm not exactly following your question.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Well, you improved your end making productivity significantly as you know, John, through project net. You're obviously buying a lot of end making capacity potential with metal container corp. Do you see opportunities to improve the productivity given what you know right now within that big facility?
John Hayes: To be honest, it's a bit early in light of what we've seen so far to commit to anything, but as Ray had mentioned we do see opportunities over the next 24 months to 36 months through a variety of things using a little bit of capital here, whether it's best practice, whether it's optimizing the footprint, if you will, from a supply point of view we do think there's some opportunities.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. Second question, on the most recently announced aerospace contract, which is a five year $600 million I guess, potential value, can you give us more detail on how that might work for you?
Dave Hoover: Well, yes, George this is Dave. There are three people who are awarded, if you will, parts of this contract, but it's what known as a task order contract. The current contract that has just concluded in the same place was a multiyear agreement. We won about 80% of the task orders on that contract. That doesn't necessarily mean that on the new one, which is a larger piece of business that we will, but we're already into it. And so if I had to guess, I would say at least half of that business will come our way during the course of the contract, if we're as good as we have been could be more. If we get bad, could be less.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Dave Hoover: Is that helpful?
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Yes, that gives us a little bit more clarity. And then the last question I had, can you update us to the extent possible on your efforts regarding the contracts for next year back to beverage can Americas, any change in your ultimate expectation in terms of improved returns? Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
John Hayes: Thanks, George. This is always a difficult one, George. As you know, we do have several contracts coming up for renewal. We're not going to discuss the specifics, but we have been very consistent that we're focused on the right blend of value and volume, and our conversations remain ongoing, and the tone is constructive. And as we sit here right now we're taking all the necessary steps to ensure that we remain competitive while getting value for our products and improved returns in that part of the business that we're below what our expectations are.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch:
John Hayes: We are very focused on that, George.
George Staphos -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Dave Hoover: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And Mr. Hoover, it appears there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back to you.
Dave Hoover: Thanks very much, Myra. You've done a really good job being the operator here, and thanks to everybody who participated in the call. We are going to go back to work now and try to have a really good second half. We'll talk to you in about 90 days.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-23 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Dave Hoover - Chairman, President and CEO Ray Seabrook - EVP and CFO John Hayes - EVP and COO
Analysts: Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets George Staphos - Banc of America Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse Tim Thein - Citigroup Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Alton Stump - Longbow Research Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital Al Kabili - Macquarie Joseph Naya - UBS Tim Burns - Cranial Capital
Operator: Welcome to the Ball Corporation first quarter 2009 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded Thursday, April 23, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, CEO. Please go ahead sir.
Dave Hoover: Thanks Mark and good morning. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2009 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that maybe expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. So with me today on our call are Ray Seabrook, Executive VP, and Chief Financial Officer and John Hayes, Executive VP and Chief Operating Officer of Ball. On a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share were $0.77 in the first quarter compared to $0.80 in the same period last year, which was a record. Our operations performed well in the quarter that is historically slow for us. Excellent results from our metal, food and household product segment had a net inventory gain across all our packaging businesses helped to offset a slow start in our other packaging segments where we have seen volumes increasing in April. We anticipate volume and margin trends[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:27:00 2009 ] will improve as we head into the summer season and the second half of the year is going to be stronger than the first half. And I think that's both relatively and absolutely. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ray Seabrook.
Ray Seabrook: Thanks Dave. As Dave mentioned, the comparable lower earnings per share for the quarter were slightly lower compared to last years first quarter record per share earnings. The lower per share earnings were primarily result of a slow start to the year in North American and Asian beverage can sales, negative foreign currency impacts in Europe and Brazil, some price cost compression in Europe and two less accounting days in the quarter. These items were somewhat offset by a consolidated net inventory holding gains across our packaging businesses, lower interest costs, a lower tax rate and lower share count due to our 2008 share buyback program. Turning to the operations, North America and Asia beverage can sales started slowly as I said in both places, accounting for approximately $9 million of the first quarter year-over-year [[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:28:00 2009  ]expiring[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:28:00 2009  ]][Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:28:00 2009  ] [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:28:00 2009  ]experienced [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:28:00 2009 ]shortfall with the sale of higher cost quarter inventory making up the remainder. The high cost inventory resulted from 2008 fourth quarter production curtailments which were followed by a rapid plummet in aluminum prices, which are reflected in our selling prices. To a much smaller extent higher cost inventory will also have some negative impact in the second quarter segment earnings. As we have talked many times before commodity prices are passed through on our packaging businesses. However, for the most part we retain the inventory holding impact on the pass through between the time the metal is purchased and sold. Generally inventory holding gains or losses are not significant unless there is extreme movement in commodity prices as happened in the past two quarters. The second half of the year should be much improved due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of the plant closings completed at the end of the first quarter and the elimination of the higher costs inventories. European beverage can sales were down slightly in the first quarter compared to a year ago with a year-over-year segment earnings decrease attributed to foreign currency declines, higher cost inventory and some price cost compression, all about in equal proportions. Looking forward the high cost inventory issue is behind us in Europe and operating margins should improve by lower cost. The Food and Household segment is off to an outstanding start. Better manufacturing performance offset lower sales volumes in the quarter with most of the year-over-year segment earnings improvement attributable to inventory holding gains as a result of significant tinplate steel price increases. We expect strong performance from this segment throughout the remainder of the year due to the production consolidation program commenced in May 2007. First quarter equity earnings of affiliates were negatively impacted by poor manufacturing performance and foreign currency losses in Brazil. Brazil's currency loss has reduced diluted per share earnings by $0.04 in the quarter, due to primarily lower interest rates and a weaker euro. Interest expense is $10 million lower in the quarter compared to a year ago and is forecasted to be $35 million lower for the full year compared to 2008. The first quarter effective tax rate of 28% is a little better than our initial forecast due to a favorable foreign tax settlement in the quarter. The full year effective tax rate should also be lower and is now forecasted in the 32% range. Turning to free cash flow, we still anticipate full year free cash flow to be around $375 million and expect full year capital spending to be below $250 million. Credit quality ratios have improved with rolling four quarters adjusted EBIT to interest coverage of 4.9 and net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.9 times. With that I will turn it over to John Hayes.
John Hayes: Thank you, sir. As Ray, indicated a combination of factors impacted our Packaging segment EBIT mix, both positively and negatively in the first quarter. We have made much progress at Ball Corporation over the past 12 to 18 months. And while we're certainly pleased with the meaningful progress being made in the Food and Household product business, we still have much to do, particularly as it relates to the level of contribution being made by the remaining packaging operations. While a softening consumer demand has impacted the entire economy and we are not alone, we remain vigilant in proactively addressing those things that we can control. For example over the last 12 months we have closed or announced the closing of eight manufacturing plants in North America as we align our businesses with the current realities of market demand. Our recent announcement regarding the closure of our Baldwinsville, New York and Watertown, Wisconsin PET facilities is yet another proof point to this commitment of matching supply with demand. We have reduced staffing at more than a dozen other plants and we have reduced positions or not filled existing positions in our aerospace business in our support staff functions. Combined with the plant closings I mentioned, these actions have resulted in the reduction of approximately 12% of our total workforce. We have hired a new global head of strategic sourcing to improve our internal processes around the supply chain, and how we align our purchasing programs with our sales contracts. Year-to-date travel expenses are down over 25% versus 2008 as we leverage technology including the use of video conferencing and web casting. Energy, gas and water use per unit of volume is down across the board as we focus on our sustainability goals. And we have delayed many of our growth capital investment programs including those in Poland, India, Serbia and other regions until such time we see markets recovering. These are things we must do in order to ensure that we are fit for the future. Our focus is on identifying those things we do to add value for our customers and to eliminate things that add cost and don't add value. We are beginning to see results, while it can take 12 to 18 months for the effects of some of these larger initiatives to translate to improved[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:33:00 2009 ] profitability. We are confident we will see a positive impact in the second half of the year and into 2010 as a result of the actions that have been taken. Also occurring in the quarter was the naming of Mike Herdman, to the position of Chief Commercial Officer, Global Metal Beverage Containers; and of Gerrit Heske, to the position of President of our European operations. Mike has established relationships across our worldwide customer base that will allow him to effectively help address a wide variety of negotiations and other growth opportunities on the horizon. And we are pleased that he has accepted this position to ensure we receive proper value for our products, while staying close to our customers during these turbulent economic times. Gerrit Heske, on the other hand is a great example of our next generation of leaders. He and I worked extremely close together over the past several years. And his pragmatic, proactive and confident leadership style will suit him well now and in the future. Now turning to the operations, profitability in the quarter in our metal beverage packaging Americas and Asia segment was below our expectations. As Ray indicated this was driven largely by lower volume, higher cost inventory and inventory holding losses on aluminum. Our volumes in North America were down high single-digits. Driving this difference was weaker CSD volumes on branded products and slightly lower beer volumes. Many of our branded CSD customers continued to focus on value with prices increasing in the high single-digits year-over-year and volumes resulting in similar declines. Private labels which Ball did not have significant exposure to increased their volumes significantly on lower price increases. For the balance of the year, we expect some promotional activity from our customers as we head into the seasonally high summer months. In China, volumes were lower than last year due to the Chinese New Year falling early in the calendar year in 2009 and to a slight shift in packaging mix which we expect to abate as we move through the year. As we look to the remaining quarters of 2009, we expect profitability in this segment to be pressured slightly in the second quarter as we flush out the balance of higher cost metal inventory remaining in the system. Second half 2009 will benefit from savings related to our previously announced plant closures, improve volume and ongoing cost saving initiatives. In our European operations, volumes declined in the low single-digits driven by significantly reduced consumer demand across Eastern Europe offset by relatively strong export sales. Relatively speaking, France, the UK and the Netherlands held up well. Profitability was affected by higher cost inventory and negative product mix towards 33 centiliter packages, some price costs compression and a weaker euro relative to the dollar as Ray mentioned. As we move forward in the year we expect overall industries volumes to recover as we move into the summer months. April has seen an improvement in shipments in the mid single-digits versus 2008. We fully expect profitability to improve in the coming quarter since the higher cost inventory in this segment has already cycled through the system. Our food and household products group continues to perform very well and we see upside to the performance of this group relative to our expectations. Much better manufacturing performance and disciplined pricing strategy offset high single-digit food can volume declines as slightly higher aerosol declines due in large part to some pre-buying from our customers in late 2008. While much of the first quarter earnings improvement in this segment resulted from the inventory holding gains. This business is on track and ahead of plan to deliver the profitability that we expect. Volume trends improved sequentially throughout the quarter with March food can volumes approximately 15% higher over 2008 levels. Plastic packaging Americas continues to be challenged. As indicated in January, measures would be taken to maximize profitability and these decisions were made swiftly as market volumes experienced double-digit declines in the first quarter. Profitability in this segment will be up year-over-year, as a result of savings generated from the 2008 Brampton plant closure and improved pricing. In addition recent volume trends indicate a pickup in customer and consumer demand. Our aerospace business had a relatively good quarter with sales and EBIT coming in slightly above our expectations. During the quarter, the Ball built Kepler instrument was successfully launched and initial on orbit reports are favorable. Our antenna components and services businesses continue to grow nicely. However, our traditional space hardware business has slowed. The coming quarters bring more difficult comps for this business as the government contracting cycle has shown no real signs of improvement, margins can hold but on reduced volumes. The management team at Ball Aerospace has done an excellent job of managing its resources to match business demands. Even with the puts and takes of the operations contribution in the first quarter, we are confident that we will deliver improved operating performance over the remainder of 2009 and into 2010. Continuing accelerated benefits from the actions we began taking at the beginning of 2008 in our North American and Asia metal beverage and our plastics segments, continued proactive and disciplined execution of our food and household product segment, our sustainability and innovation efforts and our supply chain and other key cost optimization initiatives will all help drive our profitability and cash flow over the next months and years. With that, I'll turn it back over the Dave.
Dave Hoover: Well thanks John, and thank you Ray. Overall our comparable results for the quarter were very close to our record first quarter results last year. And as John commented we're not sitting still. We outlined the steps we have been taking in our operations and we continue to assess our business and are taking aggressive actions where needed to improve results. At the same time, volumes have picked up in April, and as we move further into the busier spring and summer season we expect that trend to continue. We’ll also begin to get more of the benefit from the plant consolidations we have announced, which will add momentum to our business. As a result we expect second half performance to be much stronger than the first half and full year earnings per diluted share to exceed last year's results. So with that, Mark, I think we're ready to take questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Couple of questions for you. First you mentioned some price compression in Europe. Could you elaborate a little more there? Is this something that's just a beginning of the year event or is this something that's going to persist all year, help us a little more dialogue there please?
John Hayes: Yes, Chris, this is John. It was a little bit more of --[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:37:00 2009  ],[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:37:00 2009 ] I'll call it the beginning of the year event. Recall that we make both aluminum and steel beverage cans over in Europe, and with the very strong increase in steel pricing that put a little price cost pressure in to the system. We expect that to be abating as I had mentioned in my prepared marks over the balance of year of though.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, that’s helpful. Then Ray you talk so fast. I'm just a simple guy, I get confused, but you talked about some benefits and [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:39:00 2009  ]in [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:39:00 2009 ]inventories. And you talked about how inventories had hurt you a bit in some of the different divisions. And I think you were referring to more hurt in the aluminum side and some help in the tinplate side, if that sounds right. But can you help us balance as a whole how it was across the system. Do you look at the benefits in one side roughly equaling the other side?
Ray Seabrook: Yes, I tried to talk nice and slow, but I guess I'm just not slow enough, anyways.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: (Inaudible)
Ray Seabrook: I understand. Its a net gain. In other words that we had a little bit more in food than we did negatives in the beverage business.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, so across the whole system a slight gain. That[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:40:00 2009  ]'s (tactical)[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:40:00 2009  ].[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:40:00 2009  ] [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:40:00 2009 ]
Ray Seabrook: Across the whole system, a gain, yes.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, last question I had was, as you talked about some of the plants closures and things you got going. Can you just refresh us? I think there have been a number of them both in the beverages and now in plastics and metal food. Now the cadence of the improvement from lower expenses i.e. plant closures and things as this year goes on 2009 and what carries over into 2010?
John Hayes: Yes, let me attack that. Recall that starting with food and household about 15 or 18 months ago we announced the closure of our Commerce in Tallapoosa. Those really didn't come out of the system until the first quarter of this year. And so we expect to see as the balance of the year, we expect to see the improvement starting flow through there. We also last year about this time announced the closure of Kent, Washington, we did say at the time because of customer contracts that we would incur some higher freight that we really wouldn't get the benefit until 2010. And then I mentioned Brampton in my remarks that we had closed and we are expecting to see improvement there. Then the other ones, Kansas City and Puerto Rico for example, Kansas City didn't come completely down in our system until the end of the first quarter of this year. And so, while we're decommissioning it right now, I think we're going to see the vast majority of benefits going into 2010. And then with the Baldwinsville and Watertown announcement we recently did that's really a second half event that we get the full benefit going into 2010.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, so just to help me put some numbers on these, as I remember food and household was, I think you guys had said at least $20 million, so that’s a (true) effect. For this year event, do you have some numbers for the others as well?
John Hayes: Well, I think when we talked about the other ones, I mean it is significant we were talking in excess of I believe $80 million or so of fixed costs. And as I said, because the timing of some of these we would expect the full year effects really to be more in 2010 although we will get some of the benefits be in 2009.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Banc of America. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos - Banc of America: I just wanted to be clear on the answer you gave to Chris, so the $80 million of plant closing savings is that the total or would there be an excess of that in savings given the food can plant closings?
John Hayes: No, I think if you go back, and this is all what we've reported when we announced these closures, that if you sum it all up, it's in excess of $80 million.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Okay, fair enough, thanks John. Now the second question I had, over the years the company has done a fairly good job of matching input cost with selling price, especially within beverage cans. The industry has moved in this manner as well. Why would you in Europe have some margin compression from higher steel? Why wouldn't you adjust pricing for steel beverage cans reflect the higher input costs relative to whatever you needed to charge within aluminum beverage cans[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:43:00 2009 ]?
John Hayes: Well, you know it varies so much. But a can is a can, and that's how we sell them in Europe. And so we get the benefits overtime of having a dual metal strategy. And as we all know that over the last six to nine months, aluminum has come way off and steel has gone up and so it has put us on a relative basis a little bit more pressure into the system. As we work off some of that and sell more aluminum relative to steel as I said before, we would expect to[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:43:00 2009  ] that to abate a bit over the balance of the year.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Okay and John just to maybe try to clarify a bit more. We appreciate all the detail that you have provided. Are we to take from your comments and Ray's comments and Dave's that within Americas and Asia beverage, we should assume down EBIT in 2Q but in the second half increases in EBIT year-on-year and within Europe how should we think about the comparisons over the course of the year?
John Hayes: Well I quickly take it and then I'll turn it over the Ray. Yes, we said in the North America beverage cans, we have a little bit of headwind because of this higher cost aluminum in the second quarter, but in the second half we are going to get the benefits from these plant closures. Then in Europe as we move through, remember last fall we talked about running for cash given the current economic environment. And what that did is put little deferred variances on our balance sheet that really flowed through in Europe and in North America in the first quarter. As those higher cost inventories flush out, we expect Europe to be sequentially improving.
Ray Seabrook: Assuming I would add to that,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:44:00 2009 ] George,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:44:00 2009 ] is remember that we said we had a little bit more of this to go in the second quarter in North America and Asia. Let's just say that and the gains from the plant closings is offset in the second quarter. And then the benefits for all these plant closings fall right straight down to the bottom line in the third and fourth quarter. So you would expect to see, the North American beverage wins a lot stronger. The other thing we haven't talked about is remember you got exchange. You got Europe at 150 last year first quarter and it's 130 as we speak, so you got $0.20 of exchange difference. So when you look at their sales and stuff,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:45:00 2009 ] $15 million of reduction in sales in Europe is not volume related it has got to do with exchange. So we had some exchange going on as well.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Understand, just trying to get a clarification. I'll turn it over guys. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Claudia Hueston with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan: I was hoping in the metal, food and household business you could just provide a little bit more color on the improvement you saw in the quarter and maybe just talk about what was price and what was productivity and cost structure improvements. And what was sort of inventory, if you could just give a little bit more color on that that would be helpful?
John Hayes: Okay, really a couple of things, I'll put the inventory holding gain (insight)[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:46:00 2009  ]aside[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:46:00 2009 ] just from I'll call a core operating perspective. Our commercial people did a very good job in managing a very difficult situation with the whole steel pass-through. And so we did a very effective job of passing those costs through. On the manufacturing side of those where we have seen the greatest amount of improvement. And just to give you a sense, in the first quarter on labor costs alone year-over-year we're 19% below last year driven in large part because we are very effectively managing our overtime and some other things, because we were getting better operational performance out of the line. So, both from the commercial side and from operating performance side, we were seeing improvement in all areas.
Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan: Okay, and then, I think you mentioned that March volumes were up significantly. Can you just talk about if there was one particular area and was that food cans and aerosols? Any color there?
John Hayes: Well it really has to do, we have to go back and look at the whole quarter. But starting out the year, despite our efforts to minimize the amount of pre-buy from our customers, we did in retro effect experience some pre-buy from our customers. And then after significantly reduced shipments in January, we did see sequential improvements during February and March. And as I said, March shipments were up 15%. April has started off a bit soft, but conversations with our customers indicate that for the remainder of the year we should meet our expectations obviously assuming normal weather and normal pack [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:47:00 2009  ]peak [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:47:00 2009 ]season.
Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan: Okay. And those churns are pretty similar in aerosols and food cans?
John Hayes: Correct, generally speaking.
Dave Hoover: This is Dave, Claudia. I think that if anything this year if you add together,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 16:47:00 2009 ] whether in North America and also the state of the economy, which has hurt demand for some of the branded products, we're probably seeing those factors make the first quarter more seasonally slow versus the rest of the year than we normally would. If that helps at all.
Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan: It does. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Yes good morning. On the tax rate just to be clear you mentioned rate for the full year would be 32%, but given it was 27% in the first, should we be using something above 32 to make it average out? Did I hear that correctly?
Ray Seabrook: Yes probably, we were in January and talked about the full year, we thought we have a tax rate closer to 33%. And so we had a settlement of an item in Europe that caused first quarter to be a little lower than otherwise would be. But yes you should use probably a little bit higher than 32 for the rest of the year. We should finish around 32, so remember we're going the make a lot more money in the rest of the year than in the first quarter. The first quarter is a very slow quarter for us anyways. It’s usually the first and fourth quarters are slowest quarters, the middle two are the highest. So, when you actually do it by dollars, what you will find is it won't make that much of an impact. But fundamentally, when we finish the whole full year, we expect a 32% tax rate rather than 33% to be had to advertise in January.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Got you, and of course, sounds like one way to look at this is that, that benefit was pretty much equal to the currency and other problems you had in the equity line?
Ray Seabrook: Yes, it just turned out that way. We had some currency losses I talked about in Brazil and the operations are not performing quite as well in Brazil as they had in the past. Those numbers just turned out to be relatively in the same magnitude. I think the tax adjustment is around 4 million US, and I think the Brazil as I said was like 4.5 million on the exchange.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Got you, and when you look at the, I mean it was just obviously lights out in the food margins mid-teens. How do you sort of see that moderating? How do you see that inventory gain working down? Do you think it will be back up in to the mid to upper single-digits say by the third quarter or will it sort of linger beyond that?
Dave Hoover: No, I think directionally, you're correct.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Okay. And so you probably as you said you will have some but not what you had in the first quarter as we look at the second quarter?
Dave Hoover: Yes, I think there is a little bit but not much. And so we're still expecting. We started a plant consolidation program in 2007 and we have been sort of advertising the earnings are going to get a lot hard in this business and we're on track. This year some of its going to be caused by this one time item that won't be repeatable, but we still expect the sustainable earnings in this business to be significantly higher than we have had in the past and we have been telling that you that all along.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Got you.
John Hayes: Some of that has been off set by some of the negative things in aluminum on the beverage businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup.
Tim Thein - Citigroup: First question is on the North American beverage can segment. I'm trying to figure out, I understand on the mix side and how that hurts you on the CSD side. But looks like now for several quarters you have been kind of close to or maybe worse than the industry and given that your mix is more heavily geared towards beer, I'm trying to figure out why that's the case. I think Kent, probably would have hurt you in '08, if I'm correct on that, in terms of skewing that a little bit. But can you just maybe comment as to why I think you said your beer volumes were down in the first quarter?
John Hayes: Yes, they were down slightly. It really has to do with customer mix. And without going into much detail, when you look at the various beer customers that the industry serves and we serve, some have been performing better than others, so it's not anything other than that.
Tim Thein - Citigroup: Okay, John, I'm curious your thoughts as a seller of obviously both cans as well as PET. What your thoughts are in terms of some of the bottlers as well as the brand owners have been a bit more vocal about changing the packaging formats and sizes and alike, and seem to be talking a little stronger about price over volume then they have in the past. How do you think that plays to again to the various package formats that you plan?
John Hayes: Just generally speaking you're right. They have been pursuing value over volume and that's actually been hurting them relative to private label and just based on our discussions with the various soft drink customers. That they're trying to get this right and they can't continue to experience declines there. So as you pointed out, they are trying a vast majority of SKUs. You have to remember, it depends on what channel you're talking about, if you're talking about the convenience channel, which is historically a PET channel they're trying some different things, but that's still a predominantly PET channel. On the food store side it's historically been more of a can volume and we expect that to continue.
Tim Thein - Citigroup: Okay. And lastly are you concerned about, I don't know if concern is the right word. The news here with Pepsi and PBG, that there is potentially some disruption ahead of the summer selling season. Is that an issue at all for you guys, do you think?
John Hayes: No, I don't think it is at all. We don't worry about that. I think really what our customers are trying to do, make sure their alignment within their system to make sure that that they can execute and get to market as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Just to clarify in the food and household, was the statement that you made that the sequential or the year-over-year improvement in food and household profitability was largely all the inventory gains. So you had a $30-plus million inventory gain there?
Ray Seabrook: Yes, that’s what I said. What John talked about is what we said in food and household, our volumes were down in the first quarter, so that’s a negative. We also said our price cost was positive. So those two kind of more or less offset to some extent. And most of the gain in the first quarter was the inventory holding gain. That won't be the case second, third and fourth quarter.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: All right just wanted to clarify. Then secondly Ray, can you just talk about use of free cash flow as you go through the year? And you've made statements in the past that you were targeting kind of 10% to 15% EPS growth. Given that you're not in a share buyback mode perhaps this year, should that EPS growth this year be thought to be more like 5 to 10, because you don't have the normal 5% share buyback?
Dave Hoover: Just before Ray answers that, Richard, I would like to comment. I think it’s hard for us to get right down to percentages. Our long term goal is still to grow 10 to 15. If things break our way, I think we can do that this year. We have got a average, you know I made the statement earlier we expect to make more this year than last year. It looks to me like we have got average over a buck a share in the final three quarters to do that. So we understand that, but to get real precise around whether it's 9.3% or 11.1%, or 7.2% is going to be hard to do at this stage. If things break for us, you know and the trends that we're beginning to see developing in volumes and that’s really in Europe, it is in the PET business as a matter of fact that we have seen it. We expect we are a seasonal pack food supplier and provided as John mentioned earlier, you know, the weather works and the fish swim and so on. We see a pretty good year and the thing that I am most encouraged about is that we got a hold of our business real tight and we are running it well. And we're beginning to see the benefits of the actions that we have been taking. So I think we have got a shot at meeting that, but I wouldn't say that here in late April, the game is still on the table. But we're fired up about it.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Thanks Dave, but from a free cash flow standpoint, share buy back is still not on the table for '09, is that correct?
Ray Seabrook:  At least for now, I wouldn't say ideally, we got one of our covenants is a little tighter than we'd like on restricted payments which affects our share buyback. We said that our plan right now is not to buy back shares and that we are sticking with that. We could get to the third or fourth quarter, and have a strong free cash flow. We could change that a little bit, but at the end of the exercise right now we are not buying back our shares. We don't plan to, we've got some other things that we think provide more value, and that’s what we are going to do.
Operator: Our next question come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: I think I kind of missed it, but I believe you had mentioned. I think it was you Dave, that you were seeing at least some rebounds in bev can volumes in Europe in April versus the first quarter result. Is that correct?
Dave Hoover: Yes, I think I said it. I think John said it too.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. And I think you maybe said that was up single-digits, is that right? Just wanted to get an idea sort what the outlook might be there if you think we'll see rebound continue over the next quarter or two or if you could see go back down to being down slightly like it was in the first quarter?
Dave Hoover: Yes, John why don't you comment on that.
John Hayes: Yes, one of the things that is going on you have to look at the markets and what's going on in the markets and first quarter is seasonally slow. We are aware that built stock inventories of our customers are relatively low. Last summer, recall it was not a pretty summer throughout most of Europe. So, it is as Dave said, it is only April. We are seeing some decent improvement in the volumes in the month of April, but the summer is ahead of us. And so, if things continue to go our way we would expect to see some improvement there.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: There is one other question on this whole inventory holding gain issue. Is there anyway we can get some clarity either now or in the queue on a per segment basis as to what the impact was in both bev and food cans. Just in terms of making, easier to model over next couple of quarters?
Ray Seabrook: Well, if you just go back to what my comments were, I thought I was clear. But maybe let me repeat it. Actually North America, I said $9 million of the shortfall was to do with volume. And I said the remainder of it was with the inventory. So if you subtract the two numbers you should be able to figure out what that is. And food, we've just clarified and said most of the gain was inventory. And in Europe, we said we had three things happen to us, which proportionately where about the same. So, I don't know how else to spell it out. So if you take the math and figure it out, I think you can come up with a number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Couple of questions, just to clarify if your European bev volumes were down and had some de-stocking and April was up nicely year-over-year, combining that what's your normal seasonal trends. It sounds like this year just seasonally, we're going to have a bigger variance. Is that fair in 2Q, 3Q relative to what you've seen in the past?
John Hayes:  As we were just talking before, we're going into the summer selling season. It is too early to predict anything. What we have seen is kind of month-over-month, and again it varies by country or by region, but we have seen a greater volatility in volumes on a month-to-month basis than we have in the past. Based on what we’re seeing as we sit here today, we think things could be improving.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Is there anything unusual about the year ago April to provide an easy comp for those volumes to be up so strong in this year?
John Hayes: Not that we're aware of.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Okay, that’s helpful, and maybe a question for Ray. I am curious about working capital, obviously seems to be seeing some big swings in pricing and costs. What’s your working capital expectation for the full year in terms of a put or a take?
Ray Seabrook: Well, you know that’s always a $64 question this time of the year, but if I look at what our forecasts are showing me, it's probably a $60 million negative. As John said it is a little early in the year, we always push guys when it comes to the end of the year. It depends on sales volumes. It depends on a lot of things. But probably, remember, we have had significant price increases in some of our raw materials. So, that alone adds working capital to me. So, we are hoping to make it better than that, but as I sit here today it will be a negative, just better [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:09:00 2009  ]a matter [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:09:00 2009 ]of how much. And then as we work through the year, depending on different factors that can move around depending on what we want to do. But it should be a negative.
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: Maybe just lastly for Dave. I'm curious if you can remind us your latest capital spending guidance, and if you think about kind of what you're key spending initiative are this year? And if you have kind of a back burner that you should put off for 2010, what are the kinds of things that you're thinking about in terms of priorities for CapEx?
Dave Hoover: I think we have put this in the release. We expect to spend under 250, and just how much under will be determined. As I mentioned earlier, we have got to hold the business real tight. In fact we were having, in one of our meetings yesterday, Ray assured all the operating people that we could beat that number by quite a bit and nobody said they couldn't. So, I think this is a year where we don't have, we are not spending. As John mentioned, we have stopped spending at the moment in Poland. We are ready to go ahead with that when we see demand turn. We've got some other projects around the world, places that have been talked about and that we have done so. So we're not spending growth capital right now, we're keeping our hand on the throttle, throttling back on any capital that we can without hurting the business. So I think you'll see us spend less capital. I think some of the cash,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:11:00 2009  ] [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:11:00 2009  ] that [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:11:00 2009 ]Ray is looking for may come out of that account. Does that answer your question?
Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital: That's helpful, and maybe just a last question related to that. If capital spending can potentially be beaten by a quite a bit under the 250, I don't want to read too much into this, but your free cash flow guidance is the same. I'm curious on other factors that may have changed, whether it's working capital or whether it's some of the volume issues or and if you could do elaborate or you are just being conservative on the free cash flow guidance? Dave Hoover First, it's early days that is one thing. Ray, just talked about the working capital number to some degree. Sometimes it's in your best interest as you approach the end of the year just as we do, to let that run up a little bit. The other thing that I think we all understand, I don't expect the amount of volatility going forward that we've seen in the last year and a half or so among some of the raw materials and other things that we buy. But as you work through this, a lot of people have hedged their materials and so on, and remember that is reflected in our numbers. So you may see a market price that's well off with hedges. It is not exposure for us but that could drive the working capital a bit too. I think we're just by nature, why would I want to grand stand and make any over comments about what might be nine months from now. You know nine months ago, where were we, as an economy and as a world? So I think we're just a little cautious. But we're comfortable saying that our free cash flow will be around $3.75. I hope we would there, but you know we'll see.
Operator:
 :
Al Kabili - Macquarie: I was hoping you could clarify a little bit on US beverage cans, just how much drag you see the inventory, holding losses in 2Q. What should we be expecting in the second quarter there, if you can give us some color there?
Ray Seabrook: Here is what to expect, it'll be single-digit first of all. But what happens is we talked about some of these plant closing costs benefiting this year, I mean that's all true. So, the plant closing costs we gained from that will offset any inventory effect. So, we'[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009  ]v[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009  ]e [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009  ]if [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009 ]said another way, both of those two things should offset. You want [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009  ]won’t [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009 ]to [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:15:00 2009  ]see, it'll look like there is nothing there. But in fact, we really will have an inventory holding loss and we'll have some benefits, some of these plants shutdowns that John was talking about. And you really will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarter for the plant shutdowns. That's why we're confident second half looks a lot better.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay. And to clarify when you say single-digit, you're and that's in millions of dollars?
Ray Seabrook: That's in millions, yes.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay, and in terms of cost saves[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:25:00 2009  ]savings[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:25:00 2009 ]. How much are we looking at total realized cost savings on the US beverage side this year? I mean, I know in total somewhere in the 40 million with the three plants you have shut last year in Kansas City, but could you just help us with how much you expect to realize in 2009?
John Hayes: To be honest I don't have that numbers off the top of my head. I do know as I mentioned earlier when I went plant-by-plant, the Kent Washington closure, we really don't get much benefit now because there’s any fixed cost benefit is offset by some freight in 2009 that will go away in 2010. Then on the Kansas city in Puerto Rico, as I mentioned we are in the process of decommissioning Kansas City as we speak right now, so we are incurring some cost there. But once that’s completely done which we expect in the second quarter,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:36:00 2009 ] the second half we should get those benefits.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay.
Ray Seabrook: I think you are right, I think those numbers are like around $40 million if my memory serves we correct.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay, got it. It’s just that you won't realize the full run rate of that this year, maybe half of it, it sounds like.
John Hayes: No, we'll get more than half.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay. I would assume in terms of the pricing escalators for PPI and what not. Doesn't that start to help a little bit in the second quarter in US bev as well, any way to think about that?
John Hayes: Yeah, it should, you know recall it as David mentioned before, nine months ago the PPI indicators were quite high, and all because of the last quarter they came down significantly. So, yes there is a little benefit, but it is not a huge number.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay, and then on switching over to food cans a bit. The $15 million of cost savings this year, did any of that show up in the first quarter? I may have missed that.
John Hayes: Very little, because as I mentioned, our two plants that we closed, we were actually running them in the first quarter. We shut them down during the first quarter so we really expect to see the benefits through the balance of this year.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay. Then finally on Brazil, you mentioned some operational issues you're having there can you give us some color there? What is the outlook of going forward?
Dave Hoover: Actually the three of us were just in Brazil and Argentina, a week or so ago. Part of that has to do with the fact that we started making 16 ounce cans in our existing plant and we are constructing a new plant. We're just beginning to construct a new plant. And not major things it cost us a little money and we're on top of it and had it fixed. It [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:39:00 2009 ]W[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:39:00 2009  ]w[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:39:00 2009 ]as introducing a new size into the plant and that caused some disruption and when you start and stop and change the size, some of that. Then [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:39:00 2009  ]I think we need to run a little better than we have been. So we've got people on it. It is not a major problem but it just caused performance to spike up a little bit. In addition to that 4 million or so that Ray was talking about in currency we experienced a little bit of softness we only get half of that because we're a 50% owner. That is what he was referring to.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay. And does this get better in the second, third quarter are you still fighting some of these issues on the operational side?
Dave Hoover: I think it will get better as the year goes along.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay and then two quick housekeeping questions. First on the tax benefit, could you tell us how much exactly the benefit was in the quarter?
Ray Seabrook: I think it was $[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:40:00 2009 ]4 million.
Al Kabili - Macquarie: Okay. And then second one was that last quarter you were hit a little bit on the unallocated corporate on the mark-to-market accounting hedges of 11.5 million. Was there anything going on this quarter related to that? And do you still see that reversing itself in the second and third quarter?
Ray Seabrook: That is a good question. What went on this quarter, believe it or not is another further million dollar mark-to-market at loss. So I'm at 12.5 million. And what I see is a gain of $3.5 million for the remaining three quarters. And it looks like a couple of million dollars may drop over into the first quarter of 2010.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Naya with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Naya - UBS: You kind of touched on this earlier, but I was curious, there has been a lot of talk that some of your customers may have the opportunity to do a little bit extra promotion this year with commodity costs coming back. Just wondering if you're seeing or hearing anything along those lines?
John Hayes: This is John. I think in conversations with our customers, yes we do expect them to be looking at promotional activity to help drive volume in their business.
Joseph Naya - UBS: So is it sounding like it might be more than we have seen in past years?
John Hayes: Well, I can't tell you if it's more than in the past years, but really over the past 15 months or so. The branded CST people have been going after value as opposed to volume, which effectively means price over volume. And as you mentioned as commodity costs begin to come off, it gives them a little bit more flexibility to focus more on volume.
Joseph Naya - UBS: Okay, also just curious with the timing of Easter. Do you have any idea kind of what impact that may have had in the quarter, if it pushed some volume back into the second quarter or if there were any issues around that?
Ray Seabrook: I think nothing material. It's in a seasonally slow time of the year, and usually you see promotional activity and other things in the heavy summer months. So, yes there was a three-week delay I guess in Easter this year, but we couldn't qualify it for you.
Operator: We do have a follow up question from the line of George Staphos.
George Staphos - Banc of America: One or two nitty-gritty and then a couple of big picture, we will try to keep it quick. First of all, Dave you mentioned where Europe is running currently in terms of volumes, mid single-digit. If you mentioned that, I missed it. Can you tell us what the early 2Q trends are in North American beverage can volumes?
Dave Hoover: Yes, do you have that John?
John Hayes: Well, I don't have it in front of me. We're not seeing big deviations yet, but again it is only the third week of April.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Okay. So in using your thought process and phrasing, if things break your way, such that you have a shot at the 10% or better or nearly four bucks of earnings power this year, what kind of volume would we need to see North American beverage at?
Dave Hoover: I don't know if we can get it that precisely. I think what will help us is two things, one if the beer guys begin to see a little more action in their side as John mentioned it has to do with mix to some degree mix of customers. And the other thing is the branded guys decide they want to sell more soda. And if they do, they always really push hard on cans.  Somebody was asking earlier will they do that what they did before. In my career I have seen this happen time and time again, and maybe with a little tailwind of some moderating costs, they can afford to promote more and if they do I think people will buy it.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Tell them they should do that Dave.
Dave Hoover: I did do that George. I actually use the products as well.
George Staphos - Banc of America: I try as well during barbeque season. In terms of thinking about the portfolio packaging business, it looks like food and household have finally reached the point where the business in total is earning cost to capital, and then some it looks like its strategic. Is that your view at this juncture and then we think about plastics in the same way? Realizing that the economic environment has not done you any favors in terms of volume. And maybe[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:54:00 2009 ] have been [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:54:00 2009  ]it's masking the underlying improvement. Is plastic strategic? Can this business ever you know [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:54:00 2009  ]10 years plus down the road earn cost of capital?
Dave Hoover: Well certainly it can, everything is possible in life. I think we're disappointed that volumes haven't been better as I'm sure our customers are in the first part of this year. But as we said I think we expect this to be an up year for that business. I think next year will be better because of the announcements of the plants closings that we made. We were talking just yesterday, we pulled $80 million out of the investments in this business over the last couple of years, I think. It is ours and we're making it better. Whether you tell me what is strategic. What is strategic is always what's doing well. And a lot of our company right now is on an upswing, including the plastics part.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Is your expectation and it will earn cost of capital in the next two years?
Dave Hoover: I think it's possible.
George Staphos - Banc of America: Okay. The last question, I'll turn it over. You mentioned your customers are really focused on value over volume. Obviously in the next year or so that becomes an important decision and metric for you all within the beverage can business in North America. As we think about it between the plant closings and may be the new announcements Mike and his new role. Why should your shareholders and investors have confidence that you get that right over the next year or so and what further work you need to do in that front?
Dave Hoover: The big reason, I'll answer and then John maybe you can chime in too. The big reason that shareholders should have confidence that we're going to get things right is that we're also shareholders. And its really more important to this management team than some, I would say that we perform well. But do you have some details for him, John, about how we're going to do this?
John Hayes: Well one of the things as we work or operate in a very competitive environment, and as you've seen from the actions we have spoken about, we have put an off a lot of emphasis on getting our costs right. And if you get your costs right, you can be very competitive in the marketplace. We want to get value for our products and we have a variety of different not only initiatives, but re-negotiations and negotiations going on and we want to make sure we're getting value for our product. And we'll see, but we[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:55:00 2009  ] as we sit here right now. W[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:56:00 2009  ], w[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:56:00 2009 ]e think we're taking all the necessary steps to make sure that we remain competitive not only now, but in the future and at the same time getting value for our products.

Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Ray I just want to let you know the Obama administration and the Pope have both absolved me from my futile comments about the death of the beverage camp[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:56:00 2009  ]can[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:56:00 2009 ]. Not many people want the talk about it, but aerospace looks like it had a pretty flat quarter. Its obviously a gem of a business. Has the new administration gates[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:57:00 2009  ]Gates[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:57:00 2009 ], the DoD, NASA, I mean do you guys foresee any major changes that would impact revenues and margins here?
Dave Hoover: I think John alluded to this, or just talked about it that and we have seen this with past administration changes. Things did tend to slowdown. So, the sort of traditional hardware business that we have doing, we haven’t been seeing or [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ]wor[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ]d[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ]s been[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ]work[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009 ] made for a while here that’s somewhat trouble some. The other parts of the businesses are actually growing, between the antenna and parts business as well as the service part of the business, but they aren’t growing enough to make up for not winning large for us [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009 ].[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ] G[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009  ]g[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:58:00 2009 ]ood sized jobs. We're chasing a bunch of them and hopefully some of this is going to start to break, whether that is the Obama administration or any administration. The other thing that I think is that the country is running large deficits. So, as the budgetary process goes forward and so forth, we've got to get a new head at NASA and we got to sort out what we're going to do. I think though when you talked about it being a gem of business, its rather on top and real and I think we're going to be fine. The good thing about it is, Tim that you can breathe with it up and down a little bit. It is not heavy fixed cost in that sense.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Got you.
Dave Hoover: We're hopeful of that. You watch everything that goes on with our government these days. And I'm not going to get into that, but sort of slow to respond in some cases. And what are their priorities?
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Got you. The other question I had, and I'll end it too. I'll hopefully get credit from you guys sometimes in the future. Is the metal, food and household packaging business, there is kind of, we've heard mixed results, the households, under [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:59:00 2009 ] on to [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:59:00 2009  ]the sink,[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:59:00 2009 ] cabinets[Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 17:59:00 2009 ] type stuff has had somewhat of a slow grow, but food as we know is still a bull horse if you will. Has value pricing there been something that's been pushed and can it continue to help you increase your margins?
John Hayes: Well, I think if I understand your question correctly in terms of how we're pushing our products to our customers, we face the significant price increase in terms of tinplate. And so we have been passing those on, we have been getting our costs right as we talked about before. And hopefully we have been getting value for our products. And I think the results in the first quarter and what we expect for the balance of the year are proof points of that.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Got you. There has been some sparing in price historically, but John you're brought in as a diplomat to kind of smooth that out. But we're just seeing that you're prices in particular could improve. Is that fair or not necessarily?
John Hayes: Well, we try and maximum the value of our products.
Operator: We have another follow up question coming from the line of Chip Dillon.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Yes, just a quick house keeping item. I notice that the corporate expense line was a bit more elevated than we have typically seen it in recent quarters. Is there anything going on we should know there? And when we forecast a full year, do you expect it to go up more than a few percent from where it was in 2008?
Ray Seabrook: You're talking about in the segmented earnings and the undistributed line is that the one you're talking about?
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Yes.
Ray Seabrook: Well that's higher this quarter primarily for mark-to-market. What I talked today, the thing that happened to us in the fourth quarter, the million where the $1 million. The other thing our compensation plans are stock based. So, our stock from where we were at the end of the year to the end of the first quarter has gone up some. So those costs are also in there.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Is there sort of a rule of thumb we should use when the stock goes up or down a point, how much that would change that line either per quarter or per year?
Ray Seabrook: I think fundamentally if the stock was up a $1, obviously there is a $1 million in that line if I remember right. Primarily that's a pre-tax number, so after tax it's $0.5 million. A $1 million increase in stock prices like $0.5 million on the bottom-line.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: After tax per year, per quarter?
Ray Seabrook: No, per stock price. So if the stock goes to $60 it's going to be a big number.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: No, I understand that, but when you said a $1 of stock prices about a $1 million pre-tax is that per quarter or per year?
Ray Seabrook: Well it's a $1 million on that undistributed line. So the cost of our equity programs go up increased by a $1 million. So that line increases by a million, but then your tax affect [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 18:01:00 2009  ]effect [Author ID1: at Mon Apr 27 18:01:00 2009 ]and it’s a $0.5 million we are trying to get there and that’s the bottom-line.
Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse: Right, and then if you look at the, you mentioned in the second quarter in North America and Asia of beverage cans certainly being better. But I believe you were referring solely on a sequential basis. You didn't mean to tell that year-over-year, did you?
Dave Hoover: You are correct on a sequential basis.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time.
Dave Hoover:  Okay, well this has been a good call. We appreciate all of you joining us. Appreciate your help, Mark on the phone. We'll talk to you again after the second quarter. We're looking forward to a good finish to the year. Thanks for being with us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation fourth quarter 2008 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only-mode. Afterwards we'll conduct a question and answer session. At the time, if you have a question, please press "1", followed by "4" on your telephone.  A rebroadcast of today's conference will be available beginning today through February 5, 2009. To access the rebroadcast, please dial 1-800-633-8284 and enter reservation number 214-0-6682. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 29, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover.
David Hoover: Thanks, Elainea, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that maybe expressed or implied. Some factors could cause the results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-Q and other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases.  If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With me today on the call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer and John Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  On a comparable basis, our diluted earnings per share were $3.61 in 2008, an increase over our previous record of $3.50 in 2007. This improved performance came during a global downturn that we all realize may be here for some time. In this economic environment, our businesses are performing. The products we make generally have been recession resistant and historically have done well, even during economic downturns. But we're not sitting still.  In 2008, we took a number of actions to more efficiently align our supply quickly with market demand. These actions and our continued strong focus on executing our strategy positioned Ball for improved performance in 2009 and beyond. There are accounting related impacts in our numbers that Ray will explain in a moment. John will provide more detail on our operations, but, all things considered, I like where we are as 2009 begins. While I hope the global economic situation improves, I'm optimistic about what we can do this year. Ray?
Raymond Seabrook: Thanks, Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, and for the year were $3.61, slightly lower in the quarter compared to last year; but, as Dave said, up for the year compared to last year's record per share earnings. Overall, the fourth quarter numbers came in pretty much as expected, with several notable exceptions. On the positive side, the food and household earnings were improved by the resolution of a claim in the amount of almost $7 million.  However, this gain was more than offset by an $11.5 million market-to-market accounting loss on aluminum hedge recorded in undistributed cost. For accounting purposes, the aluminum hedge became ineffective in the fourth quarter, due to large decline in aluminum prices; but from an economic standpoint, there will be no loss, as the aluminum hedge is back-to-back with customer contract and, therefore, will reverse in 2009, resulting in $11.5 million more earnings during 2009.  The final item of note was the $4 million increase in taxes due to the impact of the broad market decline on certain non-taxable benefit plan investments. Before getting to the operations, the other item of note is that on October 30, 2008, we announced the closure of two US Beverage Can plants and recorded an after tax charge of $25.2 million in the quarter to reflect these plant closings.  A net after tax gain of $5.6 million was also recorded to reflect the recovery of business consolidation costs previously expensed. We also estimate that an additional $3 million after tax charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 2009, pertaining to these plant closings. These closures, combined with the previous announced closure of metal beverage plants in Kent, Washington, are expected to be over $10 million cash positive of the final disposition of the assets, and cost reductions associated with the plant closings are expected to exceed $30 million in 2009.  Now turning to the operations. Earnings in the aerosol and food and household segments were up sharply in the quarter, offset to a large extent by lower earnings in North American beverage cans and plastics. Aerospace's strong quarterly improvement was driven by strength in component technologies, antenna and contract services. Improved margins were due to a favorable mix of higher margin fixed price contracts and lower overhead and benefit costs. Much improved fourth quarter food and household earnings were the result of higher sales, better manufacturing performance, and the claim settlement discussed previously.  Fourth quarter comparable earnings in North American beverage cans and plastics were lower than last year, due to lower sales volumes on favorable sales mix and higher costs due to plant downtime for inventory control purposes. While full year 2008 plastics earnings were disappointing, the business was able to generate almost $60 million of free cash flow for the year.  A lower euro in the quarter compared to last year reduced earnings diluted per share earnings by $0.02, and for the full year, a higher euro added $0.15 per diluted share, compared to 2007. Turning to full year free cash flow, $321 million was better than expected, primarily due to higher tax collections and lower capital spending in the fourth quarter. Net balance sheet debt at end the year-over-year was at $2.28 billion, a little higher than expected, due to $105 million of net cash collateral deposits made in the fourth quarter on aluminium derivative hedging contracts; we expect to have these deposits fully refunded in 2009.  Credit quality and liquidity of the company remain stable, with the 2008 rolling four quarters adjusted EBIT to interest coverage of 4.6 times and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times. Committed credit available at year end was in excess of $500 million. Although it's early in the year, as we look to full year 2009 earnings in cash flow, we project the following financial metrics.  Capital spending will be slowed and is estimated in the $250 million range. Free cash flow is projected to be around $375 million. US pension plan fund funding could be in the order of $25 million higher after tax, but pension expense is projected to be only slightly higher in 2009, at around $71 or $72 million. The consolidated tax rate is likely to increase to around 33.5%, due to projected higher US earnings, which is our highest tax jurisdiction.  We don't expect to buyback stock until capital markets show some signs of recovery. Initially, we will be reducing debt and growing cash balances in 2009. And finally, interest expense is also anticipated to be more than $20 million lower in 2009. With that, I'll turn it over John.
John Hayes: Thanks, Ray. As you've heard from both Dave and Ray, Ball Corporation continues to perform well. While we certainly are not recession proof, our broad mix of end markets and customers that we serve across all of our businesses should hold up well on a relative basis. Combined with our initiatives of taking a leadership position and all that we do, relentless attention and focus on doing the things right, taking necessary actions to ensure that we're fit to the future and managing all of this through detailed execution, we are faring well.  We believe the actions we took 2008 sets us up well going forward. As we enter 2009, overall we're generally on target on our pricing initiatives, our costs optimization programs, delivering value to our renovation efforts, driving our sustainable development, and being proactive around supply chain and risk management. We spent the last year focusing on these activities, which, given the environment, has allowed us to get ahead of the curve in terms of managing through this economic downturn.  Now turning to our various businesses, profitability for the quarter in our metal beverage packaging Americas and Asia segment was slightly above our expectations, but down from 2007. This was driven largely by our efforts to run for cash, which included taking a fair amount of downtime in the fourth quarter to manage inventories. Cost containment in this business remains excellent.  Our volumes in North America were off approximately 5% in the quarter, versus 4% for the industry. Driving this difference was relatively stronger CSD volumes, offset by lower volumes in the beer segment due to a previously announced decision to walk away from unprofitable business.  Volume comparables will become more normalized as we head into 2009. In China, volumes were up in the mid-single digits after adjusting for sales of beverage cans from a joint venture pattern. As we look into 2009, we expect profitability in the segment to be improved, driven by cost savings resulting from previously announced capacity closures, continued focus on our cost optimization initiatives, and continued growth from a variety of new product launches from 2008.  However, we will experience challenging EBIT comparisons in the first quarter, as we work off higher costs inventories resulting from the fourth quarter plant curtailment and the lying down of our previously announced closures. In our European operations, volumes grew in the upper single digits, driven by solid volumes in several of our core markets and very strong export sales, particularly in the second half of the quarter.  Profitability was affected by a negative product mix and higher freight costs that offset the volume gains as well as a weak euro relative to the dollar. As we look towards 2009, we expect overall industry volumes to increase in the low single digits, which is obviously well below the last three years of 8% plus growth.  Our pricing initiatives are more challenging in this segment due to the soft economy, and profitability in the first half of the year is expected to be lower, due to higher costs materials flowing through our business. However, we currently expect the stronger second half as these costs pressures mitigate. Now, in light of the current environment, we put on hold our various projects in Poland, India and other growth areas, but are prepared to restart them should market conditions warrant.  Given the challenging environment in our core markets, our European management team stands ready to adjust to any deviations from our expectation. Our food and household products group continues to perform well and remains on track versus our expectations. Excellent progress in our rationalization program, tight discipline around our pricing and cost recovery initiatives, and overall attention to detail and focused execution are all contributing to strong performance.  Core volumes for the quarter were up in the mid-single digits, and generally in line with industry volumes. Longer and stronger than normal seasonal pack in several region and significant promotional activity by some of our customers were partly offset by lower segment volumes. Aerosol volumes continue to improve from the late summer.  As many of you know, we faced significant tin plate increases in this business for 2009, and we have no choice but to pass these costs on. Currently, we're on plan and on track with these cost recovery initiatives. As we go into 2009, we see limited evidence of demand destruction resulting from these increases, but it is early in the year. Despite this, we expect our food and household products division to have a very strong year as we finalize our rationalization program and prepare to take the next step in terms of maximizing profitability and generating acceptable returns.  Plastic Packaging Americas had a challenging fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower volumes in the CSD and water segments. Overall volumes were down in the low teens and we took a significant amount of downtime in the fourth quarter to manage to inventory targets. With regard to our various contract negotiations, we have reached agreement with all of our customers and are in the process of finalizing these contracts.  While the various terms are in line with our expectations, we expect continued market softness in this segment and, as a result, we are considering a variety of measures to maximize profitability and value in the short- and long-term. We do expect profitability in the segment to be up year-over-year.  Our aerospace business had another strong quarter, with sales and EBIT both above expectations in the fourth quarter of 2007. This excellent performance was achieved despite a tough market caused, in large part, by a lack of funding and decision making by the US government. While our antenna components and services businesses are maintaining solid growth, our traditional space hardware business has slowed. Management is aggressively addressing the issue of right sizing the business, while rebuilding the backlog to position this business for growth in the future.  So, overall, we are pleased with operational performance of our company. Our continued emphasis on being close to the customer, balancing our supply and demand, and relentless focus on execution on the things that allow us to excel should position ourselves for a strong 2009. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David Hoover: Well thank you, John, and thanks to you, Ray, for your comments. These are challenging times, but we're managing our businesses prudently through this environment. We took disciplined actions where needed in 2008. Our products and services provide value to our customers and have historically been defensive in economic downturns, and our balance sheet is strong, with no significant debt repayment obligations until the fourth quarter of 2011.  We have confidence in our strategy and our competitive position. We're managing Ball for long-term growth to continue to deliver value to our customers and to create value for our shareholders. And with that, Elainea, we're ready for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions.) Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Wachovia.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Hey, guys. Good morning.
David Hoover: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Hoping you can give us more color, John, on the volume outlook for Europe in the low single digits for '09. What gives us comfort on that and how does that compare on a reasonable basis, Western Europe versus Eastern Europe? Thanks.
John Hayes: Your last part of the question is, I think, the most important part. We have seen a significant slowdown in the east generally, whether you're talking about Poland, Russia, Ukraine, all the region in there, and so that's one of the main reason why we slowed down our Lublin project.  In the west, whether it's in the UK or France, and even to an extent in Germany, we are seeing volumes hold up on a relative basis. Given the continued trends we see going from two-way packaging to one-way packaging, that does favor the can, and while we don't expect a significant amount of growth, nor are we anticipating it. Currently, we think, in some of those western countries, we will see modest growth.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Okay. And just as a measure of clarification, the $23.2 million of operating profit in metal household, that includes the $6.8 million claim? Right?
John Hayes: Correct. 
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning, gentlemen.
David Hoover: Good morning.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: A couple of questions for you. First, Ray, a question on your free cash assumptions for 2009. Help me with some of the buckets here. If you're starting, let's say, I think at 321 base from '08, looking forward to '09, you're not going to have, I think, a mill payment recurring.  You talked about pension possibly being up a little bit, but it sounds like your CapEx down by greater than that amount. It sounds to me as though that could be a bit conservative. Are there some other pieces, potentially working capital or restructuring cash that we may be missing to help us with the rest of the puzzle?
Raymond Seabrook: Yes. Remember, the pension expense and the cash contributions are different numbers, so what I said was the expense running through our P&L is only up slightly. That will be up a couple million dollars probably in the neighborhood. We had expenses this year, probably our P&L and pension expense in 2008 probably around $69 or $70 million.  I'm looking for probably in the neighborhood of $72 million next year. And that's a noncash item. Then you go over to the cash side, and because of the broad decline in the stock markets, we're going to have to put more cash in our pension plans and mainly in the US, because the general plans are unfunded.  That amount that we sort of -- as I see here today, I expect that number to be in the neighborhood of $40 million. Call it $25 million after tax. So, we put in around the same as we expensed last year. We put in $72, $73 million; we'll probably put in the neighborhood of $108 million next year into our pension plans, which will get us close to being 80% funded in the US.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thanks.
Raymond Seabrook: And you probably got an edge build in working capital as well. So, if you take those things into account and a little conservatism, you'll get through 375.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Master from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Master - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning.
David Hoover: Good morning.
Mark Master - JPMorgan: I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the price mix in Europe. It was down for the quarter. I think last quarter it was maybe some specialty can there. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color.
John Hayes: Yes. Unlike the US, Europe has a much broader mix of can sizes, anything from 33 centiliter to 50 centiliter. The specialty ones you are referring to are 250 ml and everything in between. We saw more of a gravitation towards more of the commodity smaller sizes towards 33 cl, which effectively was the mix that I was talking about.
Mark Master - JPMorgan: Okay. Is that something that's happening in North America, as well, in terms of specialty cans? How are those holding up in North America?
John Hayes: Those are holding up relatively well, because when you look at end markets and you look at energy drinks, for example. Energy drink, I think is the only drink category in the US that is up in 2008. It was up based on the information we have about 7%. All the other various end markets were in decline and, as you know, the specialty market really is driven by the energy drink side.
Mark Master - JPMorgan: Okay. Good, thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions.) And our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick question, I think you mentioned in your presentation about pricing in Europe maybe not being as favorable as you might like in the first half with the weak market demand. But, with the overall supply and demand situation being pretty solid still, I guess the question is what would be driving that lack of better pricing power?
John Hayes: Well, it's not as if we haven't been trying to get price in the marketplace and it isn't as if we haven't been successful. We have been successful. It's just as we started into our pricing discussions last fall, remember the deflation had not occurred and, so, as we are going through those negotiations, and the additional capacity that has been brought on stream, it did create a little bit of issue in terms of trying to get pricing as we move through the balance of 2008.  And so it's not a big issue, but it is certainly an issue that we didn't get as much as our expectations. Now, the other thing going on in Europe, as you know, we have both aluminum and steel. We all know what's going on in the steel, so we have a high amount of high-cost inventory, if you will, sitting in steel in the first half of this year. And that's what I was referring to, that the first half maybe lower than this time last year, largely due to price cost issues. But, as we work that through and we expect that some of these commodity prices will continue to come down as the year goes on, we expect we will be able to make that up. 
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks. Then one quick follow-up, Ray, or just to clarify anyway if you mentioned this already, sorry if I missed it, but with the inventory at $11.5 million that you took with the hedging on -- I think you said that was going to show up in '09. Could you give us an idea of what the actual timing is, whether that will be in the first quarter mostly or over the course of the year?
Raymond Seabrook: Well, yes. Unfortunately, there are derivatives products that now we're going to have market-to-market. Those products you all have watched yourself through our system that will be totally out by the third quarter. So, by the end the third quarter we will through undistributed cost have picked up $11.5 million of additional earnings.  I can't tell you by quarter. It depends on the price of aluminum, but, fundamentally, there can be no economic loss to this thing. It's an accounting item, it's not really economics. We will pick up 11.5 somewhere between the first and the third quarter of next year.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Khoshaba from KSA Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Good morning, guys.
Raymond Seabrook: Good morning.
John Hayes: Hi, Dan.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Hi, I joined just a little bit late, so I'm going to ask a couple of very quick questions. I apologize if they've already been asked or if you've talked about these items. First of all, in the food can and aerosol can business, which you showed a very nice improvement year-over-year in, how much of the pricing initiative in Q1 was actually in place for the full quarter? And also, I know you've been restructuring that business to take cost out. Where are you in that process as well?
John Hayes: Yeah, I think if I understood your question on the pricing, Dan. In the fourth quarter, none of our 2009 pricing initiatives were in the fourth quarter 2008.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Okay, all right. So did you, you did put some pricing in for Q1 though, correct?
John Hayes: Yes, absolutely. As I mentioned, we've had unprecedented steel price increases and we've had no choice but to pass those on.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Okay, good. And how do you feel about the success of that initiative? You feel like you've gotten the pricing improved?
John Hayes: Yes. I think in my comments, I said we're on track and on target.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Okay, good. On the second item, just real quick, is the restructuring structuring activity that you began, I guess it was over a year ago now, in the food can -- aerosol food can business after the purchase of US Can. Are there still activities taking place there?
John Hayes: That is, we're on track with that as well, and so as we move into 2009, we expect to get approximately $15 million of cost savings in that business and we have other initiatives that we're taking, going to the next step in terms of continuing to try and improve that business. The management team of that business is doing a very good job.
David Hoover: The improvement, Dan, not all priced. A lot of it is related to taking out costs and running better.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Right. Okay, great. So, that's going to be an area that's going to do well in 2009. You are certainly counting on it to do reasonably well in '09 for you?
John Hayes: Yes, that's our expectation.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Last question, if I – well, two more real quick ones, if I could? The plastics business was break even. I don't know if you addressed this in your commentary. Resin prices have fallen. Are you expecting better performance in that business, or is it just too tough of an outlook for that business?
David Hoover: We said we expect profitability to be up, but the pain problem is related to demand being soft right now. But we're adjusting as we go forward and we'll continue to do that.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Okay. Free cash flow, pay down debt, I guess. You're not going to buy back stock?
Raymond Seabrook: Yeah, initially, these capital markets are really a scary thing right now. We don't have any refinancing until October 2011, and so we just really want to flow some cash and we'll see how the markets are.  If the markets come back, then we'll feel more comfortable and we may start buying our stock. If we get a great price, so we may start buying it, but right now, our number one priority is to deliver and flow some cash, and then we will see how the capital market looks.
Dan Khoshaba - KSA Capital: Okay. Well, good job, guys. Thanks.
John Hayes: Thanks, Dan.
Operator:

Michael Sheridan - Cobalt: Hi, guys, good morning. Could you just help me understand the pass through steel? How much of a pass through do you need, pricing wise, to recover your steel inflation for the year?
John Hayes: Well, to be honest, we don't talk about those things publicly, but, as I said, the pricing increase in steel has been significant. So we are passing that through, but--
Michael Sheridan - Cobalt: If I think about steel content as a percent of cost of a can, maybe that's the best way for me to look at it. Can you just help me understand how much steel content, as far as cost of goods sold, is contained in a can?
John Hayes: Again, it depends upon the size of the can. A big can has more steel on a relative basis than a small can.
Raymond Seabrook: But, generally, it's more than half.
Michael Sheridan - Cobalt: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kian Martin from Singer. Please proceed with your question.
Kian Martin: Morning, gentlemen. I wonder if you could provide just a bit more background on your comments on Russia. I think obviously the growth in the market started to slow during the third quarter. I was just wondering whether you could provide some figures for what the market has delivered you in the fourth quarter.
John Hayes: Well, as you probably know, we currently are not in Russia. We have a very small amount of export, but I use that as an example just to say in Russia, in all of the east, including Russia, that in the fourth quarter there are actually declines in volume in the fourth quarter in Russia and other parts of the east.
Kian Martin: Okay. And then, just moving onto your comments on specialty cans. Would it be possible for you to breakout the high single digit growth that you saw in European volumes between the standard 12 ounce cans and specialty?
John Hayes: I don't have that in front of me, but the majority of the growth, I believe, came from the 33 centiliter can.
Kian Martin: Okay. Is it true to say that the specialty can is still growing, or has that slipped into year-on-year negative?
John Hayes: No. I know it certainly does continue to grow.
Kian Martin: Okay. That's great, thank you very much for your time.
John Hayes: You bet.
Operator: (Operator Instructions.) We have a follow-up question from Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes, this is Chris Manuel from KeyBanc. Two quick follow-ups for you. One is, when you think about your position versus the competitive landscape both in North America and Europe -- you talked a little bit about taking some down time, so that your inventories were in the correct position.  As you look across or to the extent you can see what competitors are doing or what you think they're doing, I should say, is your anticipation that the supply/demand is reasonably in balance, and that there's not a large inventory overhang that needs to be worked through?
John Hayes: Well, we can't really comment on what our competitors do or don't do, but if you've been watching plant closures across the industries and so on, my impression is that your assumption is probably right. I know it isn't in our case, but we better not talk about what our competitors do.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I think in North America, clearly we've seen that, but in Europe it's tougher to get a sense there. I want to see what opinion you've got as to whether you think that inventory levels are reasonable there or not.
John Hayes: Again, as Dave said, we can only look at our business. Our inventory levels are reasonable going into 2009, and there's also structural impediments that don't allow a lot of inventory hangover, because you have to produce cans with the appropriate labels and, given the promotional activities using labels in Europe, it's not as if you can build a large stock of what I would call standard labels.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's helpful, actually. Second question I had was with respect to how you would – Ray, as you pointed out, the capital markets are in a bit of turmoil here, particularly on the debt side, but how you would think about acquisition market at this point in time? Your balance sheet's in pretty good shape and there is potential for some consolidation opportunities. I just -- a sense as to whether that's something you would be willing to consider or whether it's more of a batten down the hatches type of approach right now?
David Hoover: Well, I think, Chris, its Dave. I think the circumstances around this could well present opportunity for people like ourselves, as we look forward. Part of the reason to have a strong balance sheet and to strengthen a little bit more is just for that very thing when nothing in particular in mind, but I do believe that guys that were running around stapling eight times or ten times EBITDA financings suddenly have no money.  Our debt that has a ratio, I think, of under 7% or 7%, its due in 2018 traded above 9%, is now below 8%, again, on a market basis, indicating that that's what the market thinks. So if the cost of debt is higher, then you've got to look real hard if you're financing it with debt at any transaction that you do, but we wouldn't rule that out. And I think maybe prices for acquisitions, as we get through this period, are going to be a little more rational, but that's all I can say. It's all speculation.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you very much.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
David Hoover: Okay well, Elainea, thank you very much. You've done a great job with this call. Thank you, all of you, for listening to our conference call. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in April.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-30 11:00:00) =====

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 30, 2008. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Sara and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation’s conference call regarding our company’s third quarter 2008 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC fillings as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With me today on today's call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and CFO; and John Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Our overall performance in the quarter was very good. Although, one of our business segments reported improved profitability compared to the third quarter of 2007, despite the difficult economic environment. We have been taking actions to position the company for near-term and long-term and we have an excellent platform from which to do so. Now Ray and John will say more about that and provide some color on our financial and operations performance and then I will close with a few comments about our outlook. Ray.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter were at $1.13 and through the first nine months were at $3.03, up in the quarter and up through the first nine months compared to last year's record per share earnings. Where earnings and cash flow continued to show up our share price is trading at 8.5 times trailing 12 months comparable earnings, which is at a 20 year low for a business that we think is mostly recession resistant. To offset reduced US beverage can demand and strengthen our competitive position, earlier today we announced the closure of two beverage can plans. A plant in Kansas City which manufactured specialty beverage cans will be closed by the end of the first quarter of 2009 with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. Also a plant in Puerto Rico which manufactures 12 ounce beverage cans will be closed by the end of this year, with the manufacturing equipment redeployed internationally. An after tax charge of approximately 32 million will be recorded to reflect these plants closing, on which about 28 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter and 4 million will be booked to the first quarter of 2009. Inclusive of income tax benefit these closure are expect to be 9 million cash positive of a final disposition of the assets and cost reduction associated with the plant closing are expected to exceed $30 million in 2009. Turning to the operations third quarter comparative earnings were higher than a year ago in all business segments with the exception of plastics. The higher operating earnings and lower administrative and interest cost along with a lower share count or a share buyback were the key factors to higher third quarter comparable earning per share. Full year free cash flow is projected to be in the range of 275 to 300 million, which is accurately ducking the one time 70 million legal settlements paid in the first quarter. We also anticipate full year capital spending will be around 225 million with more than 50% of that spending being for new top line growth project. The targeted 2008, 300 million stock buyback program is progressing as planned and through the first three quarters we have purchased a net 258 million of stock and we continue to see outstanding value in our stock buyback program especially at these prices. During the quarter we try to get consent from our 2012 bond hold convent for what we consider a reasonable cost that would allow for more stock buyback commencing in 2009. We cannot get the consent at a reasonable cost, so the stock buyback program for 2009 will probably be in a $150 to $175 million with additional 2009 free cash flow being used for debt reduction to strengthen the company’s credit profile. Moving on to liquidity and the balance sheet, we expect to have over a half a billion dollar of committed credit available by December 31st and no major debt refinancing due until October 2011. We continue to posting monitor counter parties risk associated with our interest rate and commodity derivatives that are spread out to move these counter parties so the risk is not contemplated with only a few key financial institutions. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was at 2.55 billion down from 2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. We expect net balance sheet debt to be well below 2.2 billion at the year end due to a weaker euro and strong fourth quarter free cash flow. The rolling four quarters EBITDA interest coverage is at 4.5 times and total net debt to the rolling four quarters EBITDA is at 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter. With that, I will turn it over to John.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Ray. As David and Ray mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, especially given the macroeconomic environment. Our continued focus on execution coupled with taking necessary actions around pricing and capacity decisions in many of our businesses positions Ball well for 2009 and beyond. Our 2008 activities have been focused on getting ourselves well positioned for the future. We have a very strong platform and the correct strategy. Our emphasis is on executing better, harder, faster and smarter. We are making good progress in cost recoveries for our pricing initiatives, optimizing and controlling our costs in each business, delivering value through our new product developments efforts, becoming a leader in sustainability and putting in place some more robust process around supply chain in risk management. As I have said we made good progress, but more needs to be done. Regarding being proactive around balancing our supply with our demand Ray mentioned the closing of our two beverage can plants in North America, Kansas City and Puerto Rico. These actions combined with our previously announced rationalization activities and our regular continuous improvement programs result in a reduction of approximately 1100 or 7% of our worldwide positions over the past year. While closing facilities is something we never welcomed, we believe it is necessary to ensure that we remain economically sustainable and fit for the future. When combined with our other plant closures this year in North America, however, these plant closures are examples of just how determined we are to monitor supply and demand relative to our current and expected future sales and production requirements and to get paid for the value we and our products deliver. As we finish out the year, we are focused on ensuring that our inventories are properly aligned relative to our needs going forward and we will curtain product as required to meet our cash flow objectives. Now given the changing dynamics in each of our packaging businesses, it is critical that we transition to a more demand driven business model. We are focused on the full active around balancing our supply base with the demand required by the marketplace as well as leveraging our innovation with those customers seeking differentiation. Examples of progress in our innovations efforts include our continued growth and our overall specialty packaging volume, reaching roughly 7 billion units this year with year-to-date with the forecast to hit over 9 billion units for this year across all of our business. In addition, exciting 2008 success stories around innovation including more than 20 new products launched this year such as our new products 16-ounce Alumi-Tek bottle for a major North American beer customer and our reclosable beverage being utilized by major energy drink in Europe. All totaled, we expect more than 4 billion new unit markets across our packaging product lines to hit retail shelves this year, something we believe differentiates Ball as a supplier and positions us nicely with brand owners for both the short and long-term as they seek to enhance their sales and profits. Now moving to Metal Beverage Americas; profitability for the quarter was above expectations and above 2007 comparable levels by nearly 5% despite volumes for the quarter being down about 6%. Ball's volumes were off a bit more than the industry due largely to walking away from unprofitable volume for both beer and some selected CSD supply locations at the end of last year. We also experienced lower volumes due to seizing production at our Kent plant in the third quarter. Driving this improved profitability was excellent cost optimization in all of our plants and a rigorous focus on cost containment through the rest of the business. Even with the broader economic slowdown and the impact on high fuel prices on C-store volumes, there are bright spots in the beverage market with industry beer can volumes being up approximately 1% year-to-date and energy drinks, teas, and [iced tonics] also growing albeit at a slower rate. Ball is more leveraged towards the beer and specialty can markets in North America and we expect to continue to capitalize on these trends going forward. In terms of the commercial side, over the next 15 months, we have a variety of contracts that are coming up for renewal. We do not believe that we are getting sufficient economic returns on these contracts and discussions continue regarding these renegotiations. In China our volumes were up nearly 20% in the quarter and are up over 15% year-to-date. A key driver for the volume growth is our very strong customer mix, where we are leveraged more towards the beer and tea markets, both of which are seeing strong growth while the CSD market has softened a bit since the summer Olympics concluded. In our European operations, volumes grew approximately 5% in the third quarter, mainly driven by strong growth in the UK, Benelux and Southeast Europe. This growth was partially offset by poor weather conditions in Poland, France, Germany, and Spain during the summer season. For the year we are up roughly 8%, which is consistent with overall industry growth. Earnings in Europe were up year-over-year due largely to higher volumes and foreign exchange with higher costs partially offsetting these improvements. With the increase in cost experienced over the past year our European management team is focused on pricing initiatives as we begin with 2009 negotiations season as well as on cost optimization in this business. Back in July we also stated that we are monitoring regional economies closely and we will adjust our capital investment timing depending on market conditions. For this reason in the third quarter we elected to slowdown our project in India due to near term higher inflation and a more reserved demand outlook in that country. However, our Brazilian joint ventures continuing with its plans for new facility outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil continues to see strong consumer demand for cans. Turning to metal food and household products, we remain on track to improve this business. Our pricing initiatives, cost control plans, and favorable product mix added to another solid quarter. As reported in our second quarter 10-Q, during the third quarter, our aerosol business experienced a tin plate supply issue. A supplier failed to deliver committed metal. While this matter affected a limited seasonal part of our product mix, it caused supply disruption with some of our customers that resulted in loss sales and profitability in the quarter. Any disruption to our customers is unacceptable. Ball has made every effort to fulfill our customers' requests and minimize the impact on our customer base. Today Ball is receiving a necessary tin plate to produce products for our customers and we are working through the remaining production issues caused by the steels shortage. While year-to-date industry volumes are down mid-single digits, for the quarter Ball experienced slight volume growth driven by favorable food and aerosol can demand. We continue to expect full year volumes to remain consistent with our expectations. Performance in this business is progressing as we expected and the previously announced rationalization program continues to be on schedule and should deliver at least 15 million of cost savings in 2009. Customers are being notified of the steep steel price hikes anticipated on January 1, 2009 in our need to recover these and other costs as they are incurred. We are confident we are well positioned to continue our progress in this business. Plastic Packaging Americas results are slightly behind last year before the costs associated with plant closures and remain economically unsustainable. Overall volumes for our plastic business were down more than 13%. However, a bright spot in this was a 6% increase in our custom PET container volumes, further validating our strategy to grow this segment in a measured way. Within 25% of our total volume now coming from custom containers and with our contract renegotiations for 2009 nearly finalized, we believe we are well positioned for meaningful improvement in profitability in next year and beyond. Ball aerospace had another strong quarter, building on what will be a very strong year. Excellent program execution is driving much of the improved performance and we continued to be focused on building our backlog, which has declined to 672 million during this difficult transitional period for the US Federal Government. While we expect to gain more visibility on the 2009 outlook after the presidential election, one significant new booking in the quarter was the award of the Orion Navigation Sensor Suite, which represents our first major work content in this emerging human space exploration market, an important area of new business opportunity. As in all of our businesses, we have plans in place of BATC to closely monitor our future demand and make adjustments to our cost base as necessary. So in summary, the combination of solid and improving performance from our operations and aggressive actions to transition our business to a more disciplined demand driven focused are positioning Ball for a strong 2009. And with that I will turn it back to Dave.
David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John, and thank you, Ray. On a business by business basis, we're improving performance, adjusting our manufacturing footprint focusing clearly on execution. Since John Hayes became our Chief Operating Officer back in January, we've taken deep dives into each of our businesses and in the company as a whole to look at our future strategic direction. We believe our strategy to grow our worldwide beverage can business and aerospace business improve our food and household and plastics businesses and to generate substantial free cash flow and use it to return value to our shareholders is correct and our focus is on execution of that strategy. In many ways, today's environment plays into Ball's strengths. Operational excellence, relentless attention to detail, commitment to customer focus, creating value added innovation, and empowering our employees to think and act like owners. If we execute the way I think we can, I expect to improved results in 2009. As all of you know, today's broader economic environment is truly unusual, something I haven't seen in nearly 40 years in business. But I like where we are as a company and I'm bullish about our future. With that Sara, I think we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Good morning. A few questions. First of all, quickly, the Kent City facility, I remember that being one of the original Reynolds custom facilities, it might have been the first one. Realizing that you're managing supply to demand does the shutdown here reflect at all any moderation in growth or plans within the custom can market Dave or John?
David Hoover: No, not really. John, why don't you answer that.
John Hayes: Not really. We have seen a slowdown, but that has historically been a high cost plant. And as we are trying to get fit to the future what we are trying to do is maximize the output of our low cost facilities and it's nothing more than that. We still have high aspirations for the custom can market, trying to take a leadership position in that. A lot of our new products revolve around custom containers and so this is not a backward step at all in terms of our commitment to the custom market.
George Staphos: John, on the non-playing unit that you mentioned, how much of that is actually can?
John Hayes: Good question. It is the majority of it. I don't have the numbers off the top of my head. But I would say approximately 75%. But I'd be certainly happy to get back to you on that.
George Staphos: Okay. I appreciate it John. As far as template goes and realizing now that you are in a process of adjusting for and smoothing out any supply issues that you might have had earlier in the quarter, do you anticipate that disruption leads to any volume loss in 2009? Or do you think your customer relationships remain solid for those customers that were affected?
John Hayes: Well in trying times, it always puts strains on customer relations. And we're trying to make sure that we're doing as much as we humanly can to make sure any impact is minimized with our customer base. So as we go into 2009, you know, it's too early to tell or to see. But we think a lot of our key strategies about being closer to customer should help us in this. But it has been a challenging time for our food and household products group.
George Staphos: Have you announced the general increase here for food and household for next year guys? Thanks. I will turn it over after that.
John Hayes: We have both orally and in writing having communications with our customers. We are in the midst of finalizing our metal pricing in the coming days and once that is finalized, we plan to formerly communicate the specific of price increases to our customers.
George Staphos: Okay, thanks. I will turn over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Wachovia. Please proceed with your questions.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi guys, good morning.
John Hayes: Good morning.
David Hoover: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: John, could you touch on volume trajectories in Europe during the quarter with September meaningfully weaker than the prior two months? And also how should we think about 2009 for Europe, you know, should we be thinking volumes in the low single digits and maybe a little help from pricing?
John Hayes: Yeah, let me take your first question. If you recall in the second quarter conference call, I said July stood up very strong and it was double-digits in the month of July. It started to slowdown and effectively we saw near flat volumes in the month of September. We have seen a little bit of rebound in October low to mid single digits. And so you never know, you can't look month by month because these things -- there is aberrations within various month. But there has been a slowdown, if not significant or material slowdown. As we look to 2009, recall that we had always talked about from a planning perspective, we always assume mid single digits growth. And we see nothing that that fundamentally changes, we are just not going to see the strong double-digit growth that we have been afforded and awarded over the past couple of years.
Ghansham Panjabi: And on pricing in Europe for '09?
John Hayes: Well, we are right in the very beginning of pricing discussions, despite some of the things coming off recently they are still well above historical norms. And so we are going out and as I said in my prepared comments that our management over there is very focused on maximizing the price opportunity, but it’s like every time its challenging out there, but they are very focused on that.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Claudia Hueston with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Claudia Hueston: Thanks very much. Just first on the European business, I think last quarter you talked a little bit about transportation issues that had affected the quarter. Can you just comment on that situation now and how it was in the third quarter?
John Hayes: That's largely over. You recall that we said a major customer of ours on the continent had a strike and it created all sorts of disruption in the supply chain. But that was really more a second quarter event. There's a little bit in the third quarter, but it's not worth talking about it.
Claudia Hueston: Perfect. Thank you. And then just on the metal, food and household business, just on the [tin plates], I just want to be clear, so the supply issues with import are pretty much over now and you have the supply that you need? Is that right? And then if it's possible to quantify the impact that it had on the third quarter that would be helpful as well?
John Hayes: Yeah, we are receiving tin plates that not the issue, but what it is getting to the appropriate line time for the specific sizes, because as you know, our lines can make different things. And so we still have a bubble if you will from a production point of view. But we're working our way through that as we speak right now. And I'm sorry, your second question was?
Claudia Hueston: If you could just quantify, the impact of the tin plate on the third quarter?
John Hayes: We are still in the midst of it, it did cost us some both loss sales and profits. I don’t want to get in any specifics right now, because its still ongoing, but it certainly did cost us some money.
Claudia Hueston: Okay, thanks.
John Hayes: Again remember, this is small part of just a portion of the food and household products group, so……
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Thein: Thank you. Two questions, first John, I was curious, if you could, you had shared some outlooks in the past in terms of what your expectations were for Germany in terms of domestic fillings. Where do you think that can be given the economic change in the environment, let's say in a year or two. I don’t know if you've changed your view on that. And the second question was just more broadly speaking, if commodities continue to come in, in the past the CSD and brewers have been a little bit more aggressive, I think this year they raised prices north of CPI, which they had done a while. If that reverses and I understand it takes some time to trickle through, but would you think if anything that that means in terms of can makers as potentially that your customers push a little bit harder on volume over price.
John Hayes: First in Germany, in fact we were there last week. And there is some positive signs coming out of the German market and there are two specific examples I will give you. A major soft drink customer starting to promote the can, actively promote the can. They're selling six packs for the price of five. That is from my knowledge the first real promotional activity in a major way by a major customer in Germany. The second is that some of the discounters have had discussions about reintroducing the can which they haven’t yet due to this returnable system. They are talking about reintroducing cans for beer which is another good sign. Now that nothing has happened there. But as you're question asked what does it looked like a year to two years. As you recall, I always talked about this being a marathon, not a Sprint. And its going to take a while, you know, I always look back to Denmark when they put in the deposit system it really took about five or six years. So meaningful improvement and logarithmic growth, if you will, and so, we hope some of this activity by both the soft drinks companies and the beer and the retailers will be helpful in the long-term. As your second question about commodities coming off and promotion activity of our customers, they have put price increases to review, you all can look in the public form of what was going on in terms of soft drinks in North America. It's challenging time for them and they are looking at a wide variety of SKUs and proliferation of SKUs to get their volume growing. I think its always helpful, not only as commodities comedown, but also in a more challenging economic environment where people stay home more, our product are for the home consumption market and I think that does play, could play favorably, and this is what we are talking about balancing supply and demand not only at current, but also the future. And as we go through and look at these capacity rationalizations we stress our system to look at their scenarios about volumes going down, volumes going up and making sure that we are in the right spot at the right time.
Timothy Thein: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Wilde: Good morning. I have a question for Ray, I wondered Ray if you could just help us think about kind of perspective impact for FX in Q4 and in `09?
Raymond Seabrook:  You are talking more on the translation of our four earnings.
Mark Wilde: Right yeah.
Raymond Seabrook: Well, you know, year-to-date its $0.17. Okay, there is about a nickel in the third quarter. And I think depending on where the exchange rate is next year. We have a 100% of our next years first quarter earnings hedged and we have about 50% of the second two quarter hedge, and we have those hedges at a rate of 150 euros for the first quarter, but 147 for the other two. So we have an impact, it will always be lower, it all depend on what the rate is, but through the first three quarter you’ve had $0.17, if you will compared to the year before. And it will be lower, but we have some of those, we said some of the impact hedged.
Mark Wilde:  Okay. What about just sort of outside of the euros and impact in other areas. As you mentioned Brazil has been a big move?
Raymond Seabrook:  You know, Brazil is equity accounting, Brazil has very little impact and Canada has very little impact. When you look at operations, it's primarily coming from China and Europe. China, the currency generally hasn’t moved too much. So, when we were to look at our foreign currency impact it really, mainly all coming from Europe. We do have Canada impact, and we do have some China impact, but they are very, very small.
Mark Wilde:  Okay, that’s the answer I was looking for. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Naya with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
Joseph Naya: Good morning. Yeah, just curious, looking at (inaudible)?
David Hoover: Excuse me. We are having real trouble hearing you.
Joseph Naya: Yeah, just was curious, looking at your results for a last couple of quarters, you had some pretty strong volume growth coming from Asia, we’re just wondering kind of what you are thinking going forward about that if that, -- you have a bump there related to the Olympics or you expect that sort of growth to continue?
David Hoover: I think there was a bump in the Olympic, I think we when commented on soft drink side, but what we see, well, I think the trend will continue be certainly on the beer and teas and other kinds of things, there is a fair amount of growth where we are leveraged a little bit more like we are really in all of our business to that side of the business. You know, you tell me what the impact of the people in the worlds economy, its going to have on-demand everywhere. But I think, I would think in `09 we wont see that kind of growth we did in 2009 which got the lift from the Olympics are probably a better economics, but I expect those still be growth there. John, do you help me on that.
John Hayes: I think some of the macro trends in China do pretend well for the growth of the beverage can, we have the rise in the middle class and going from the rural areas to the urban areas which is very important. At the same time you are seeing finally the consolidation on the beer side. And then thirdly, and as a percent of package mix is still in the range of 3 to 4%, I mean, it’s a little by any comparison of virtually any country in the world. So combined with those first two macroeconomic events and with the little can penetration we thin there is room for upward growth there.
Joseph Naya: Okay. And you mentioned that your project and you've kind of scaled that back or slowed it down. Do you have kind of any idea or any thoughts as to when that might be going live?
John Hayes:  Well, we have put out some dates, but I think in this current economic environment, it would be premature to do that. We do over the long-term think there's a good can market in India. But their economy has slowed down particularly even before this credit crisis started hitting, because they are a net importer of commodities. And as the commodity price increases went through, inflation started going through very strong, which put a damper on the middle class, which hurts can demand. So whether it's a year whether its two years, I can't tell you. But we are paying very close attention to not only India, but the other parts of the world as well.
Joseph Naya:  So the project is pretty well on hold at this point?
John Hayes: That's correct.
Joseph Naya:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel:  Good morning gentlemen.
David Hoover:  Good morning.
Chris Manuel:  Congratulations on a great quarter. A couple questions for you. First Ray, could you help us bucket with what CapEx may look like for 2009. I know it's bounced around a little bit over last few years, but just where you're thinking today.
Raymond Seabrook:  Well you know, I'm going to answer and then turn it to John. We've been telling to you fairly consistently that it will be kind of in the 350 range and we still have a lot of stuff to do. As John talked about some of these things were kind of pushing, result of this is everything is slowing down, we are kind of push above little bit. And so as we currently see we're really working on our budgets and plans. But we think probably we'll spend less in depreciation right now. We haven’t got a number, but John, do you want to add anything to that?
John Hayes: The only thing I would say is we are taking a fresh look at every one of our projects in light of the current economic situation. And we're prepared to slow down or stop some movement if required, if we don't think the demand is there. (Multiple Speaker). Probably on the high end as we said today.
Raymond Seabrook:  Depreciation is 300. So we said less than depreciation. So that should get you in a ballpark.
Chris Manuel: And then I will ask you a second question is SG&A was down a lot this quarter compared to where it was the first couple of quarters. Can you maybe help us….?
Raymond Seabrook: Yeah. A lot of that -- we do have this thing in our deferred comp plans, we have these mark to market on our stock price. And our stock price goes down, that impacts our deferred comp plans and it also runs through our P&L. So you got 4 to 5 million of that stuff in there and you've also got our aerospace business. You saw the continued strong profits in aerospace. And the year before, we had a lot of bid and proposal cost work that we were working on it. We haven’t had as much of that. And so the SG&A is down. So as those are the two major items that’s causing that. And then if look for the full year, its also down and we also had less R&D expense and primarily a lot of that’s is coming from aerospace as well. We do a lot of R&D in aerospace and we've had less of that. So those are the primary drivers.
Chris Manuel:  Two piece if you get and that's probably and/or so of the differential?
Raymond Seabrook: That's pretty much most of it, between aerospace and deferred comp and I see accruals, that's pretty much all of it.
Chris Manuel: That's helpful. And then the next question I had was, as you're looking at the contracts, Mr. Hayes, I think you talked to us about having some coming up in 2009, 2010. Could you may be help us bucket -- I don't know, percent of your North American portfolio that are coming due in '09 and' 10. Just so that we can get a sense of the magnitude of what's being renegotiated?
John Hayes: Yeah, when I tell you was over the next 15 months -- just give me a second, I want to be clear here. Approximately 40 to 50% of our contracts coming up for renewal and as I said, I stick by what I said in the prepared remarks that we were focused on making sure we're doing those things in the right way.
Chris Manuel:  Okay. And are the bulk of those 2010 events or they are more then that will be setting up for '09? Can you give us a little granularity?
John Hayes:  It is more weighted closer of 15 months out than it is 3 months out.
Chris Manuel:  Okay. That’s very helpful. I will jump back in queue.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Skidmore:  Thank you. Good morning. Just to follow up a little bit on the contract. Specifically, in plastic do you expect to have that contract done by the end of the year, or does that something that gets pushed into 2009?
John Hayes:  No, that's our current expectation.
Richard Skidmore: Okay. So the benefit really shows up in the first quarter of '09?
John Hayes: Yes.
Richard Skidmore: Okay. And then just to talk quickly about the supply to matching supply with demand in beverage cans in North America, what's the current assumption that you have for beverage can demand in North America, which driving the capacity closures today. And as you look at or do you think that you've closed sufficient capacity? Or do you expect there might be some more to come?
John Hayes: Your first question about can demand. Yeah it's very difficult to predict right now, because the soft economy plays into the favor of the can and the soft drink and beer companies needing to push volume. And the can is a wonderful package with which to do that. I think these are cost approval bit of a damper in terms of them having to pass costs onto the consumers, which is softened a little bit. But we remain relatively constructive about the beverage can volume over the next call it eighteen months or so. We don't expect a huge material decrease. But we do have plans contingency plans, if that happens in various scenarios on what we would do. We feel pretty good about where we sit right now in terms of the supply and demand as we see going forward.
Richard Skidmore: Thank you.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we do have a follow up question from the line of George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.
George Staphos: Thanks, hi guys. You mentioned that with your food can customers with household customers that you had orally and in writing begun to notify them on what pricing might look like perhaps at paraphrase [poll], but that was the substance what I thought I heard. Have you done the same thing where it's relevant for your beverage can customers for 2009?
John Hayes: Yes.
George Staphos: Okay. And realizing that you can't get into the tone of the negotiations at this juncture and that’s going to take the next 15 months or so. Would you say that the customers have been more understanding than perhaps in past years of your need to recover costs and returns and whatever other color you could provide around that, I would be appreciated?
David Hoover: George, I don't think that it's a matter of understanding or you know state of mind or whatever. What we've got to do is run our business and figure out what kind of a return we have to have to be a viable enterprise. And that's how we're addressing this. And we are professional about it as are our customers. We don't get price because we're nice. We basically have a business to run and they do too. So I'm optimistic with all the steps that we've been taking in terms of what's been referred to as our footprints and so on and so forth. And being realistic rational communicating constantly about what's going on. We're in these discussions all the time. And you know, on the one hand we have to be competitive and on the on the other hand we have to get a returns. I'm optimistic that we're going to be moving forward in a positive way and continue to make good returns and create value for share holders.
George Staphos: Okay, I appreciate that Dave. And turning to beverage can plants, I wouldn't suggest that you're just nice either. Could you (Multiple Speakers) after dealing with it, for the last 20 years. What affect should we expect from PPI adjusters in North America for next year can you quantify that for us at all?
David Hoover: Not off the top of my head. We have that, but I'd prefer not to talk about it right now. You know, in part because think about this three months ago we were talking about hyper inflation. And now people are talking about deflation. And those have material impacts on these PPI indices. And then how it translates into the timing of the PPI index, whether it's year-over-year, whether its third quarter over third quarter, year-over-year, there's a wide variety of mechanisms. So it’s changing quite rapidly as we speak.
George Staphos: Sorry Dave, go ahead.
David Hoover: I just consider real task right now is just to stay on top of this stuff as we are. Meaning, as things move and so forth and to be in close communication with customers we tend -- not tend. We don't want to take risks on the big commodities. And we don't, but we have to stay alert, alive, and we work very closely as we do with our customer on those things. Generally, I think if you think about our business that’s the way we describe is being recession resistant with commodities coming the other direction may be gives us the chance to catch up a little bit. But we are taking nothing for granted in this environment.
George Staphos: One last question on that and one on aerospace, I will turn it over. Can you remind me, are most of the PPI adjusters done on a weighted average basis year-on-year or are they point to point? And then in aerospace, was this contract that you talked about one of the ones that you had hope to receive this year one of the larger ones and what benefit might that give to your revenues and backlog going forward? Thanks guys.
John Hayes: Maybe I will take the PPI and Dave you can talk about aerospace. If I understand your question correctly, it is on a trailing 12 month basis. Does that answer your question?
George Staphos: I think so, I will handle it offline. And on aerospace?
David Hoover: This is not a huge contract. It’s a good contract in an area that’s new business for us, but it is not one of the couple of contract that we had alluded to, which are still sort of sliding until we get – there is sort of election going on, I think there is. And once that’s over we might be getting to get some more clarity, but it will take a little while.
George Staphos: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
David Hoover: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Alton Stump: Thank you. Good morning.
David Hoover: Good morning.
Raymond Seabrook: Good morning.
Alton Stump: (inaudible) quarter, just a quick question with European back end business, I think the way you’ve already answered a couple of times, what we can see next year in terms of volumes. Is there any difference right now between Eastern Europe and Western Europe in terms of the growth rate coming down a bit or are they both essentially acting inline with each other there?
David Hoover: Well, no. In fact and this is - it’s difficult to really look at it past couple of months because Eastern Europe has actually gone down a little bit more than relative basis than Western Europe. Now I will tell you first hand that they had no summer. And when I say no summer, it typically it’s sunny and 30 degree Celsius there, it was in the 15 degree Celsius and foreign rain for most of the summer because starting with the EuroCup Soccer and then going through August/September it was like that as well. But in talking with our customers in Eastern Europe, they didn’t believe this is an anomaly and they continue to believe that there is a good growth in that region generally. We have seen a slowdown, a greater slowdown in the east relative to the west, but again I think it’s more specific relative to certain events.
Alton Stump: Thank you. That’s all I have.
David Hoover: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Manuel: Good morning again. And for the record, David, I think you are nice guy.
David Hoover: Let’s (multiple speakers).
Chris Manuel: I am just kidding. A couple of things I wanted to follow up on. With the capacity coming out in Kansas City, is most of that – help us what I think is 1.1 billion unit is what you had indicated in the press release. Is most of that being redeployed into other plans or is that – what would be a net number coming out if you could help us?
David Hoover: That is what we are doing is that as we have a variety of plants that can make either standard or custom products. And what we are doing on the custom side of the business, looking at a rationalization opportunity to make sure that we are in low cost in that part of the business. And this is just an extenuation of that strategy.
John Hayes: Okay, the answer is all of it is [10 year system].
Chris Manuel: Okay. So it’s…
John Hayes: There wasn’t any volume, we relocated to other plant.
David Hoover: That is correct.
Chris Manuel: That’s helpful. And then the second question I had was – when you think about – you had an outstanding and this kind of follows up on some previous questions as well. You had an outstanding quarter in North American beverage or America/Asia beverage in particular. And if I think about how to bucket the roughly 10% operating earnings, could you help me do so? I am sure a portion of that’s the plant closure from Kent that’s beginning to gain traction, a portion of that’s going to be volume up in China, maybe some downside from volume down here. Can you help us bucket through what the major pieces were?
David Hoover: I think I tried to say in the prepared remarks, but in the North American portion of it, we closed it during the third quarter. But we've had excellent performance in our plants in terms of cost optimization as well as all non-plant costs. There's really been a very tight squeeze on that. When volumes are down 6% in that business and profits up 5% as I mention that just points to the excellent work that our manufacturing and other people have been doing. On the China side, certainly the volume growth has been a big part of it. If you think about those two issues right there, that makes up virtually all of the improvement.
Chris Manuel:  Okay. That’s helpful. And that’s all I had. Thank you.
David Hoover:  Thank you.
John Hayes: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Wilde:  I have just couple of followups. John, I think last year you had some December maintenance (inaudible) over in Europe. Is that going to be about the same this year? Or will there be a year-to-year change there?
John Hayes: No, I wouldn't expect a year to year change. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're cognizant of the environment we're working on we have our cash flow target. And if we have to take down even additional down time, make sure that we get our inventory is line which in Europe they generally are right now. If we have to do more, we're prepared to do that. I wouldn't expect to seat here any material deviation on down time this year versus the last year.
Mark Wilde: Okay. And then the other follow-up is the issue of the bottled water business. What's your sense of kind of volume in that business? And is the volume change significant enough that you may take some capacity out of the system there?
John Hayes:  Yes. I mean the bottled water business is a challenging market right now. In fact, I think what you are seeing is lot of consolidation on the -- I'll call it, not the tier one water companies but some of the tier two water companies, the private label companies things like that because it's very difficult to make money in that part of the business. We have seen materials slow down in that largely because of C-store, but also because of people are recognizing in a tough economy they don't need to be buying bottled water when they can use tap water. What that means in terms of our capacity, we're paying very close attention to it. We're converting a cold fill machines to hot fill machines as required to maintain that. And we are willing and prepared to take down time including with moth Balling certain lines if the demand does not show up in that part of the business.
David Hoover: It's obviously a big problem for our customers. I think what you're going to see and what we can see is they're working really hard to figure out how to restore some of this lost demand. The points that John made is king of a perfect storm summary. And high gas prices which area do not just water but also soft drink in the C-stores. And I'm not sure how big a deal the so called sustainability movement is. It's out there. My guess is it's not as big as others. The other thing is how this is marketed, where it's marketed, the sizes and other things. I mean there's a lot going on to try to figure out how to improve that. And certainly, we're pulling for our customers figuring this out, so we can sell more containers. But as John said in the event that we know, we got to have plans and we do.
Mark Wilde: Okay, very good. Thanks.
Operator:  (Operator Instruction).
David Hoover:  Okay, Sara, I don’t hear any more questions, and we are getting tired. So you've done great job on this call. I appreciate your help and everybody we'll talk to you again after the first of the year. I hope you have a good end of this year. I hope markets get a little better for all us. We are still here and doing pretty well.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-27 11:00:00) =====
Executives: R. David Hoover - Chairman President and CEO Raymond J. Seabrook - EVP and CFO John A. Hayes - EVP and COO

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 24th, 2008. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, CEO of the Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Tommy, and good morning everyone, and welcome to Ball's conference call regarding our second quarter results in 2008. I need to remind everyone the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements that actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC fillings as well as company new releases. And if you don't already have this earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com where you can also find information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, you will find those on our website as well. With me today on today's call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and CFO; and John Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. While I'm pleased with our operating performance in the second quarter and in the first half of 2008, in the first half of last year, 2007, we benefited from a few non-recurring items and still our company's results improved this year. Ray and John will say more about that and provide some color on our financial and operations performance, and then I'll close with a few comments about our outlook. Ray?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter were at $1.10 and through the first six months were at $1.90, up in the quarter and up through the first six months compared to last year's record per share earnings. To better understand our first half results, you really need to look at the earnings performance over the last two years, as Dave said. Normalized diluted first half earnings per share is up 53% for the two-year period, a 46% improvement in 2007 and a 7% improvement in 2008. Although we touched on this in our last call, it seems some investors were of the opinion that the 2007 per share earnings increase was not sustainable due to one-time operating gains made in 2007. Though the earnings mix has changed, our performance reflects the improvement was not only sustainable, but we have increased earnings per share through the first half of 2008, again off the record 2007 performance. Turning to the operations, lower second quarter beverage can earnings were somewhat offset by higher aerospace, food and household, and the [inaudible] equity earnings. Lower interest and tax expense and lower share count due to our share buyback program contributed to higher second quarter and year-to-date comparable earnings per share. Second quarter beverage can sales volumes remained strong in Europe and China with North American volumes down year-over-year through the first half. Lower second quarter worldwide beverage can earnings were anticipated coming off tough 2007 comps, but were up 30% from 2006 levels. Last year's second quarter beverage can earnings included $9 million of North American inventory metal gains and $17 million of European business interruption insurance not recurring in 2008. Both of these items were essentially finished in the second quarter of 2007. Aerospace had another record second quarter and first half. Sales are trending somewhat lower than last year, but better program execution, improved contract mix and lower unrecoverable cost contributed to their higher earnings. Prudent household sales volumes are down from a year ago, but earnings are much improved from a very low base due to better manufacturing performance and some price recovery. Interest expense is $3 million lower in the quarter compared to a year ago due to lower rates, and full-year interest expense should at least $10 million lower than 2007. Lower employee costs and lower uncovered aerospace expenses account for the majority of reduction in G&A expenses. And a stronger euro added $0.07 per diluted share in the quarter compared to a year ago. Turning to free cash flow, we still anticipate full-year free flow to be the range of $300 million, which is after deducting the one-time $70 million legal settlement paid in the first quarter. We also anticipate full-year capital spending to be around $330 million, lower than our first quarter forecast, and we still foresee more than 50% of that spending being for the new top line growth projects. Turning to the balance sheet, our net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was at $2.7 billion, entirely due to seasonal working capital requirements, elevated stock purchases and a strong euro. As we look ahead to the second half, free cash flow is on target and we should see net balance sheet debt of less than $2.3 billion at the year-end, which means we have very strong second half cash flow. The announced full-year 2008 $300 million stock buyback program is still on target and through the first half we have purchased a net $181 million of stock and we continue to see excellent value in our stock buyback program, especially at these prices. With that, I will turn it over to John.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Ray. In the second quarter, our various business segments performed well in a tough environment and generally exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned in the first quarter conference call, 2008 is a year of execution but equally importantly a year to position ourselves well for 2009 and beyond. While much more needs to be done, we currently are in line and on target for all of our businesses to meet these objectives. In light of the core cost inflation we are seeing, pricing initiatives are well underway in all of our packaging businesses as we have no choice, but to pass along the higher costs we are entering. Overall pricing, new pass through models on energy and freight and other risk management initiatives are being discussed both in person and in writing with all of our customers and all of our segments where our contracts allow. In terms of second quarter performance, Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia came in near our expectations from a profit point of view despite weaker volumes in our 12 ounce business and difficult comps related to the remaining North American metal inventory holding gains that benefited us in the second quarter of last year. Normalizing for the prior year's metal gains, segment performance was relatively flat even with rising costs and decreased unit sales, but up 11% since 2006 which would factor out any impact of inventory holding gains. Overall, volumes in North America were down by more than 5% versus a 3% industry decline due to slower CSD volumes, and as we have mentioned on our first quarter call, our beer volumes are lower as a result of our decision last year to not participate where we felt pricing actions did not make business sense. Our specialty can business continues to grow although at a slower rate due to the overalls lower consumer sales throughout the convenient store channels that most of our customers are experiencing. Our new 24-ounce capacity in Monticello, Indiana will be on stream during the third quarter this year and we look to continue to provide additional can formats and other innovations to help our customers win in the marketplace. Our Kent, Washington 12-ounce beverage plant will cease operations in late August, and we continue to monitor very closely the overall soft demand for carbonated soft drinks in the U.S. We must ensure that we are economically sustainable for the long term in our 12-ounce business and customer negotiations regarding contract maturing in future years have begun. In China, year-over-year sales volumes were up around 20% driven by promotional activities ahead of the Olympics and continued growth in the use of cans in the beer segment. We continue to assess opportunities to respond to this growth. Strong demand continues in Brazil with overall industry volume growth of approximately 11% year-to-date and we expect this strong demand to continue. Our capacity addition in our existing facility is progressing nicely and we expect this to be on stream in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, our new Rio de Janeiro plant is underway and we expect to break ground in the third quarter of this year. In our European operations, our volumes grew 7% in the quarter despite some poor weather conditions in Poland and other eastern and central European countries that you witnessed if you watched the Euro Cup Soccer tournament on television. In addition, sporadic freight interruptions and customer strikes, particularly in France and to a lesser extent in Spain, caused some slowdown in shipments. Overall, industry volume grew about the same 7% throughout Europe with continued steady growth across all regions, and we have seen an acceleration of overall beverage can shipment during the past several weeks. From a profitability point of view, EBIT was down in the quarter due in part to the timing differences of businesses interruption insurance that Ray mentioned in his comments. However, when compared to 2006, which is a more apples-to-apples comparison, EBIT is up 20% over the two years. Also impacting profitability were costs associated with our capacity expansion projects. The various projects we are pursuing in this segment are all on time and on budget, including our new Lublin, Poland facility, which is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2009. We continue to monitor the regional economies very closely and we will adjust our timing depending on market conditions. Turning to Metal Food & Household Products, it continues to improve. Our pricing initiatives, continued operational improvements and improved mix added to the quarter. Volumes for the quarter were down mid-single digits, in part due to decisions to walk away from certain business and in part to continued lower-than-expected food can shipments as customers finished working off high inventories. We have begun to see a pickup in food can volumes over the past several weeks as customers prepare for the seasonal pack. Our aerosol volumes came in as we had planned. Performance out of this business is progressing, and year one of our three-year improvement plan is playing out as we expected. The previously announced rationalization program is on schedule and should deliver at least $15 million of cost savings in 2009. Reaping the cost savings of our ongoing rationalization plan, pricing initiatives, contract administration and cost recovery will ensure our three-year goals are met. Customers are being notified of the steep steel price hikes anticipated for 2009 and our need to recover these and other costs. Plastic Packaging, Americas results are comparable with last year after adjusting for a small write-down associated with a customer bankruptcy. Volumes from monolayer, carbonated and non-carbonated containers in the quarter were down approximately 10%, while custom containers were up 15%. And custom containers now represent approximately 25% of our total volume. Many of the same C-store trends that I mentioned in my comments about our North American Beverage Can volumes ring true in our monolayer 20-ounce CST and water business. We continue to adjust our supply to meet current and future market demands, and we believe we are on track to improve this business beginning in 2009. As we indicated on our last conference call, Ball Aerospace will have another good year in 2008. Second quarter performance is evidence of that. Backlog for the quarter finished at $654 million, which is down from $727 million at the end of the first quarter. We will likely gain more visibility on the outlook for 2009 and future contracts prospects and awards after the presidential election. So in summary, we have programs in place to respond to the increasing cost impacting our packaging businesses. We have taken actions to improve pricing now and in the future. We are controlling cost across the operations. We are focused on building the backlog in our Aerospace segment. And we've an excellent team with employees up and down the company focused on delivering the earnings and free cash flow that we and our shareholders expect. Dave?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, John, and thanks also Ray for your comments. I am really gratified that our company has progressed so far this year and that… the programs that John was talking about that we have in place to continue to improve this enterprise. All of our employees are working really hard and I appreciate everyone's effort. But we are not anywhere near finish. We see opportunities in each one of our businesses to improve performance and we are going hard after them. Even with the tough economic conditions we've experienced to date, our goal for the second half of 2008 is to succeed last year's solid second half performance. We have a great portfolio of businesses, a solid balance sheet and financial flexibility to respond to opportunities to grow our business. And with that, Tommy, I guess we are ready for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Wachovia. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Panjabi, your line is open for your question.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Hi guys, good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Ghansham. How’d you beat George?
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: I guess faster fingers, I don’t know. Anyway, looking back to the third quarter of '07, your European operating margins… bev can operating margins were 6.5% if my model is correct. Was there anything unusual in there, any business interruptions, insurance proceeds, inventory gains, etcetera, or is that a quaint number?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I'll take a shot. I think... I guess I have to check this, and you can get the exact numbers from me. But I think there was a couple of million dollars in the last two quarters for business interruption insurance. It pretty much tailed off, the second quarter was plastic payment and then there was a little bit… and there was nothing else unusual that I can remember. John, do you remember--?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No, I can't recall anything else.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: So if volumes fall to the single digits, then should operating margins be comparable to last year, adjusting for the 2 million?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, we have… let me explain this a little bit more. I'm going to talk about the second quarter and we will relate throughout the rest of the year. Three factors affected the earnings and margins in the quarter in Europe. First is the difficult comp compared to last year's result of the closeout of the insurance settlement related to the 2006 fire. Back in 2006 recall, we talked about the challenge of working with our insurance company, to match the business interruption insurance proceeds with the cost and loss profit associated with the prior... with the fire, and in 2006 we settled that. As time went on, there is always disconnects where the closeout ultimately created a situation where the match between the two is more favorable in the second quarter of 2007 relative to prior quarters. However, going forward the comparables around this are relatively clean, and so I don't expect that to have an impact going forward. But two other factors or three other factors really did impact Europe. One, we had an unfavorable product mix issue. We mentioned on my comments of temporary slowdown in the East due to the weather. This did create some negative mix issues for us. However, in speaking with our customers they all believe this region is going to pick up in the second half and we indeed have begun to see this pick up over the last three or four weeks. Another issue is we have been incurring additional costs related to our new projects, whether it be higher labor cost as we begin to hire employees and train them in our other facilities or significantly higher freight costs as we ship product into these regions to seize the market in order to ensure we are going to be at full capacity for our new plants as they come on stream. We would expect going into the third and fourth quarter some of those costs… we're still going to have some of those in this part of our investment for the future. We talked about the strikes in France and Spain, but all in all, we are aggressively managing these issues and we do feel constructive about the future going forward.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Okay. And Ray, on the corporate expense line, the delta there, year-over-year? Thanks.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, a lot… actually, believe it or not, a lot of that is the… are you talking about the actual statements attached to the press release, Ghansham?
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Yes.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A lot of that speak… a lot of it comes from Aerospace, believe it or not, on the unrecoverable cost. They are way down year-over-year. That and some of our employee costs are down, those are the two big items.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you very much. And we will proceed to our next question from the line of George Staphos of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead, sir.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Sorry, I was… we had a couple of other conference calls we had to deal with today.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I’m disappointed you aren’t first, but [inaudible] okay.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: We'll give the crown to Ghansham today. Listen, in terms of the business interruption insurance, was it a couple of million or was it $17 million? I’m--.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me explain that because Anne [ph] came into my office [inaudible] she had a bunch of questions on this. Let me explain this. You go back and look at our conference and go back to what we said in the conference calls, when we first had that fire we said that we're going to negotiate our insurance companies and we were going to do our best to try to match. When we recorded the business interruption insurance, when we thought in fact it fell. The way accounting works on something like that is you can’t record a problem until you actually get the money. And so when we're negotiating and sorting all that through, I mean these are in… through most of 2007, when we were doing that we were trying to do the best of match when we got the cash versus when we thought the profits lie. So when we say… for example, when we say that we're $17 million in the quarter, there was $11 million in the first quarter. And so, what happen… and you would expect more in the second than the first because that business… Europe makes more in the second than the first. So, I think the point is that we're never exactly sure when exactly it should fall, so maybe that 3 million or 4 million of that or some amount maybe should belong to another quarter, I couldn't tell you. The point is, we had… that was our largest… the largest cash payment from the insurance company was in the second quarter of '07 and certainly most of that money should belong in that quarter, but maybe not all of it. Does that help?
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Yes. Ray, no one is going to go back and audit these, we’re just… we’re trying to figure out what we should--.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, but I am just trying to explain how the… and we can't book something before we actually get the cash. So we tried to sort of match the infusion of the cash with when we thought that the interruption insurance was in, and the second quarter was the largest payment, that's all.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: And I think we wrote words about that in last year's 10-Q.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it's in the 10-Q. All that was disclosed in our 10-Q, but at the end of the exercise I think our point with the $17 million is, it was our largest payment and we didn't have it this year and maybe some of it belong to other quarters, we couldn't tell you.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: We understand, we are not quibbling with that. We're just trying to figure out again in order to show ourselves what the comparison figures or the best that you can estimate, the best that we can estimate. So at $17 million in last --.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I am getting it, George. Maybe, $2 million or $3 million or $4 million of that maybe some belonging to first, maybe some belonging to third, I don't know.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: No worries. Now, as we look at cash flow and CapEx and the use of $20 million or $30 million on CapEx relative to your overall free cash flow budget for year, it is rounding your obviously free cash flow, there is a lot of things that can move that number, but I was curious with CapEx perhaps being a little bit less than expected, what is giving you reason perhaps to just keep the free cash flow guidance for the year where you’ve had it and --?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, if you go back to towards… we always… 300 was going to be tough for us and as John pointed out in his comments, we are working real hard to take a close look at everything we do because we are going to deliver that cash flow. The other thing that's happening is with all these raw material and other increases, well, probably not an exchange, well, probably neither can we get all that working capital back out. We're going to get by far the majority of it out, but we are not going to get all of it and it's probably in our best interest not to get it all of that. So the end of the exercise if you think about it mentally, the reduction of capital spending, just take the money and put into working capital.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Got it.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Vis-à-vis exchange or the fact that we make out a little bit more, we kept going into it, and the other thing is when you do the numbers you are going to see that we need to flow at least $530 million of free cash flow in the second half to hit those kind of numbers.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Understand.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: And George, I'll just add on from an operating point of view we have very clear and distinct plans of how to get that working capital out because we need to position ourselves to the future in terms of not only our P&L but also our balance sheet.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Understand. The last one, I will turn it over, should we read anything into the fact that year-to-date I guess you're running a little bit ahead of your overall… if I annualize it, your goal for share repurchases and your comment about you're finding good value in the share repurchase program.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean not only you should [ph] read anything into it other than fact that at these prices, I'd like to buy $500 million of the stock and our balance sheet says that right now that it's prudent for me to do what we're doing. And as we look at next year we'll see what we need to do. As I say, we plan to have a strong buyback program next year, we'll see what size it is and let me get to end of this year.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Fair enough, thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. And we'll proceed to our next question from the line of Timothy Thein of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup: Hi, thank you. First… just two questions. One, if you could comment at all, I think you mentioned in Europe... or correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was Europe that you said you're starting to see… or you're seeing improvement as you’ve… in early days here in July, but I'm curious if you can share what you're seeing in North America thus far here in the quarter? And then separately, what did the currency help you, I think you… I missed it if you said it in terms of the per-share impact, but I'm also curious what it added to the revenue improvement in Europe [inaudible]? Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: In North America, it's challenging out there is what I’d tell you. It’s… I'm sure you all look at CCE and what they’ve had to do and some of the other of our big customers out there, it is chilling, soft drink is down in the mid-single digits, beers is flat to up slightly in terms of overall industry volumes, and as we go forward CCE is announced… for example, they’ve announced that… their take-home channel that they're going to be increasing prices after Labor Day. That's going to have an impact most likely on our business and that's why I said in my comments that we are aggressively and proactively planning for various contingencies because we need to match our supply with the demands in the marketplace, and as we go forward we're going to be committed to doing that. This is an economic climate where I think many of our customers should have been caught off-guard, whether it’s the significant slowdown in the c-store channel or the lack of pick-up in the take-home channel. And so it's a very fluid situation and we are being very proactive and are willing and able and are… will respond to any changes in demand that we see.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, and just to finish the second part of your question, I think I did say in my comments that the impact of the euro was $0.07 for the quarter, $0.10 year-to-date. The interesting part about that, that is really just the conversion of the European earnings… net earnings to the bottom line and that includes after interest, after taxes, after everything. That includes… that’s the conversion of their earnings into the U.S. dollars. Now the interesting point I was talking about Europe as well, they’ve got more than one currency over there. They have got… we deal in other countries other than just the euros. So I think when we go back and at look at the quarter there, their results were a little negatively impacted by some of their exchange differences.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. And we will proceed to our next question from the line of Claudia Hueston of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. Good morning. I was just hoping could talk a little bit more about that transportation issues that you’ve had in Europe, sort of just… a little bit of color on what exactly has happened there and where it’s based in now as we move into the quarter? Thanks.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, well there’s two issues really, there is one issue that relates to where we currently do business and currently manufacture business. With the sharp rise in oil throughout many of the Western European countries and I'm thinking specifically of the U.K., France and Spain, there has been all sorts of strikes going on. We seeing a significant increase in the cost of petrol and we are actively and aggressively talking with our customers about that, but the freight created a lot of dislocation as… the freight strikes created a lot of dislocation that we had to back-fill and do some other things that added some cost to our systems, so that is one point. The other point is as we going to other countries, whether it’s Eastern Poland, whether it’s India and some other places, we are shipping cans there and that is of significant cost. We view that cost as we need to do that to feed the market to make sure that we are well positioned and when our facilities get up and running that they are at or near capacity as opposed to building something, crossing the fingers and hoping that demand will come. So those are really the two issues going on from a freight perspective in Europe.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan: That's really helpful, and in terms of the strikes, are they still going on sort of often or have they kind of stopped do you think?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: We all know that it was really in the May and June time frame, and one of our big customer in France I think publicly disclosed that they were having some issues and it did have… no doubt it had impact to us not only from our volume perspective but from a cost perspective as well.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: When we were in England in June, the people at Hall [ph] Gasoline for BP struck for seven days. They tend to kind of come out and say, okay, we are going go on a seven-day strike, whatever it might be, it is a little different, but it really puts sand in the gears of your distribution system and it raises the cost temporarily.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan: Okay. That's helpful. Could you also just tell me what the shares were at the end of the quarter, the shares outstanding?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it is on the face of our… it's a little bit lower than the number that you see, it’s about 98 million.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan: Okay.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: [inaudible].
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan: Yes. That's what I wanted. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. I wonder if you could just recap for us all of the new lines that you have coming up over the next 12 to 18 months?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Let me take a stab at that --.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: I think you mentioned couple at Brazil.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Well, we have a capacity expansion on Brazil that's well on the way and then we have a new plant that we have not even broken ground on that, but we have plans to do that. We are paying very close attention to all the economies because the North America has a cold and we need to be very cognizant of what happens if that impacts other countries. So, in Brazil we are being very close to that, we see no slowdown in the market, but we're paying close attention to that. So that's a new line, our new plant that will… the current plan is to break ground in the third quarter. We have our Lublin, Poland plant, which is on the Belarus and Ukraine border that serves Eastern Europe as we continue to go east from Poland, and that is on track to be… begin production early in the second quarter of 2009. And that's currently a one-line plan. And we are seeing very strong growth, particularly in the Ukraine market. We have plans to invest in India. We are paying very close attention of that. Depending on the economy down there, we may slow that down a bit. Just to give you an example of the inflation in India, six months ago it was about 3%, now it's 11% and that's going to start to squeeze the middle class. So we're paying very close attention to all these things. And I believe those are... And Monticello, Indiana, which effectively is largely completed, will be up and running within six weeks or so I believe on that line. And those are all the various capacity expansion plans that we have on the pipeline right now.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and just one other issue. With the euro at pretty much record levels against the dollar right now, any thoughts on just hedging a bit?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We do that as on a normal course and as we speak we have various hedges throughout '09 on our conversion of our euros to dollars.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: So is that... Ray, that just goes out through the end of '09, so you’re hedging like 18 months forward, is that right?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I mean basically long-term... I mean we can't... long term if goes up or down, I mean we can’t... it will reflect in our results. What we do by this is we really soften the blow. So if in fact the euro does go down like you are anticipating, our results would be better in '09 than they otherwise would be because we have positions in place that would... that ours would not go down as much. So I can soften the blow, but over the long term our results will hinge on the strength of the euro and the dollar and how that plays out. But I can... we can soften the blows as we move through those periods.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: Yes. And do you hedge any the other currencies, like let's say the [inaudible] or anything?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. These are business situations. As I just said, we have other currencies we deal with. In Europe, we have Polish zlotys, we have the pound sterling, and we have other currencies and normally we have... depending on what we are doing, we hedge up to match to our customer commitments generally.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then final question I have was just on the CapEx side that can line or that end line project that you decided not to go ahead with, can you just give us a little more color on that?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes. Well, this was part of our overall project net that begin several years ago and as we get close to the end, this plays right into what were talked about in managing supply and demand, and as demand has gone down, we think we can get away with not having to put in the last module. And so we're making… not only making, we are executing on plans to do just that.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Sounds good, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning, gentlemen.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Couple of questions for you. First, let me start… one for Dave over your favorite line of business, Aerospace business had an outstanding quarter. Can you give us a little more color as to how the rest of the year flows? Someday, as you wind up some of these projects they tend up higher margin, it showed through this quarter. Is that likely to continue through the balance of this year as some of the project deliveries take place or --?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we had 3% or 4% of margin related to a couple of large programs that as we try to say or as we did say, as they wind down in their fixed-price programs and we do a good job, their margin increases and we are very disciplined on how we do this. So don't expect that kind of margin for the rest of the year, but they're going to have a very solid year, just the way we see that in terms of the profitability. Longer term right now, I don't know if you’ve noticed, but there is an election… a national election going on --.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I wouldn’t have seen any commercial?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, right. So, it seems that the government gets sort of wrapped around the axel at these times in terms of making budgets or passing anything. We’re on the trial of a couple of really good big programs and they are being delayed. Not sure that we will win them, but we are… they are in our sweet spot. So it's just hard to predict. We keep hearing good things about, well, it's going to happen now, it's going to happen now. Now, I think the closer we get to the election, the less likely people are to step up and pay attention [inaudible]. In all likelihood, we’ll be working on a continuing resolution in the government's new fiscal year until after our new President takes office. So that's going to hurt us a little, but we're working really hard to build backlog in the business and with some success in some particular parts. But I would say this year is likely to be… at the end of the year, we’ll like the margin for the year and it will be very strong.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And Ray, you must have had too much coffee this morning because you talk so fast. I heard him say the backlog numbers, but I couldn't quite make them out. Could you give me those again?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I must have talked real fast, I don't think I gave you the backlog numbers. But you’d be right, I was talking fast.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I think this is --.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And I don’t have it. John, you’ve got--.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, this is John. I must have been impersonating Ray. Backlogs --.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: That’s hard to do.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Backlog for the quarter… at the end of the second quarter was $654 million.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. 654. Other question I had for you was, you talked about I think in response to Mark’s questions, some of the capacity you had. I forget what the amounts of capacity were. Did you think… you said one line [inaudible] if you could tell how many units that equates to and then the units for the Brazilian piece as well?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, in Poland, excuse me, it's approximately 700 million cans. In Brazil, the speed-up was 200 million to 300 million and then the [inaudible] line, which realistically won't come on until the end of '09. Really going into 2010, it is about 700 million as well.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And then the last question I had was one of the things I did see when I had my… all these television commercials, was that there is a large brewer in the U.S. that looks like they’re going to be bought. They also have a can business there that could be pretty attractive. Could you maybe give us a little on your thoughts as to with the industry support going from four to three or does… a little bit of thought on the acquisition environment and what… whether you think something like that will feasible going from four to three in the industry?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think it's feasible to go from four to three. I think the beer industry is respectively gone from three to two or from four to two, five to two, whatever you want to say. So, feasible, yes, and in a market that's relatively mature and so on maybe it's likely. I certainly don't know what the folks at InBev and at Anheuser-Busch plan to do relative to this. Obviously, both of them are good customers of ours and we would be prepared to talk to them at any time, but that's in their court. I'd suggest you talk to them about what their plans might be.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Alton Stump of Longbow Research. Please go ahead, sir.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning. Had a quick question, not to I guess beat a dead horse on bev cans in Europe, but it looks like just from a peer margin perspective that with one of the lower better quarters you’ve had in a while and you've already talked about some of the costs that have popped up over the course of quarter. Obviously, one of your major competitors came out with a very strong number in that segment. Just trying to get an idea of is there anything else that we’re missing there that was a one-time impact in the second quarter or was it truly just some of these costs, whether it was for the strikes or elsewhere?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No, I think it was just we are pretty transparent. This is truly what's going on our business.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: John did mention one thing that I might re-emphasize in terms of where we sold is important, but also what we sold, so the mix issue hurt us a little more in the second quarter than we might have thought. And… but for the strikes and the wet weather, who knows this probably might have been a double-digit quarter for the market and for us. So we don't see that as necessarily changing the trend or certainly not from the customers that we talk to and about their aggressive plans to grow throughout, particularly the Eastern European region.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. I think you mentioned, John, that they were [inaudible] products with the plant that you are building for the first half of next year in Poland. And I think you mentioned that you thought costs would still be there obviously in the back half of the year. But can you give me an idea of the magnitude in the back half on a per quarter basis, how that would compare to what it was in 2Q?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, it's a good question, I don’t want to invade it. It's a few million euros, few million euros. It's always tough to pin down because as you are talking… for example, as you are talking about we've hired new people for the plant, but we've put them in our facilities for training purposes. To track that on a person-by-person basis it would hire, we need to hire five more accounts to do that and that doesn't make sense at all. So it's a few million euros in the quarter.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Thank you, good morning. Just really a couple of questions. First, John Hayes mentioned some price initiatives across the business. Can you just talk about a little bit more in detail where those are? I know that some of it just… perhaps just passing through metal pricing, but could you just elaborate more on what price initiatives are underway?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, as I mentioned, we have price initiative underway in all of our business with all of our contract where allowed by contract. We have some existing contracts and we are looking at them very hard in terms of freight pass-throughs, in terms of other things like that. We have send letters out in certain of our businesses talking about where we are allowed to the need for recovery these costs. But equally if not more importantly, as our contracts come up for renewal we are taking a fresh look at everything. And I mentioned the core pricing initiatives, I mentioned cost pass-through models taking a fresh look at that and making sure that we're balancing the risk taken in those contracts so that we are not taking unnecessary risk and we are getting paid for the value delivered. So what I would tell you is in every one of our businesses these discussions are ongoing.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, and I think that… No, I was just going to add that we are communicating with clarity and in detail about all these things, trying to be in advance as much as we can.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: And can you elaborate on how much of your business is currently up for renewal?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, again it varies by business, but I would say a significant amount across the portfolio is up for renewal over the next 18 months.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: second question, can you just elaborate it, are there any start-up cost associated with the Indiana can line that will show up in the third quarter or the fourth quarter?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: No, probably not so big that it would be meaningful. Yes, when you start a line you usually… as you're flipping from capitalizing the last cost and to getting to the operation, there is some costs but I don't think it will be a big number.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: One of the things… and we invest in things like that. It's very important that we invest where we have high confidence in that the people are going to deliver on the commitments, and our Monticello facility is a wonderful facility. The people there are tremendous and we have high expectations that they are going to hit the ground running.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Hopefully, Ross Rittberg, the plant manager was listening to that.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just lastly, Ray talked about in the past sort of a 10% to 15% earnings growth year-over-year and as you look at 2008, is there any reason why you would not expect that to happen in '08?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I am not sure I understood the question.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Let me just try it this way and they you can take a dig. I mean one of my comments were I think we had something like 25% last year and between the two years we are certainly going to exceed those… you'll see our top end, whether in fact we can have 10% to 15% in '08 remains to be seen.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean what we… what I said and I think we wrote it in our press release is that our goal is to exceed the second half. We try to give real specific guidance. Interestingly, you all seem to know exactly what we are going to make, we usually have to close the books to find out each… and with 98 million shares outstanding, less than $1 million of net income is a penny and we are a $7.5 billion company. All that being said I think we are optimistic that… there are parts of this company and you could just go over all the different operations that are definitely on the way up. We've got between this year, the next year and the year after programs in place to incrementally improve on both the operating side and the pricing side various parts of the company. Demand on some of our best customers as John talked about is little soft. So… and he also said, and Ray said that we're going to run, not to build a lot of inventory and report profits this year that won't show up next year. So we’ve got to manage that working capital down too, if necessary. But given all of those things and everything we know about and all the volatility, we are feeling pretty good about the opportunity to beat last year’s second half and then somebody might say, well, by how much, and I’d say, well, by as much as we can. And that's where we are in July. It's not a negative message, it's just that we're going to control we everything and push hard and operate better, and as Ray has been pointing out, if you integrate the last couple of years we've taken a big step forward in the performance of the company and I think there is more to come.
Rick Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. And the next question comes from the line of Andy Fineman [ph] of Iridian Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: Thanks. Are there steel suppliers honoring their contracts?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: We're having challenging discussions with many of our steel suppliers, but we have very firm contracts with virtually every one of them and we're taking a very firm legal position with that, and… but we also recognize that we need a healthy supply chain over the long-term and what we've been doing is warning our customers, not only warning, but communicating very clearly with our customers that going into 2009 the price increases related to steel and other input costs are going to be significant and material.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: Okay. When do you finish pre-selling in Europe?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Finish pre-selling, I am not sure I understood the question.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: Yes, you are shipping product in to pre-sell your new capacity and that’s caused some costs in the quarter.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: And I think you said that new capacity in Poland comes on second quarter of '09, so does that mean that that's when the pre-selling costs go away because it’s--?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, you understand the seasonality of our business, so it's most impactful in the summer months, but it's also India as well, and as we… what we are looking at India is working with our global supply if you will, with our licensees and with our Asian operations to make sure we're optimizing as we see that market… to make sure we're optimizing the cost as we see that market because we continue to see very strong growth, but we are a bit cautious that with the increase of the inflation and the budget deficits India is starting to run, what are the implications of that. So we're being very mindful of all of that.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: Now, you guys have made a tough decision regarding beverage can capacity in North American, which I commend you for, it’s not easy to close capacity. And last year Crown closed some capacity. I'm kind of shocked that we haven't seen any capacity closure announcements yet from Rexam and then I hope we will. Is there anything that would prevent you or any of your competitors from closing capacity like for instance the transportation costs to reach customers would be too high, so therefore you’ve got to keep the sub-optimal plan operating?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, obviously I can only speak for ourselves. When we are looking at capacity, when market demand goes down it's not 1 billion in this part of a region or 1 billion in that part, it's a 100 million here, 200 million there, and so inevitably you’ve customer contracts you need to honor and live up to and those… at least for us we have contracts that count go as far as 2015 and are short of end of 2008. And so when we're looking at overall capacity, freight certainly does play a factor in terms of the customer commitments and how long you have to have out-of-pattern freight expenses related to servicing those contracts. So no doubt that is a factor in all this.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: But I think, Andy, if you are in this business and you have a lot of plants, there are a few that are at the edge usually for most people, I can't... as Ray or as John said, I can’t speak for others, but we are doing a lot of thoughtful analysis and planning and scenario making around what happens here and there. I think that over the last decade or so, all of the can companies, maybe with exception of metal container have shut their capacity from time to time. And one must deal with the reality of the market and we're… we need it all to run at high rates in order to get our cost the most it can be. And so, we’re just trying to… as John has been saying to do our part to keep the supply/demand balance.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: So it sounds like what you are saying, Dave, is that as far as you can see there is no reason why you are… or any of your competitors… you or any of your competitors couldn't take advantage of the opportunity to reduce capacity if they see fit?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I think I would agree with that. Yes. And certainly I think all have from time to time and I expect will in the future.
Unidentified Analyst - Iridian Asset Management: Thank you.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim Burns of Cranial Capital. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Tim.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: I’ve got a suggestion. I think you ought to put up a Ray resistant coffee delivery system in the office, because I unfortunately, Ray, have to go visit a therapist for carpal tunnel syndrome after these conference calls. And it's becoming like my left foot, I'm using my left foot and not right.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Hey Tim, it's really 24-hours energy is what Ray is after.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Well, either way, put some child-resistant caps on those. I had a question for and I know it was hit earlier, I always hate that, but John, when you talked about new pass-through models being discussed, core pricing initiatives, freight pass-through, so on and so forth, I mean, I think of all the businesses that we follow in packaging, the metal leverage can business has done as well as almost anybody in getting price pass-through, it shows. But doesn't that have to be a win-win for your customer and how do you do that?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, it does, and in part Dave was talking about freight optimization in terms of the various plant networks and we're trying to talk with our customers because, look, it's not easy for them either, their volume is going down, their costs are going up and they need to push it on to the consumer. But having said all that, we are trying to work with our customers to optimize this whole supply chain. You're right on… in North American metal bev the whole medal side of it, it has been relatively efficient, but let's not forget energy, and energy in terms of running our plans and energy in terms of freight. When oil is at... even at $60, $70, $80 a barrel, it’s very different than when it’s at $130 or $140. And to put a new spotlight on those types of costs to try and optimize it for the… for our customers and for ourselves, those are the types things we're doing, and so just putting more discipline in the whole process.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: It sounds like you're trying to make it more seamless, so the chain is lubricated and nobody gets stock except the consumer probably. But I think I hear you. The other thing is somebody once said that growth is overrated and while 5% to 8% growth in Europe, isn’t anything to overlook, there is no holding back that North America and Europe are fairly consolidated markets. I mean, Europe grows in some cases because you guys basically acquire another country. But allowing for that, growing internationally is very risky as you guys will know, and yet beyond Eastern Europe it sounds like you are going to be going into territories where there is already established competition or where the way of doing business and how people do business is quite different. I mean how do you approach that?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, one of the things… you just hit the way of doing business. One of the differentiators of, we believe… of Ball relative to other people is we are very close with our customers and understanding and anticipating their needs. And when you think about all, let's talk about beer for a minute. Think about all the acquisitions that have happened by the majors in many of these disparate regions. The consolidation and I don't have the facts in front of me, but of a Russia or a Ukraine or an India, five years ago they had breweries you’d never heard of and now 80% generally speaking of the market share is controlled by one of the Big Four, Big Five beer companies. They have certain ways of doing business and we… and they need to rely on a supplier that is not going to let them down. And so those types of things that we're in discussions with, we often bring customers here to Colorado, we go out and see them and not talk about price, but we talk about where are the footprints going, where our footprint needs to go and how it can overlap. I'm sure others to do that as well, but that is one of the ways that we do it and it helps to mitigate the rest of that you are talking about because when you talk about risks, there is economic risk, there is customer risk, there is political risk and what we try and to do is whittle those… each one of those down to as low of a possible risk profile so that we get comfortable that we can get returns that represent the risk taken.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Yes, because Dave and I had these conversations quite a bit, but the old game in North America was kind of warfare, my plan is bigger than yours, I've got more capacity than yours, and just as an example I looked at Brazil, obviously our friends from the UK are pretty well established. So how do you kind of in a docile manner come in and make a business and make some money?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've been in Brazil, Tim, for 12 years with our plant in Recife, which is where the speed-up is going on and we're making a different size there too to swing it to line. And then in the real estate we're seeing a 10% compound growth. We make a business through the market growth, and hopefully we will get the one line in and I believe that we're going to be able sell those cans right away and over time we can add capacity there. What’s interesting about… we were in one of these discussions John talked about just a week ago with a large customer from Europe who was here and there are a lot of different discussions that go on. But believe it or not, these folks need our containers, sort of fundamentally maybe I don't want to buy everything from one guy on maybe I want to grow into this marketplace where not only are there no existing can plants, but I'm building a new brewery, and… or I am a soft drink person. I am going to fill soft drinks. So I think the growth that you talked about taking the risk, we've been taking risks in some interesting places for a long time. We've had our lumps, some of that is we have a lot of institutional memory about that and I think that there is more risk in some of these markets, but actually the business that… if you think of Europe the business that we own now has been in business and been owned in part by American companies for 50 years.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We don't use the same cost of capital wherever we are in the world, it’s different cost of capital to take in those capital risks.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: But let's be clear, our growth is we try to grow where markets are growing so that we’re growing with the market because you shouldn't expect that we’re going to have any opposite strategy than that because you're absolutely right, growth for growth sake doesn't mean anything. What we're looking at is profitable growth.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Well, listen, I think there is two very good stewards in the mature markets and I think that the Big Three are only going to do good things, I think smart pricing management and they need it, you guys need it to further grow the earnings. And so... and the last thing I got, I'm sorry if I'm taking this up, Dave, you don't do any commercial airline stuff, do you?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: No, not at this point. I fly occasionally.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: Lucky you. But then the last thing was, Chris Manuel talked about the whole InBev AB saga and everybody's been calling on AB to buy MCC for probably, what ten years or so. But could it be more interesting or more risky in terms of InBev changing the contract structure or linking it to global supply where I think you guys might have an advantage, I mean, any thoughts?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No. Not that we want to discuss with you.
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: What do you mean with me, do I have like some kind of plague or something?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No, I don't know about the size of a check book and I don't think [inaudible].
Tim Burns - Cranial Capital: I understand. Thanks a lot.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our next question is another follow-up question from the line of Mr. George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead, sir.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. Hi, guys. Quickly, was there any metal gain in Europe in this quarter? I know you mentioned North America, just wanted to confirm that?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: No.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Secondly, did Asian profits move in line with Asian sales in the quarter?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Directionally, guys, I don’t need...
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, they were up year-over-year. Absolutely in line with what John said [inaudible].
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay, third question. PET, are you in a position to comment where you stand with the margin recovery process, realizing it might not necessarily be an ’08 event from a timing standpoint? Has much of the work being done? How would you index it if you had to?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll just go back to the comments that I said in the prepared remarks that we believe going into 2009 that we are on track to improve this business.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay, fair enough. I guess the last question. You talked quite openly about how you have to shine a light on the risks that you take in the… not just in international markets, but even within North America and some of the things that have changed in the overall cost structure over the last 5 and 20 years or so. And I guess at the end of the day, are you still prepared as you were with Kent to continue to rationalize your capacity, if the customer and you ultimately disagree on what the right relative return on that business, on that supply arrangement, on that commitment from your standpoint is?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I will reiterate what I said, we're prepared to balance our supply with what we see in terms of our demand.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Once more with emphasize, John?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I mean, I think, the other comments that we make in this kind of an environment, we don't really have a choice, so we've got to be understanding of what's the economic environment that we deal with. You may recall a gentleman that used to work here who used say that we don't like to do things for practice and I'm optimistic that we're out ahead of these things and we're going to do our very best, understanding that we're part of a supply chain and we're in this for the long run, but we've got to make adequate returns.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: David, is it possible to... as you see capacity creep and as you see perhaps some deterioration in demand in CST in North America to utilize that capacity that you had in North America, one, for one-for-one in international markets and emerging markets or is that probably too aggressive a ratio?
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: It's probably form a capital point of view a touch too aggressive, but generally speaking you're correct.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: That certainly is in our mind, George.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: The notion of that, and then if you also think about the various moves that we made our the last several years in modifying capacity so that it makes other sizes, sizes other than 12-ounce can, it is a big chunk of our business these days and it's almost a different product.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Final question and I will turn it over. Do you sense any change in your customers’ expectations for packaging mix over the next two to three years? So obviously the can industry, probably capacity is not going up, but perhaps PT capacity might go up, but that wouldn't happen if the customers weren't envisioning using more and more of that in the mix, same thing within the peer market. Do you expect anything especially within North America to change from a package mix standpoint that would alter your ability to manage supply/demand?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I think, George, what you'll see going forward is our customer base generally speaking trying out new and different formats whether it's in the plastic bottle or a beverage can to try and really relate to the consumer and try and look at price points relative to the consumer and price points relative to the various channels that they sell into. And so I think that this whole diversity issue and proliferation of SKUs we see increasing, not decreasing.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: We’ve been done a lot of work with... directly with our customers and doing our own market research and so, and we’ve got a number of innovative things going on around our packages, from the type of planning, the kind of closure, you can see the ads on TV and a lot of that sort of stuff, and that's the kind of things John was talking about. In the end, we went with the winners, and right now with demand being a little soft I don't know that they know exactly what is going to happen there, but I can assure you that the beverage can and PET bottles that there are going to be a lot of those made in three years as are today. Whether there is a mix shift [inaudible] I don't know, but if you take a look most every raw material is going up in price and I’m not sure they’re at the same time, but it’s all happening. So we are in an inflationary environment and we all have to manage differently in that mode. I was just talking with someone day, the last time the oil prices were like this with the early ‘80s… late ‘70s, early ‘80s and we had a 22% prime rate. Now we've got one that is may be two. I don't get what's going on with all the, but I'm just quite were in the business we are in and not in some others like that airline industry that Tim was talking about a while ago.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Well, I'll let you go, guys. Have a good quarter. Thanks very much.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Mr. Hoover, there are no further question at this time. I'll turn the call back to you.
R. David Hoover - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Tommy. Thank you very much, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I do want to note that our third quarter earnings conference call we’re going to be scheduling for October the 30th, which is probably a week or so later than normal. Just want to put that out there and we'll remind everybody about that again in late September. But thanks again for being with us, and we're going to go back to work and have a good third quarter.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind you today's call is being recorded, Thursday, April 24, 2008. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Hoover, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, Mr. Hoover.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Fardin. Good morning. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2008 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q, and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you do not already have that release, it is available on our Web site at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With me on today's call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Ball. Well we had a solid first quarter and a good start to the year. We said back in January that we expected it to be a challenge to meet our unusually strong results of the first quarter of 2007. Our performance improvement is the result of focused efforts by all of our segments. In particular, we are pleased with improved results in our metal food and household products segment and continued strong results from our European beverage can segment, but we are all pushing hard to do better. We are focused on the right things and are beginning to see momentum building in all of our businesses. Ray and John will provide some color on our financial and operations performance, and I will close with a few comments about our outlook. Ray?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave. Comparable diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.80, another first quarter record, up from last year's record per share earnings that were 86% higher than in 2006. Higher European beverage can and food and household earnings, together with a lower share price... share count, more than offset the lower North American beverage can and aerospace earnings. Turning to the operations, both North American beverage cans and aerospace produced record earnings in 2007 and lower segment earnings were expected in 2008. First quarter North American beverage can earnings were lower due to inventory metal gains earned, last year not recurring in 2008, but earnings were better than expected due to good manufacturing performance. Aerospace first quarter earnings were lower due to contract mix and reduced sales volumes. Continued strong double-digit sales growth in Europeincluding growth in custom beverage can sales volumes and the strength of the Euro were the primary factors in higher European beverage can earnings in the quarter. The higher Euro added $0.4 per diluted share in the quarter compared to 2007. The food and household segment is off to a much better start than last year and as we said in our fourth quarter conference call, considerable earnings improvement is expected in this segment in 2008. First quarter sales volumes are down from a year ago, but we anticipate part of this volume decline will be recovered later this year. First quarter food and household earnings are much improved over 2007 due to better manufacturing performance and some price recovery. Due to lower interest rates, interest expense is almost $2 million lower in the quarter, compared to a year ago and full-year interest expense should be at least $6 million lower than in 2007. The first quarter effective tax rate of 32% is a little better than our initial expectation and it should be sustainable for the full year. Turning to cash flow, we anticipate full-year free cash flow to be in the range of $300 million, including a one-time payment in January of $69 million related to a customer settlement reached in the third quarter of 2007; and some build-up of inventory levels in 2008. The full-year free cash flow forecast also includes $350 million of capital spending which will be affected by currency exchange rates, as many of our capital projects will occur in Europe. As we said on our fourth call, approximately 75% of capital spending will be in worldwide beverage can business and more than 50% of that spending will be for new top-line growth projects. Cost reduction and maintenance capital should be less than 60% of depreciation expense. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was at $2.6 billion, higher than in December 2007 due to seasonal working capital requirements, elevated stock purchases and a stronger Euro. Our December 2008 target is to have net balance sheet debt of $2.25 billion, which assumes the Euro will weaken a little before the end of the year. The announced $300 million stock buy-back program for this year is proceeding as planned, and in the first quarter we purchased a net $125 million of stock at an average price of under $45 per share. With that I will turn it over to John Hayes.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Ray. As Dave indicated, we are generally pleased with the first quarter, but by no means are we satisfied or content. 2008 is a year of execution. There are a number of key operational initiatives underway to foster harmonization of processes, systems and the way we conduct business to make sure that we are focusing on the right details and are fit for the future. I will lay out a brief summary of some of the first quarter achievements within the operations while also giving an update on the progress we are making in executing our strategic objectives. The first quarter of 2008 got us off to a very good start. Continued focus on cost recovery and our pricing initiatives, continuous improvement on the performance side of all of our businesses and business processes, our focus on growing our overall specialty packaging footprint, and executing on the various restructuring initiatives announced and continued disciplined international expansion are all proof points to the progress we are making as a company. Now, moving to first quarter performance. Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, came in above our expectations from a profit point of view despite difficult comps related to North American inventory holding gains on metal that benefited us in the first quarter last year. Continued excellent operational performance, double-digit percentage growth in specialty cans, improved efficiencies generated from our new end technology and pricing initiatives where allowed by contract, all played a role in offsetting the difference. Overall, our volumes were down by more than 4% in North America due to slower CSD volumes in many of our dedicated supply points, as well as reduced beer volumes as a result of our decision last year to not participate where we felt pricing actions did not make business sense. We announced yesterday plans to close our plant in Kent, Washington. It was a difficult decision, but one that is required if we are to achieve our objective to ensure we are economically sustainable for the long term in our 12-ounce business. We plan to redeploy those assets in other parts of our worldwide system, whether it be in other geographical regions or in other can sizes, where we expect to generate more favorable returns. Management will continue to monitor supply-demand relative to our current and expected future production requirements, and is prepared to react to changes as required. Our specialty can initiatives continue to bear fruit, and we are on time and on budget for the anticipated third quarter start up of our 24-ounce can manufacturing line in Monticello, Indiana. Our current specialty mix is approximately 17%, which is up nicely versus the same quarter one year ago. In China, our volumes were up over 6% in this growing, but competitive marketplace. We are running at full capacity and are currently exploring ways to maintain our share of this market in the most economical way. We continue to enjoy strong growth in Brazil as the can market expands. We are currently starting up 16-ounce can capacity in our Jacarei plant, to take advantage of rapidly growing demand for that package. We are on track for the new plant in the Rio de Janeiro area, which will start up next year. In Europe, we continue to produce strong results. Volumes grew over 13%, while sales and EBIT grew more than 26% and 30% respectively, reflecting our efforts to recover costs and improve margins while continuing to invest in the future and expand our footprint for the future. 2008 will be another tight year in terms of supply and demand, despite the full year effects of our new lines in Hassloch and Hermsdorf, Germany, and this sold out status reaffirms our need to additional capacity to continue our profitable growth. Our new facility in Poland that we announced in January is proceeding nicely and we continue to make progress in India; volumes in both regions continue to grow strongly. Metal food and household products packaging achieved significant improvement in the quarter. Driving this was renewed focus and discipline on cost recovery and the pricing of our products to reflect the value delivered. Better operational performance also contributed in the quarter and our manufacturing people continue to focus diligently on improving the performance of our plants to sustainable levels. Volumes for the quarter in this seasonally slow business were lower than expected and were down approximately 13% due in part to our decision to walk away from business that resulted in the closing of our Tallapoosa and Commerce plants, some unprofitable business that we chose not to meet and overall slower industry volumes as customers worked off higher finished good inventories carried in from 2007. We expect, however, full year volumes to remain consistent with our expectations going into the year. Our pricing initiatives for 2008 are largely completed and on target. Our restructuring activities are on plan and, while one quarter doesn't make a trend or a year, we are beginning to see the performance we expect out of this business. I had a chance to accompany the senior management of this business through all of our facilities several weeks ago, and we are encouraged by the alignment and resolve they have to make this business sustainable. Momentum is clearly building in the food and household organization and disciplined focus on the execution of our plan should continue to deliver measured improvement in operating results in this segment. Plastic packaging, Americas, results are improved over relatively easy comps. Lower monolayer product volumes were offset by higher custom sales, resulting in an improvement of our mix from 12% custom to 16% custom in our PET business year-over-year. While we continue to focus on our costs, we are pushing all levers possible including price, new pass-through models and other measures with all of our customers in order to improve from these economically unsustainable levels. Ball Aerospace continues to perform well on its programs, but to a certain extent we are held back by a slowdown of the U.S. government to award new contracts. Backlog for the quarter finished at $727 million, which is down from $774 million at year end. 2008 should be another good year and while our backlog has declined due to many of those new government programs sliding to the right, we are aggressively pursuing and bidding on several new opportunities that can help to continue the growth of this business. Our renewed focus on embracing a leadership role, revenue and value management, operational performance and driving more employee engagement across Ball is beginning to bear fruit. We are excited about what the future holds if we successfully execute on the plans and objectives we have set for ourselves. With that, I will turn it back to Dave for some closing comments.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John, and thanks also Ray for your comments. We are building new facilities internationally in growth markets, redeploying assets to achieve greater returns on them, consolidating operations to improve results and raising the bar in our ongoing efforts to have leaner, more efficient businesses. We said in our January call that we were going to work hard to exceed last year's results for the full year and it is only April, but we are more confident that we will be able to achieve that. The middle two quarters of the year are usually the strongest quarters in our company. Historically, the third quarter is better than the second quarter. We are also expecting to return at least $350 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases this year. Total dividends and share repurchases through the four years from 2005 through 2008 should exceed $1.1 billion. All of this is occurring while improving our credit quality and appropriately investing for the future. We see opportunities to improve our operations over the next two to three years. We have plans in place to build on our early momentum, and we are focused on executing those plans. With that Fardin, we are ready for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Banc of America. Please proceed.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Thanks, hi everyone, good morning. I guess the first question I have is on the operation, John or Dave or Ray, if you could give a bit more color on what kind of improvement you are seeing via Project NET, what benefits perhaps you have been getting out of operations, reduced spoilage, etc., and how that helped in the quarter. Can we at this juncture twelve months hence talk perhaps on how much the inventory gain was last year so we have a basis for comparison, if not [ph] we understand, and then I have a follow on?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: George, you need to get a little more excited and be like we are. But yes, I think we can talk around all of those points.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the inventory gain in last year's first quarter report was $43 million dollars. Project NET we have always advertised delivering a return somewhere between 10% and 15%. We think that return is about 13% and that is one of the contributors to the improvement in our performance in the first quarter in U.S beverage. Project NET is working exactly as we had planned. John, have you got any other comments?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No, I think that summarizes it well.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: What else are you seeing... I am excited, I am just balancing...
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well you just sounded like you were a little slow off the mark here; I just wanted you to be okay, George.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Oh come on, I am recommending your stock too. So in any event, tell me a little bit about what is going on with spoilage and operations otherwise and how that might have helped the quarter?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: George our operations are performing terrifically well. As you know, manufacturing excellence is a hallmark of Ball and we have been doing very well on that and continue to do well on that. I don't think we ever will or going forward we will break out exact spoilage for a variety of reasons, but we are seeing improvement throughout all of our manufacturing. Not only in beverage can, but I think across the board in all of our product lines.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Last one and I will turn it over. In food can the performance was significantly ahead of last year, so congratulations on that. Again, if you can somehow give us a bit more clarity between how much of it was productivity and how much of it was price. When I take some of your details discussed thus far it seems like pricing was up high single-digits, low double-digits, would you care to comment on that? Thanks guys.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, I think on the food and household product side, we have a variety of moving pieces. As you know we are in the process of restructuring that business with Tallapoosa and Commerce. The manufacturing plants are performing better but what I would tell you is that we still have a lot of room for improvement and our manufacturing people know that and are very focused on achieving that. On the cost recovery side we have tried to be very disciplined because we have been, as we go through it and everyone knows what's been going on in the raw materials market, we have to recover those costs and we have been diligently focused on that and the sales and marketing people have done a very good job in a very difficult environment to make sure that we are getting value for our product.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: And on net pricing, then?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: You had mentioned upper single-digits, lower digits, it varies by customers and we have contracts all over the board, but we are recovering those costs and I think we are generally in line with what we expect.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: All right thanks, guys, I'll turn it over and I'll try to drink some Jolt or something.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Monster, maybe.
Operator: Thank you. The following question coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Wachovia Securities. Please proceed.
Ghansham Punjabi - Wachovia Securities: Hey guys good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Ghansham Punjabi - Wachovia Securities: The closure of the Kent plant, is the capacity going to be reallocated towards specialty cans or is it just sort of rebalancing your supply and demand footprint?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, in the short-term it is rebalancing our supply-demand footprint, because we were not earning appropriate returns on that equipment and so we have, as you know, we have a lot of international expansion going on and we are taking a fresh look at where we can redeploy that equipment. Much of it is 30 years old so when it comes to some of the equipment we are not going to be able to move it but we are very diligently looking on how to reuse that equipment in a more effective way.
Ghansham Punjabi - Wachovia Securities: Okay and in Europe this business has been tremendous for a while now; volumes up 13% off of very, very tough comparisons. Given some of the slowing we are seeing on the consumer side here in the U.S, some thought that maybe Europe is not too far away in terms of a slowdown, what are your customers saying about the outlook for the rest of the year. Are they trying to sort of brace for a slowdown in that particular market?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: As of right now we are not really seeing anything. There are a couple of factors Ghansham that are impacting that. Number one, we have the Olympics and we also have the European World Championships which is very good. As you know, we have a more weighting towards beer than we do soft drink in Europe which helps in that. And the other thing is the can, unlike North America, the can generally in Europe is more of a premium package. So actually, a lot of the volume has been coming from, as it starts to go down a little bit mainstream, it starts getting into the multi-packing and gets into better distribution; whether it is in Eastern Europe or even in Western Europe as well, that is all helping. So we are seeing no slow down. There is an interesting statistic, though, that is important. As you know the can, in particular, is a take-home package in many parts of the world and in recessionary times, at least here in the U.S., at home food consumption goes up 4% and when you put those two things together, we think we are relatively recession proof.
Ghansham Punjabi - Wachovia Securities: Okay, and so if I were to think of just one final question if I could. If '08 is sort of boosted by some pricing in metal food along with productivity and in Europe obviously sounding like it's going to continue for a while in terms of strength there, is it fair to say in '09 maybe '10, maybe pricing in your other businesses start to improve, particularly plastics and maybe North American beverage cans as well, going ahead [ph]?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes I think the comments I made at the end about the next two to three years; each year we think can benefit from a bit of a different lift and everybody has got to get better. We've got a lot of work to do to accomplish that but we see a pretty good track here for the next two or three years, Ghansham for those reasons that you were talking about.
Ghansham Punjabi - Wachovia Securities: Okay great, Thanks so much. Good luck in the quarter.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The following question comes from the line of Claudia Shank Hueston, JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities, Inc: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities, Inc: Just had a couple of questions on metal, food and household business as well. I was hoping you could talk maybe just a little bit about the demand trends in the sub-businesses there and comment on what gives you confidence that volumes will recover in the second half there?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, well, there are a couple of things going on. I had mentioned that our customers had finished 2007 with higher finished goods inventory. We don't expect growth in that business but if you try to neutralize what we have walked away from in terms of the aerosol side and some of the other things, we expect roughly flat volumes adjusted for those conditions. Obviously, as we say every time this year, it depends on how the weather goes this summer and other things like that but we see no reason to think that anything is going to be materially different than it's been in the past and that's what our conversations and our planning is with our customers.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that business for us is more seasonal, even than the beverage business, but recall that the first and fourth quarters are the slow quarters for our company and the middle two are the stronger ones, so I just echo what John said.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities, Inc: Okay, great. And then just in terms of continuing to improve the profitability there, obviously there is a good sort of step change in the first quarter and how should we think about sort of the development of margin improvement over the rest of the year, I mean should we expect sort of even improvement over the course of the year or should it be back-end loaded as we think about it?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No, I think it is going to vary an awful lot about how good, as we said, the weather goes. For example, on the salmon side we know there is a lower expected salmon catch this year up in Alaska which puts a little bit downward pressure on it but a lot of it has to do, we have had a lot of costs increases, we have been recovering those costs in the marketplace and it really comes down to how our manufacturing plants perform through the balance of this year. Going into 2009, let's not also forget that we really do not get much of an effect of the restructuring this year related to Commerce and Tallapoosa, so going into next year that provides us some added upside, if we execute correctly.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities, Inc: Okay, but those benefits would be more for 2009?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Correct.
Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities, Inc: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. The following question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs, & Co.: Good morning, thank you. Dave, I just wanted to touch on the pricing, perhaps in North America. Is there any opportunity from your prospective to perhaps get more pricing as opposed to just the pass-through of the raw materials in the North American beverage can business?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that we are focused like a laser on really understanding what is happening and as we move through contract negotiations with our customers, we and they have to understand that there is inflation back, so this isn't something you do overnight and we do not have eight billion customers around the world, we have several but not many and so we are working really closely with all of our customers to communicate with clarity what it is that we've got to do to get some fun back into our 12-ounce business, for example, and then be sure, and we are driven importantly by cost recovery, but we've gotten a little behind in a place or two for good reason. We've got to turn that around and I think as the economy got used to very low inflation rates but as this comes back, you can talk to any of our customers about it. This is just the packaging costs that are going up for them, so this has got to be recaptured, unfortunately from the consumer, but that's the world that we live in and that's the focus that we've got. What we look at is making the right return for the investment that we have. When we cannot, we do things unfortunately like we just did in Kent, but we are very focused, communicating very well and intend to be, to have businesses all of which make reasonable returns.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, I just might add on to that that it's important. What we are trying to do is getting paid for the value delivered and we do an awful lot of things. You all know about the customer technical service that we do. We also do a lot of hedging and metal management for customers and that creates costs and that is value delivered to our customers. Our quality and lab services, a lot of the things we do well there and then lastly, on the innovation side, yesterday we had a board of director's meeting and the head of innovation of North America stood up and we are talking about 22 product launches across all of our packaging businesses with more than 4 billion units this year of new products that are going to be launched. Some of them are small ones, some of them are larger. In March we launched the recloseable can in Europe; we have the ALUMI-TEK bottle here in North America; in the plastic business we are launching our gamma clear bottle. We have got under-tab printing in the U.S here and at the end of the day what we are trying to do is give our customers and ultimately their consumers a value proposition because we know it's very difficult in the supply chain.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Don't forget the vented end, John.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: And the vented end, correct.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs, & Co.: And on the contracts, do the contracts allow you to, I guess, how often can you go back to your customers to think through if there is an ability to go above the inflationary pricing. Is that on an annual basis or are these contracts multiyear that will take a while to work through?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we do not have a standard agreement with everybody and we are addressing these things as they come up, as we can, and sometimes in advance. So I am not really going to give you a straight answer, because I would have to answer for every different customer. But rest assured, where we... we believe we have fallen behind in the 12-ounce business and we have got to recover and that is a real focus for us. It will not happen overnight, but we can see it.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs, & Co.: okay and then just separately, can you talk to what the drivers were for the decline in volumes in the U.S in beverage cans and does the closing of the Kent plant now get you to where your system is essentially running full across all of the other remaining plants?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes I think in the opening comments I alluded exactly to what was driving the volume in North America in terms of our CSD volumes. We have sole supply areas that were down year-over-year. I think that was more than just a seasonally slow quarter and as people ramp up for the summer time, so I would not read in to too much of that and then we also had a specific situation in beer that a year ago that we chose to walk away from and that hurt our volumes a little bit. But I think as we go forward in the balance of the year we remain relatively constructive that our volumes will be where we think they should be and the announcement of the closing of Kent does help bring our 12-ounce capacity much more in line so that we are fit for the future.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs, & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and the following question's coming from the line of Alton Stump, Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Just had a question on the European BevCan business, obviously a great volume growth in the quarter. Could you just give me an idea from a capacity standpoint what type of volume growth you might be able to handle in '08?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: In 2008, well, as I said earlier, all of our manufacturing assets throughout the world are performing well and not the least of which is in Europe and so every can made is a can sold and we saw great improvement in the first quarter in terms of overall volumes and with Hassloch and Hermsdorf a full year and we are having some speed up projects, remember, in Radomsko, I think we announced last July that's beginning to just start to kick in. So I think we are well positioned in 2008, but it is a very, very tight situation enough our announcement about the plant in Poland for 2009 and some other small speed ups here and there allow us to continue to grow, but in our planning, just so you know, we are not expecting this double-digit growth. So even with all that capacity coming on, we are thinking of mid-single digits and it's above that we are going to have to be scrambling a little bit more.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay, thank you, and then just one quick follow-up. I think I ask you guys this question every conference call, but could you just give me a quick update on Germany and how that market is recovering, if there has been any change, either positive or negative in the last one or two quarters?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: The trends that we have been seeing in Germany are very consistent with what we have said over the last couple of years. We are seeing good growth off low volumes, of a low base, if you will. It is a marathon, not a sprint, but you know double-digit volumes keep going on and on and it is just going to be a situation that evolves over time but we see certainly no negative relative to where we've been and only positive as we go forward.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: In a way it's good that they are not growing faster, because we do not have enough cans the way it is.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Right, okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and the following question coming from the line of Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a good quarter.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: A couple questions, just more or less housekeeping stuff really, but can you, if I could zero in again on the metal food and household; you had a very, very strong performance there. When we look at the margin percentage, it is one of the best levels we have seen in quite a while, is it your view that with the pricing and such that you put through, even if considering the volume improvement, that the year-over-year, incremental change in margin is sustainable or a fact and continue to go up through the rest of the year. Can you give us a little more help there, Dave or John?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think maybe Ray ought to answer this question.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Love to Dave. When we talk about food and household, what I would like to tell you is we made no money last year. So we finally made some money. I mean, so while it looks a great improvement but we were, last year was brutal. So we are finally getting around to where we are making a little bit of money here, so let us not... we expect, we told you guys, it could not have gotten any worse, so we expect big improvements from that business throughout this year and as John said, the rationalization program that we announced in the fourth quarter, that really does not kick in until [ph] '09 so we look to be significantly better in that business throughout this year and next year.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay, for example for first quarter I think you did a little bit better than 5.5% margin, we should expect that for the full year, your business can do at least that with, subject to improvement due to restructuring next year, would that be a fair way to think about it?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's a fair way to think about it.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think probably on a comparative basis this quarter we just finished, since we, as Ray said, we did not make money last year, we did this year, will probably be our biggest percentage gainer for sure.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes. And remember last year in this business as time went on through the year we were getting better and better, not to where we needed to be, do not get me wrong, but as Ray said, we didn't make any money in the first quarter, so it's a very easy comp.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: That is helpful. Do you have volumes for plastics and aerosol by chance?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I do not, plastics on the commodity side of our business, on the monolayer side, they were down 6%, approximately, and on the custom side we were up about that similar amount, maybe a little bit less. On the aerosol side, I am sorry; I do not have the numbers off the top of my head.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay. The last question I had, was with respect to I think one of the markets you guys have talked about looking at and potentially putting a plant in India, if you could give us a little color as to how you think about that market, what will you think the potential, clearly there are a lot of people in India. But of what you think the potential might be for the beverage can there, the competitive landscape, a little more information on the thought process as you consider entering India.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, well, it's certainly a developing region, as we all know. Let me give an analogy. If you look back ten years into China, when everyone talked about the per caps were less than one can per person, but the reality is, you've got to look at the middle class and look at the buying patterns of the people there. The economy in India has been exploding. It has been going very strong and the middle class is growing at a far greater rate than many other places in the world and that's quite good for the beverage can. This year or in 2007 we estimated approximately a little bit more than 300 million cans and we have seen very strong double-digit growth in that over the foreseeable future and not to say it is without impediments. There are a lot of bureaucratic issues in terms of the various states within India that make it difficult from an alcohol perspective. There are a lot of religious issues that go on there that may impede a little bit on the beer side, but having said that it seems as every week you are reading about a new beer customer putting in new capacity and really investing for the future in that and we are just following along on the coattails of our customers.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay, that's helpful. That is all I have. Congratulations on a great quarter and good luck the rest of the year.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Thank you. The following question comes from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank: Hi, I have some questions about your capital projects. You mentioned 75% of them are going to be outside the U.S, I was wondering if you could break that down a little bit and give us more detail on that.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I can give you a little flavor on that. We expect, we are going to spend in the neighborhood of what we call, define as Europe, we are probably going to spend $175 million and that spending is going to be, as John talked about, we have got some new plants and speed-ups we are doing in Europe, so we are spending a lot of money in Europe and really most of that is for new top-line growth. We have got to finish our Project NET that somebody referred to earlier in the U.S where this is the final spending of Project NET in U.S and it is delivering the results that we said it was going to deliver and we will be spending in the neighborhood of, in total in the U.S beverage cans, we will be spending probably $75 million to $80 million on U.S beverage cans and really the rest of the businesses we are spending less than depreciation.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that's helpful. I am also wondering, the shift with China to the Americas, is there do you have a rationale for that or are you going to provide some restated information too?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we already did that and if you look at your press release financials attached, those are...
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank: I wasn't sure if you gave all four quarters for 2007.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, you will get all four quarters eventually, but that's just for the first quarter, but those are our restated and the reason we changed it is we had a management reorganization that we announced in January and as a part of that reorganization, people's responsibilities changed and when that happened, we reorganized our segments in accordance with how we expect to run the business.
Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the following question comes from the line of Keith Morgan, Kofting [ph]. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning gentlemen. I have got a couple of questions. First in regards your European BevCan business. I just wondered if you could help break out the 13% volume growth between capacity additions at Hassloch and Hermsdorf and sort of more underlying picture first of all.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I am not sure I understand the question because overall growth for us was 13% and I think the industry was about that same amount as well. We would not have been able to supply it if we did not have the Hassloch and Hermsdorf lines up, but where we are seeing growth is continued trends of what we talked about before and in fact I would say even a little accelerated growth in Western Europe. For example, in the U.K., partially because of the economy, partially because of smoking ban and other things, we saw double-digit growth in volumes there which we have not seen for a long, long time, so.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that is a good number.
C: John A. Hayes: Certainly.:
Unidentified Analyst: And just on diesel costs; I mean I understand diesel prices have increased quite substantially over the last three to four months. Just wondering how much of an issue that is for your business and whether you've got any option here to hedge your exposure or whether it is a delayed pass-through in terms of the pricing from your supply base?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we have been looking into, over a year, of how to hedge diesel costs, but as you pointed out, that's been going up quite rapidly and to date we have not found a mechanism we are happy with on how to hedge it, but we've been, just say we've been constantly looking at it for a while.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Some of our contracts have pass-throughs for those kinds of costs, some of our contracts are freight delivered, some of our contracts are actually the customer pays the freight, so it's all over the map. Some of it is passed-through and some of it isn't.
Unidentified Analyst: Is this a cost increase that worries you, you will see, I think aluminum increases have been obviously an issue for the last couple of years and you are obviously attempting to recover those whereas the spike up in diesel seems to have become particularly pronounced over the last three to four months.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes on a relative scale, it's not the biggest cost driver in our business, but it is not unimportant. And as Dave alluded to in talking with our customers as our contracts are up for renewal in those places where we are not able to get recovery, we are certainly focused on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, understood. Thanks very much for your time, guys.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos. Please proceed.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Thanks, hi guys. Three questions. First off, in aerospace, are there any key projects that you can lay out for us that we should be on the watch for? That will help the backlog and will be positive for the 2009, 2010 timeframe?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I cannot give a lot of information there. A couple things that we are following pretty closely that are significant. One is that I can't talk about, another is a communications satellite. What John was talking about is that we think we are well positioned to win our share of work but with a continuing resolution in the country right now, budgetary wise, new starts are hard to come by so that is some of the delay in some of the business that we see. We have got a lot of proposals, though, that are active. We do win work. We won a little less than we did in the first quarter, as you saw from the backlog number, but I can't, I would not say there is a program that's make or break. It's a number of things. A handful are pretty good sized. We hope to win our share of those and we hope to see our backlog moving on up. I think realistically though we are in a presidential election year, I am sure you know that because you can't help but know that given all the publicity around it, and that really just slows things down a little bit in this business. It happens every four years. So, it is not a crisis. We are continuing to do well. We are expecting a pretty good year in aerospace actually overall. Maybe not quite as good as last year in terms of sales, profits may be a little closer to last year, but we continue to work really hard on trying to figure out how to position that business well and win our share of the work, George.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Sure. I wasn't using make or break in my question, and I know there is a lot of stuff you cannot talk about in aerospace, but that was helpful. Second question, in food and household, if there is a midyear tinplate price hike, we do not expect it, but who knows, may be there could be one. Would you go out and raise pricing to your customers to offset that?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, George, as I think a lot of people were aware of discussions around surcharges or increases that you read it in the paper all the time. We believe that our contracts with our suppliers are clear and they do not allow for any of those midyear increases.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Understand.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: We will, we are going to defend this position on behalf of our customers. Nearly all of which our customer contracts do have pass-through provisions and we are not going to take on the commodity risk.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: So, if there is an increase that is announced, one you would fight it because you feel you have the right to fight it, but if you ultimately have to take it then you also have the right and expect to raise pricing to your customers. Is that a fair summation?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: It is, if you assume that it would happen, but we think our --
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Understand.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Contracts with our suppliers are clear.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Okay. Last question. I think you said Kent was earning cost of capital, is that a fair assessment in terms of why you closed it and aside from it being maybe an older facility, were there any customer dislocation that occurred that caused you to shut it as well and then maybe it was not earning cost of capital for that reason?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think you may have, you said it was earnings cost of capital, I think you meant to say it was not and that is the truth, it was not and has not.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Right.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It has not. John mentioned one piece of business that we passed on a year ago or more.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Okay.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That hurt a little bit, but also the region of the country had probably a little too much capacity. We decided that, you remember, not so many years ago, we do not like to do these things for practice, okay.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Yes.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So I think this is the exact right thing to do at this point in time for us.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The other part, George remember, I know a lot of our shareholders do not like that we are spending capital, but when they see the results coming out of Europe, I imagine they like it a little bit better, but we have got capital spending. We talked about India and other places that we have got that we think we can get good returns on these assets and we are going to redeploy these to make proper returns.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: In areas where you haven't recovered costs as well as perhaps you would like, are those facilities or contracts largely under cost of capital as well, below cost of capital as well?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that would be right, but I am not sure I exactly sure I understand your point.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Well, I guess if Kent was not earning cost of capital and you shut it and you have said you are on a two to three year timeline to improve the trajectory in returns across the whole business and you haven't recovered costs as well as you would like in some areas of your Americas beverage can business that where you can't recover your costs as well as you would like, those facilities that might be subject to closure. Would that be a fair assumption?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean, that is not a forecast that we are not closing anything, but we look at all that all the time and we look at supply-demand situations, customer situations, where we think the market's going and reached a conclusion this was timely. As Ray said, we also have another use for some of this equipment that is a better one and I think we are going to make commitments to supply our good containers where we can make a return.
George L. Staphos - Banc of America: Dave, is it adjusted for the size of the business relative to the other segments? Obviously it is your biggest business, but is Americas' beverage the biggest opportunity for you, Americas' beverage can, the biggest opportunity for you to improve your returns over the next two to three years?
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it is our biggest business so if we --
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: So we adjusted for that.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we adjusted for that? Probably, I do not know. I would say the global beverage can business certainly is because that two-thirds of the company in terms of opportunities where we are spending our capital to grow in other parts of the world we are changing the footprint, making more specialty cans here in North America, but if you look, I see opportunities in all parts of the packaging business and I don't know that I could say exactly where it will happen but understand that in the North American BevCan business, it's still a very, very good business. It's just that as I say, particularly in the 12-ounce, we have got to get a better economic proposition. John, what is your term that you use to get paid for the value that we deliver?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: More fun.
R. David Hoover - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that part too. Having fun is mandatory.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. During this presentation, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is recorded on Thursday, January 24th, 2008. It's my pleasure to turn the conference over to Dave Hoover, Chief Executive Officer at Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Pam, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's second quarter 10-Q and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. And if you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Further information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. So, with me today on today's call are Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and John Hayes, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Ball Corporation. Yesterday we announced John Hayes' promotion in a news release. John did an excellent job running our European business and we look forward to having him as Chief Operating Officer for all of our businesses. Bringing John here was the first of several steps which together strengthened our overall management team. Mike Herdman, who has been President of our Metal Beverage Packaging Americas business is now head of our European beverage can business. Mike has extensive experience in the beverage can industry and the European market. John Friedery is taking on responsibility for both our Americas and Asian beverage can operations. John came up through our North American beverage can business and he knows it inside and out. The end result is an excellent management team with people in positions where their experience and skills can best help us. Now turning back to 2007 results, on a comparable basis our diluted earnings per share were $3.50 in 2007, up 21% from our previous record of $2.90 in 2006. This came despite a difficult fourth-quarter comparison. While we are generally pleased with our results, we are taking steps that we believe will lead to further improvement in 2008. I will talk more about that later. But first Ray will discuss our financial performance and the John Hayes is going to make few comments. Ray?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave. Overall, the fourth quarter numbers came in pretty much as expected. North American beverage can fourth quarter earnings were lower than last year due to non-recurring inventory gains earned in 2006. Aerospace quarterly earnings were lower primarily due to unabsorbed labor and higher proposal cost in the quarter. Corporate costs were down in the quarter also due to lower employee cost. That being said, both North American beverage cans and aerospace produced record earnings for the full year. Comparable diluted earnings per share of $0.60 was the company's second best ever for the fourth quarter. Full year comparable diluted earnings per share of $3.50 is up $0.60 compared to last year, and that is better than our long-term goal of 10% to 15% improvement annually over time. Higher margins in North America beverage cans and strong sales volumes in aerospace and international beverage cans resulted in record full-year earnings for all of those businesses. Continued strong sales growth in Europe and China, including growth in custom can volumes Europe and the strength of the euro were the primary factors in higher international beverage can earnings in the quarter. The higher euro added $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.11 for the full year compared to last year. Comparable fourth quarter and full year operating results in the food and household segments were flat with last year and we believe we have hit the bottom in this business. We are assertively pursuing price in this marketplace and are implementing numerous cost reduction initiatives. We expect considerable earnings improvement in this segment in 2008, but will still be along way from being finished. On our third quarter conference call, we announced the plant rationalization plan to address some of the performance issues in this segment. We've closed two aerosol plants and exited the decorative tinplate can business, and that resulted in a fourth quarter after charge of $27 million that was recorded to reduce this action. Once completed, this capacity reduction will result in the elimination of ten manufacturing lines and yield annualize cost savings in excess of $15 million. The cash cost of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries. We are not satisfied with the results in either the food and household or plastic segments and anticipate further actions which could include more capacity reductions or additional value creating measures. Turning to taxes, our full year tax rate of 30% on comparable earnings were slightly higher than last year's rate of 29%, due to primarily earnings mix. Our initial estimates for the full year 2008 effective tax rate is in the 33% range. Turning to the full year free cash flow, even with some year-end build up in food and house hold inventory level, 2007 adjusted free cash flow of $440 million was better than expected primarily due to lower capital spending in the fourth quarter. As discussed on previous calls, we made a $45 million, $27 million after-tax incremental pension plan payment in the fourth quarter, mainly to fund our North American pension plan obligations to 95% level or higher. This incremental after-tax payment is effectively debt pay down and has been treated as such in our free cash flow computation. Full year 2008 free cash flow is still a bit of a moving target due to capital spending and year-end 2008 working capital levels not being fully locked in as we speak. Notable 2008 free cash flow reductions from 2007 levels will be higher capital expenditures, higher cash taxes and a one time after-tax payment of $42 million related to a customer settlement reached in the third quarter of 2007. These 2008 free cash flow reductions will be partially offset by lower working capital levels at the end of 2008. 2008 capital spending will exceed $300 million. We have a number of good growth opportunities in front of us. Approximately 75% of the capital spending would be in our world wide beverage can business and more than 50% of the spending will be for new top line growth projects, primarily in Europe. Cost reduction and maintenance capital spending is forecast at 60% of depreciation expense. The credit profile of the company remains strong with net debt at the end of 2007 at $2.2 billion. The 2007 rolling four quarters adjusted EBIT-to-interest coverage is at 4.3 times and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is at 2.4 times. The solid credit profile and continued strong free cash flow will allow for an increase in our stock buyback program to around $300 million for 2008, including accelerated stock buyback announced in December. We expect our 2008 credit ratios to be unchanged to slightly better as we get to the end of 2008. With that, I'll turn it over to John Hayes.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Ray. I'm obviously excited about this new opportunity and I'm honored to be given the responsibility of Chief Operating Officer of Ball Corporation. Over the past three or four years, it’s been gratifying to play a role in the success we've had in Europe. I'm proud of what our team there has accomplished, making money and having some fun along the way. I look forward to working more closely with Dave, Ray and the rest of Ball's senior management at the corporate level as well as our individual operating units throughout the world. This morning's earnings release announced Ball's plan to build a metal beverage can plant in Lublin, Poland. The Polish can market continues to experience significant growth, up more than 30% in 2007. We sell significantly more cans in the Polish market than we produce locally, particularly on the beer side of our business. While our existing plants in Hermsdorf, Germany, and Radomsko, Poland, serve us well for Western Poland and Central and Southern Poland respectively, the Lublin plant will provide us with good geographic coverage in Eastern Poland and position us to serve even better our customers there as well those in countries further to the East: Ukraine, Belarus some of the Baltic states and even the Western part of Russia. It's important to note that 2007 was a milestone year for the overall European Beverage can market, which for the first time overall volumes exceeded 50 billion units. Equally important, the overall market grew by nearly 10%, representing volume growth of nearly 5 billion cans in hands. I know that several investors and analysts have inquired about our views of the overall supply demand situation in Europe. I can assure you that this is a critical issue for us in our growth plan and we believe strongly that the continued growth expected in the European marketplace will more than compensate the additional capacity coming on stream. I'm confident that the totality of our European business is in good hands under Mike Herdman's leadership and the leadership of others at Ball in Europe. Similarly, we are also fortunate to be able to draw on John Friederys experience and skills to add to a strong North American Beverage Can management team. We have high expectations for both of them in their new roles. My focus is to improve the growth and operational performance, the execution across all of our businesses and I'm eager to dive in deeply into this immediately in order to meet our goals and objectives as a company. With that I'll turn it over to Dave.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John, and thank you, Ray, for your comments. Our aerospace and technology segment is coming off a remarkable record year that will be difficult to duplicate. Still, we expect strong results in 2008. Last year, if you recall, we enjoyed an exceptionally strong first quarter in aerospace and in the metal beverage Americas segment. This year, we expect them to be a little lower, but we're also working hard throughout the rest of the company where operations are expected to perform better, and that will partially offset we believe a challenging first quarter. I think the organizational changes that we've just made really position us to get the most out of our businesses. John Hayes has been working at Ball now for more than nine years, but he and I have actually worked together for more than 15 years. The first six of those or so were back in the 90s when he was a banker and I was CFO at Ball. We made substantial and significant change in the company during those years and it really changed the game around our company. And he was heavily involved in the acquisition of our European business and he and I together basically worked that. So, I've got great confidence in his abilities and I know him. And I know his character and I know his energy level and I know he's going to do a wonderful job for the company. Our Board carefully considered this. We spend time, energy and effort on succession time around here. We actually do it; we don't just write about it. And I had the pleasure really of meeting one on one with each director last summer, through the... through 2007 to consider what should we do in this regard. And we're all delighted and we have great expectations. One of our investors I think asked Ann Scott yesterday if I was sick and there are probably a lot of different opinions about that, but I don't think I am, and I'm not planning to do anything but continue working here and trying to build Ball. I am, as I said earlier delighted with John Hayes' new role, and I think with Mike and John Friedery in their roles, we're going to make some noise. As we said in 2007, while we believe achieving last year's first quarter results would be difficult, I believe we have the opportunity to exceed the full year earnings of 2007 this year. We have hit the ground running this month. I'm very excited about this year and what we can accomplish. And with that, Pam, I think we're ready for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now proceed to the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'm pleased to state that our first question comes from the line of George Staphos, Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead, sir.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. I guess just to start, congratulations to you John, John and Mike n their new roles and good luck in the upcoming years. The first question I had maybe for John, John what do you think you and the team will be able to do most quickly in terms of improving the performance in the business that have been struggling a bit over the last several years? Food and household and PET obliviously have restructuring program, what else could you fill in around that program that you haven't already discussed, that you could discuss and around the businesses in general. Thanks.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Let me start with food and household products. I think we've a very clear line of sight of what needs to be done. We need to be looking at pricing, we need to be looking at product mix, we need to be looking at our cost, and we need to be looking at purchasing, and we have a specific plans focused on all four of those activities. And if we're able to execute successfully on that, it's going to take a little bit of time, but we feel confident that we are going to be able to significantly improve the performance of that business. On the PET side, we all know it's been difficult over the years. We have a very large a customer, we have contract negotiations ongoing with them and we have to get price. And that's the near-term objective on that. Once we get through these contract negotiations, we'll have a much better sense of where we stand and from there we'll be looking at various things to make sure that we're in the short and long term maximizing the opportunity for Ball.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: John, on the contract negotiations, those could be included in one way or another sometime this year but they also could extend into '09 from what I recall. I got from a press release which I'm not sure necessarily you put out, what else should we be looking for in terms of you reaching that milepost with those contract negotiations?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, I think we have quarterly earnings calls and I think, it’s over generally just providing an update on where we stand relative to that. But, it’s… we have contracts coming up for renewal all the time in all of our businesses. So, I don't think we would expect to have any special press release.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Well, I understand, that is why I asked the question. So, when do you think these larger contracts should be addressed, one way or another? Is it an ’08 event?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I think it is an ’08 event, yes.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. All right. And one quick one for Ray and I will turn it over. Ray, if I heard you right, you said the leverage ratios should be relatively unchanged or improved as we look out to 2008. You also mentioned, in total the company hopes earnings per share anyway to be in line or better than the 2007 level realizing that share repurchase is going to play a little bit of a role there. Do you expect that you will be able to pay down any debt in terms of improving those leverage ratios or is it truly just the earnings and EBITDA growing that will allow for those ratios to come lower?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have looked at our capital structure, we always do that, as you know when we've taken a strong look at our capital structure, we think we are above where we want to be. So we think the improvement comes from the improvement in EBIT and EBITDA. We are not looking for a lot of debt pay down this year. Remember, some of that depends on the euro. If the euro loses a little bit of its strength then we are going to get some debt pay downs, if we still got $600 million of debt denominated in euros. So, I am not looking for a lot of debt pay down in 2008. We are going to use the money and we are going to go buyback our stock.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: But that suggests that you will get free cash flow, even after the settlement payment of $300 million, is that right?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are looking to have free cash flow around the same amount as our stock buyback, give or take.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thanks. That's excellent. Turn it over.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead, sir.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: Hey, guys. Good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: Congrats to everyone and more importantly Dave, I am glad you are feeling okay.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks a lot, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: On the European beverage can side, I was hoping you could give us a breakdown of volumes and I guess I am a little bit surprised because margins seem to have tracked quite a bit lower than last year. Could you just give us some color on that please?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, actually the fourth quarter started of slow. Remember in the third quarter, I talked about a horrible summer and it was catching up. I think overall though it did finish strong. The overall market was up about 10% and we were right in that range as well. I think on a margin basis, I wouldn't read into that too much. Similar to what we did in North America, we took some maintenance, because remember we have been running flat out for about 18 months or 20 months after the fire and we need to prepare for what we think is going to be a very strong 2008. We have the European Cup coming, we have the Olympics hopefully we will have a more normalized summer. And all the trends we see in growth in the European marketplace continue. And so we took a little bit of downtime in terms of maintenance over the Christmas holiday so we didn't have to pay additional labor to run it and that's what partially looked at lower margins, but again, I wouldn't worry in that going forward.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: Just to clarify, the 10% was the fourth quarter year-over-year or was it the full-year '07 number for volume?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: So, that was outlook, a good point, it was both. The fourth quarter finished just above 10% and the full year was just under 10%.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And just in terms of Americas bev, looking at the margins for Q3 and Q4, is there any reason to expect significant improvement beyond those levels in 2008 because the reason I am asking is the first half of '07, obviously benefited significantly from some of the aluminum impact.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I think that, what I was trying to say and what Ray was trying to say is that we did have that benefit in the first quarter of '07 and what our game plan is to offset part but probably not all of that, but if you look at what we recorded last year, I think we were up in EBIT $100 million. A chunk of that was in these areas that I mentioned including some metal games and Aerospace having an exceptionally strong first quarter so on and so if you integrate two years here technically we were up 21%, last year that's enough. We don't have to be up this year to hit our long term bottom end goal, but what we're trying to convey is it's really early in the year but we've got a good shot we think of having a full year better than last year. And from all factors including stock buy and improvement in performance so it looks pretty good in here from where we are.
Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Great thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you sir, continuing on our next question comes on the line of Claudia Hueston of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead ma'am your line is open.
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: Hi thanks very much good morning.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the Aerospace business, there was a little bit of down shift in the margins in that business in the fourth quarter, just wondered sort of what was going on there and then how we should think about them going forward into 2008 obviously was that a really good year in that business?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, two or three things in the fourth quarter, one we adjust rates to reality or to the actuals after the government's fiscal year starts or at the conclusion of it in September. So in the fourth quarter that contributed to some of the decline. Technically that was a part of that. The other part is these programs run at different rates when you're doing them in the fourth quarter just slowed down a little bit. We also had higher than normal un-reimbursed bidden proposal cost that we took in the fourth quarter. So those were the things that occurred. The… by the way congratulations on [inaudible] becoming...
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: Thanks very much.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: [inaudible] and I did read your piece and you used the words that you’ve heard us used that the business is somewhat lumpy. We get large programs that run at different rates and we are sort of been in that mode. We've just completed reviewing our business plans with our Board yesterday, and as we lookout over the next few years we see substantial opportunity in this part of our business but we, as I alluded to earlier I think this year of '08 might be a little softer than last year so that's where we are.
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That's really helpful and then I may be missed it but did you give any guidance around pension for 2008, sorry if I missed it.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're talking about P&L or you talking about cash.
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: Both I'd like actually.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: P&L will be slightly lower because obviously we got our pension plans funded up so that [inaudible] P&L charge, let's say that'll be... the P&L pension expense will be $5 million or $6 million lower and the cash excluding the one-time payment will also be probably $6 million or $7 million lower.
Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That's great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel and he's from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning gentlemen.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: First let me, echo early response David we are excited to hear that you are not sick.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: I never going to get over that one I can tell.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I'm glad to hear that and congratulations on your promotions.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: A couple of questions for you, first when we think about the extra capacity that is coming on in Europe, John Hayes I know you mentioned that the growth will be more than there to offset extra capacity and it looks like even for this year the markets will be extremely tight, has there been any pre-selling of that extra capacity coming online or anything of that nature that might impact yours or the industry's ability to get some sizeable net price increases this year in relation to the fact that the market is still so, so tight for '08?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: No. This is a sure answer. We have seen obviously when I'll speak only on behalf of all [ph] but when we go out there we know very cleverly with our customers and working for our customers but there is no pre-buying ahead and so we had plans in place to get recover our cost through price increases and net price increases in 2008 and again our sales shop has done a very good job of meeting the targets we set for ourselves.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, very good. So, I'm going to go back to a question that I know nobody likes but when we think about 2008 versus 2007 and normalized or your long-term goal being 10% to 15% improvement and we kind of think through the pluses and minuses '07 going in to '08 you’ve got pluses of again a very tight market potentially some upside in Europe. You've got I think you just mentioned earlier some lower pension expense. You talked about pretty exclusively some improvements in plast… in metal food and aerosol. What would be some of the puts and takes that might help or prohibit you from in fact being able to do a normalized 10% to 15% year looking in to '08?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, we said... what we said here Chris is that the first quarter and we have been saying this for a year the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year are going to be tough comps and we still feel that way but we also implying that we think we got a real shot at exceeding last year's earnings per share. So, for the full year of '08, which would mean that we would overcome sort of one-time good guys by some amount and it's the 24 of January and you've heard me say that before, so it is early days but what we have been discussing the last couple of days here at with our board and so forth would indicate that we think we can do that. So that's where you find us.
Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you sir. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump, Longbow… I believe it’s Longbow Research. I apologize for that sir.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Yes it's right. Thank you. Good morning guys.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, good morning.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: I just had a quick question to go back to the European bev can business obviously you have already discussed the fact that there were some maintenance in the last part of the fourth quarter that caused margins to be so low. And I guess just looking at that performance it looks like it's about low as it has been in several years on the margin side. Is there anything else going on there or is there anything that might be at all something that might pop up for first couple of quarters in '08?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: We don't see that. We obviously all of our business continue to have higher costs related to that and… but nothing material happens fourth quarter that should concern any of us. As I said I think the month of October was pretty slow in terms of volume, we did pick it up in the late November and December that start picking up again and I think all of that this was just a wash out of a summer. And we took some downtime and really that is the only differences that has been occurring.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay thank you and just one other question, here in the U.S on the bev can side, just want to get may be your overall take in terms of market demand for soft drinks had a pretty difficult year this year on the can side and it looks like there was some pretty beer cost increases, you are heading in to '08. Just want to get an idea how you think the overall market demand might shake out over the next 12 to 18 months in bev cans in U.S?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, I think you should look forward, let's first quickly review 2007. The overall market was down a little over 1%, deer was up, soft drink was down. And as you go you take those and you look into going into 2008 the question is, what is going to happen. I do think and I think all of us believe that the economy will play an impact into this and it actually bodes well for the can because it is much more of a value pack in North America, both in the beer and the soft drink side. I think with recessions, people generally stay at home more, which is take-home packages, which is the can and so we haven't heard anything explicit from our customer base that says there is a meaningful change but I think that at the end of the day it will be driven by consumer demand.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: And I would just add the specialty can business so-called are sizes other than the standard 12 ounce continue to grow at good rates. We have a large position in that market and we are about equal parts beer and soft drinks even though the market is about two-thirds soft drink and one-third beer in North America. So those are other things to keep in mind.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay, great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you very much. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, thank you. First question just for John Hayes with regards to Europe, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the confidence with regards to the growth in the European bev can market in 2008 and looking forward? And specifically in which region are you seeing the growth?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Okay. Well, we expect the growth to continue. I think 10% is a very strong growth. It was the strongest growth in Europe in a while. So we are not anticipating that. But I think over the next several years we have pretty good visibility and call it 6% to 8% growth across Europe. Obviously, you break that down and a lot of that growth is coming from Eastern Europe. Western Europe, which is much more of a core mature market was still up 4.5% however in 2007. The can... you are seeing a shift from two-way refillable bottles to the can on the beer side, you are seeing some shifts, I believe, from PET to the can. And as some of the major soft drink customers have done a very good job of executing, it has been helping us. Southern Europe continues to grow quite nicely and then as you go even further to the east in terms of Russia, places like that on a base of 5 billion cans is growing 30% per year as well. So there is a variety of factors that are affecting this, but we see the fundamentals being pretty robust over the, at least as far we can see which is probably two to three years.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And would you expect that if the European economy slows down generally that it is the same phenomenon that you would expect in North America that it wouldn't impact the can market and more people would stay home and consume more cans?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: I think the outcome would probably be the same. The reasons might be a little different because refillable bottles are take-home as well. But what people are looking for is becoming more western, becoming more convenient and at a price that isn't taking more out of their pocket. So I think all those things combined and we could talk country-by-country because it does vary so much by country, but overall a decline in the economies in Europe should not have a significant negative impact on us.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And anything new happening in Germany or is Germany just gradually coming back still?
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, consumption within Germany… consumption within Germany grew at double-digits. I do not have the exact number, but 10% to15% in 2007. So, again, it is a step-by-step. We have talked about this marathon versus sprint in the past and it indeed is. I think 2008 I know that a lot of European customers and those in Germany are going to be doing a lot of promotions around, particularly the European Cup and to a lesser extent, the Olympics. So, it is just getting the consumer re-educated about the can that was off the shelves for a while in Germany, and I think all the signs we point to say it is going to continue to move forward.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just a quick question for Ray with regards to the $300 million in share repurchase in '08, would you expect that to be back-end loaded or can you be participating in the market currently and taking advantage of the current share price?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We... you may have missed it, but we in December or early January we announced an accelerated share repurchase program we put in place. I think it was the 7th of January and that was $100 million program. So on the 7th of January we purchased $100 million of the $300 million shares. So it is front-end loaded.
Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Andy Feinman of Iridian Asset Management. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Thanks. You know the press release here says that all five of Ball's operating units were reported to Hayes. He will report to Hoover. Who is Ray going to report to?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is a good question, Andy.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: I am not sure whom he reports to now. I think it is me, Andy but not all the time.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Well, I am a big fan of them both, so.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: They have told me they like you too, Andy.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Thanks. So, the CapEx, would you care to... I mean it is going to be over $300 million, does that mean it is going to be $400 million?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: I mean can you narrow that down at all?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The reason I didn't want to get too specific because we are going to relocate some equipments. The timing of that can change the numbers. We also... the timing can also change. We decided to do something in March versus July, you're going to get a different CapEx number, but it is not a huge secret. I mean, fundamentally it should be, give or take around $350 million, give or take and when we get to the first quarter I'll refine that number for you.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: We also, Andy we... I think we exceeded even our estimates on last year's free cash flow $20 million to $25 million of that, Ray, is money that did not get spent last year that will get spent this year. So if you look at the two years together that is probably a good way to do it too, Andy.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Okay.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Andy, the important part of the capital spending as I tried to indicate is that, it is all going for top line stuff. This isn't sort of cost reduction planned stuff; this is for top line stuff that has got 10% to 15% margins on it. So, it is to follow the growth that John's been talking about.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: All right. Okay the... can you give us an idea what depreciation and amortization will be for next year? I guess it will be up a little because, so I just as long as I'm doing CapEx.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let us just see, it was like, what was it this year, it was...
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: $281.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, $281 million and it is going to be up about $10 million.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Okay. And the... my favorite question I recall at the end of the year, can you tell me how much the securitized receivables were?
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I just happen to have that number. Andy, I am glad you asked that. They are down by $33 million from where they were last year. Last year we finished at $203 million and this year they are at $170 million.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Okay. So that... and that is flat with the third quarter, so that is good. And I guess the last question I have is, when you look at this capital spending, I mean I understand these markets are growing so you are going to make 10% to 15% margins on the growth, and… but is there anything... I mean the stock markets has been down lately, so is there anything you could buy that might be even better?
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, possibly. I think we look all the time as you know, we don't often do things but we are conscious of the change in the credit markets and sometimes sellers don't understand that valuations have changed as fast as buyers.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Right.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: But I think you will see a more rational marketplace for those kinds of things. We aren't... we don't have a long shopping list but there are a few things that we continue to follow and look at that might make sense.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Okay. It doesn't sound like there is anything imminent? I mean it doesn't sound like this decline in the market has necessarily brought any of these things into active mode yet anyway?
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, of course I couldn't say one way or the other, but...
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: Yes.
John A. Hayes - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: One of the things Andy that I will say, we made some acquisitions 18 months ago or so and we need to make sure those are operating correctly. So a lot of what you are going to hear this year, particularly from me is about execution and I can make sure that we have a strong backbone because from there you can grow.
Andrew Feinman - Iridian Asset Management: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] We now have a follow-up from the line of Mr. George Staphos of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead sir.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. Hi guys, three questions. First of all with Aerospace, from the last quarter it was pretty clear there was going to be a bit of a down shift, fourth quarter until first quarter as you were, as you said I think earlier in the call not absorbing as quickly some of the fixed costs that are inherent in the business. My takeaway, perhaps incorrect though, is that '08 would be an up year. Has anything else fundamentally changed in terms of timing of the programs or is the outlook the same as it would have been a couple of quarters ago?
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think as we assessed the marketplace, we have bids outstanding on programs. One bid is going to be delayed in its award by a couple of months. That is not helpful necessarily, but I think we heard in our plan review George we have 500 active contracts in Aerospace. Many of them are fairly small but they are solid and they under gird the business. It s the... you win a $200 million job that you spend $100 million all in one year and then it tapers off and you spend $25 million for two years and then you deliver it, kind of thing. There is more of that... that ratchets around. I think you saw a nice improvement overall, full year in margins in the business. Practically when you understand how these rates are adjusted one time a year, I think we, some of the... well, I don't want to see it that way. You are accumulating this variance and then you make an adjustment in the fourth quarter, theoretically some of that really happened in the first three quarters almost, not exactly. We did the accounting correctly but I wouldn't overdo the negative message that you see in the fourth quarter results but I would say again that temper your... I don't necessarily expect Aerospace to be up in '08 versus '07, which was just a remarkably good year. And a lot of it had to do with a large, fixed-price WorldView-2 spacecraft that we’re building for DigitalGlobe. And by the way, the WorldView-1 that was launched in the... I think in the fourth quarter is just performing in an exceptionally fine manner. The images are great and this is an area that we have developed over the years that we are hoping gets traction, not only on the civil side but also within the DOD and the national security markets.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: It certainly makes sense.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: All right. That is helpful, Dave. Now, in terms of the question on '08 and how it might progress and obviously the difficult first quarter comparison to the extent that I can try to frame this question, such as you will comment on it. This year, you did $3.50. If we assume first quarter is your only down quarter and the subsequent quarters grow more or less in line with your traditional target, which is 10% or better, it would suggest that first quarter could be down anywhere from, pick a number from $0.15 to $0.25. Is that the type of message you want us to take away? I realize I've just put words in your mouth, but help us think about the progression.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: No, I didn't say that.
Raymond J. Seabrook - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Anywhere near that much, George I mean it's still down, but it’s still dominant, the wheels aren’t coming off here.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Oh, I understand but I went through my methodology because that is all we can go off of, but that is very helpful as well.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: That was Ray Seabrook who answered that question.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Yes, I understand. And then last, can you remind us what kind of performance threshold do you have to hit for the cliff vest restricted stock that you granted last year to actually be vested by your employees I know it’s over a couple of years, three years, but what kind of performance would you have to date?
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: We have to earn… our cost to capital are better, and of course that changes over time. Currently I think it is running a little over 6% weighted average cost to capital, but that… so that's the… we think we add value when we earn in excess of our cost to capital and we can pretty much demonstrate that historically. So that's the performance criteria that was associated with those restricted stock unit grants.
George Staphos - Banc of America Securities: Okay, thanks guys. Good luck in the quarter.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Sir, it appears that there are no further questions from our audience. We will turn it back to you Mr. Hoover to continue and for your concluding remarks. Thank you.
R. David Hoover - Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you very much and thanks everyone for joining us today. We will look forward to speaking with you again in April. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect. Thank you once again and have a wonderful day.
